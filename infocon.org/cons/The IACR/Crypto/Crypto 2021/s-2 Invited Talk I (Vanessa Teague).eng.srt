1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
moment

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,359
yeah

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,880
go ahead

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
okay great

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
uh thanks so um welcome everyone to the

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
first invited talk of crypto 2021

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,439
so we're happy and honored to have uh

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,000
vanessa tieg as our invited speaker

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
vanessa is the ceo of thinking cyber

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
security and an associate professor at

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
the australian national university

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,880
she received her phd from stanford

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
university in 2005 and her thesis was

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
one of the very first works that

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
combined cryptography and game theory

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,040
since then vanessa's been based in

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
australia and she did a lot of great

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
work has been doing a lot of great work

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
in particular she was very

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
she is very

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,559
extremely active working on technical

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,640
cryptographic problems that are of

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
public interest

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
so one example is protection of

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,399
government data she was a part of a team

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
that re-identified

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,199
doctors and patients in an open data set

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
set open data set published by the

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
australian government

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
which concerned over 2.5 million

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
people and she was advocating for

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,560
notifying the affected people

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
which resulted in a big backlash from

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,320
the australian government

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,880
who put pressure on her department

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
she was at the university of melbourne

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
at the time and she resigned over this

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,479
another example is the topic of her talk

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
today which is uh eve voting and

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
election integrity uh where she's also

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
done a lot of work and which was

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
recognized by a research excellence

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
award from the election verification

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,759
network

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
uh she both discovered vulnerabilities

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
in several

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
deployed systems as well as suggested

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
better protocols

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
and i'm looking forward to hear more in

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
her talk so i just want to say on a

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
personal note that i really admire

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
vanessa for being an outspoken advocate

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
for cryptography and

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,840
for society and for doing the right

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
thing so thank you

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
hey thank you tal and thanks for having

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
me everybody it's such a pleasure to

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
join crypto virtually when nobody can be

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
there in person

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
uh questions are really really welcome

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,399
i'm gonna not take up the whole

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,599
um

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
hour i'm gonna kind of hope to leave

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
some uh time for discussion for

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
everybody at the end

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
okay can you see my screen

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,440
yes which

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
which evoting problems do we need to

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
solve the

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
uh question is a deliberately a little

71
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,959
bit ambiguous because it's not clear

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,160
whether the

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
uh emphasis is meant to be on we or

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
solve and the answer is both so i'm

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
hoping that this talk can help other

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
cryptographers who are interested in

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
democracy in their own country

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
to

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,200
have a go at

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
making it better

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
everything i'm about to talk about is

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
joint work if i listed all the people

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
with whom it is joint work i'd be bound

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
to leave somebody else out but i always

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
feel bad giving these uh kind of invited

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
talks as if it's all about me when in

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
fact uh everything i'm going to say is

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
don't work with at least some other

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
um really really good people and one of

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
the funnest things about working in this

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
field of course is the rest of the

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
community okay so here we go

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
so democracy uh it's certainly in crisis

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
is it really stuffed well i guess i

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
wouldn't be giving this talk if i

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
thought the answer was yes but certainly

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
democracy is not looking that good at

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
the moment uh this is an article from

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,120
the

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
south china morning post which is kind

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,239
of tragic in itself it's from 2018 it

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
ticked me off at the time because of

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,239
this

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,480
idea this dichotomy between prosperous

105
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,239
authoritarianism and chaotic freedom

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
which apparently is a reference to some

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
quote by xi jinping about how chaotic

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
democracy is uh and uh the main thing

109
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
about this picture is of course now that

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
we can look back on it three years later

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,680
only one of these chaps is still in

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,840
charge of his country

113
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
and uh to me this is kind of the

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
superpower of democracy right no matter

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
how bad

116
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
no

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,040
i don't think anyone would claim that it

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
always chooses the best person but the

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
thing that it does is give us the

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
opportunity to get rid of somebody that

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
uh we really realize we made a mistake

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
about

123
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
however i think this picture indicates

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,079
to us that the threat model for

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
secure

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,240
electoral processes is about as hard as

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
it can possibly be right the adversary

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
is

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,479
the most powerful person in the country

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,240
who may be the most powerful person in

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
the world

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
and they have a degree of control of the

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
infrastructure and the process

134
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,440
and you have to assume that they're

135
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
willing to do just about everything to

136
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
stay in power

137
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
if we can't secure the process of

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
running a democratic election then then

139
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
we really lose i guess it's pretty

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
obvious we lose the

141
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
power of democracy altogether and when

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
the core property of a democracy is the

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
capacity to kind of self-correct

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
and revert

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
back to a different state if we don't

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,199
like the state we're in then

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
i guess

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
it's obvious that the security of the

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
electoral process is absolutely critical

150
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
so i don't think democracy is really

151
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
stuffed i think it is in crisis but i

152
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
think it is in crisis in a sense that we

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,759
can still

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
use that crisis to do something about

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
improving its security

156
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
in some ways the security of the voting

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
is the security of voting is better

158
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
motivated now

159
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
than than it has been

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,759
in the popular mind for a long time

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
so what can cryptographers do about all

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
this well this talk is addressed to

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
other cryptographers who'd like to help

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,680
support their own democracies and i'm

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
gonna kind of run with the working

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
assumption that uh most human beings in

167
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,440
most countries are basically rational uh

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,560
even though you might say that the

169
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
empirical evidence in support of this

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,039
this is a bit iffy at present i still

171
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,160
think it's really most literary

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
i'm not sadly

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
going to say very much about people who

174
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
are already living under authoritarian

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
regimes um i think it's horrific but

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
there isn't

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
i can't think of very much to do about

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,880
that i'm kind of assuming that this is

179
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
helpful for

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
residents of countries that are already

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
meant to be democratic and already have

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
some kind of democratic political

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
process that you can imagine helping to

184
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,159
support

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
okay

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
i've i've arranged the things that we

187
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
can do through the talk around three

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
approximate themes with icons as follows

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
first of all things we can do we can

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
find bugs and gaps in existing schemes

191
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
and tell people what the vulnerability

192
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,840
is in a thing they're already using

193
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,919
ah we can design nifty news claims with

194
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,039
uh

195
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,319
clever and interesting mathematical

196
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
properties

197
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,080
or finally we can teach people to think

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
adversarially and i actually suspect

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,039
that

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,960
if you've

201
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
if you haven't tried talking to your

202
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
local

203
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
authorities or parliamentarians about

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
security

205
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,319
it's

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,400
you probably don't realize how this

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
adversarial mindset

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,039
and thinking about an attacker is

209
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
unusual and uh you know it's a thing

210
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,560
that we do in this community but is not

211
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
a thing that most people think of most

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,720
people just kind of want stuff to work

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,360
so the first two things in my little

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
bullet list are fun right it's fun to

215
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
attack things and think about the

216
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
technical details of things it's fun to

217
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
design new schemes i assume if you're

218
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,479
listening to an invited talk at crypto

219
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,919
then you probably find the first two

220
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
things fun

221
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
the last thing is really hard actually

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
really really hard and often not very

223
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
much fun but i actually suggest that in

224
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
some ways that is

225
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
the most useful thing that some of us

226
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
can do for

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
democratic processes is just persuade

228
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,960
people that there is the potential for

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
attack and it helps them think through

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
um actually defending against

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
surreptitious attack

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,240
rather than the thing that almost

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,599
everybody else on planet earth does

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
naturally which is try and make sure

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
that everything looks okay

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
okay so what are the security

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
requirements of elections well uh they

238
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,199
really haven't changed for two and a

239
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,720
half thousand years

240
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
so the security requirements of

241
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,280
elections are public verifiability and

242
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
the secret ballot secret ballot is

243
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
important to stop people being coerced

244
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
to vote in a certain way and public

245
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
verifiability is important to stop

246
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
cheating and to stop people believing

247
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
that there's been cheating

248
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,679
so the the picture on the right is

249
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,000
uh jury voting discs from the athenian

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
agura from uh 400 something bc

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,880
and you can see that they're designed so

252
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
that

253
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
the difference between a guilty vote and

254
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
a not guilty vote is very subtle it's a

255
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
matter of whether the

256
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
little disc is perforated through the

257
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
center

258
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
um and so they're designed so that a

259
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
voter in this case a juror

260
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,920
can walk out in a public place

261
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
with the

262
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
vote they intend to cast in their hand

263
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
and they can chuck it into the right

264
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,760
earn

265
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,120
and everybody can see that everybody's

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
tossed exactly one

267
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
voting disk in but nobody can see how

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
any individual voted

269
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
so this process which is one of the

270
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,399
earliest voting processes we know was

271
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
clearly carefully designed with the

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
technology that they had in mind to

273
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
achieve these two crucial

274
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,480
um

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
security properties that are still the

276
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
crucial security properties that we seek

277
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
now

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
uh if you're in uh

279
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
france or

280
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
nearby countries you might have seen

281
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,519
this you might have this glass

282
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
voting urn kind of concept which again

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
is the same sort of thing you

284
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
uh put your vote in a little envelope

285
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
and then you put the envelope in a big

286
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
glass in and everybody can see that

287
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
everybody put exactly one envelope in

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,399
the end and then everybody can hang

289
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
around and watch the count afterwards

290
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
so how do we do this with computers well

291
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
the answer is it's hard because of

292
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
course computers are sort of inherently

293
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,880
unscrutinizable

294
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
so first question

295
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
um are there bugs or security problems

296
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,880
in existing voting schemes what do you

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,160
reckon

298
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
uh i'm not going to talk in detail about

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,959
all of these schemes but the short

300
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,360
answer is yes there are i'm going to

301
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
talk a little bit about the

302
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,839
errors that we've found in the swiss

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
post cycle system and what the

304
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
implications for ivote and new south

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
wales are

306
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
there is some very good security

307
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
analysis of a system called votes that

308
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
has been spruiked in the united states

309
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
i'm going to talk a little bit about the

310
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,240
chivitas jcj system

311
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
uh and

312
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,519
uh

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,120
i'm going to talk briefly about the

314
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
estonian system before we go on too far

315
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
okay

316
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,200
but but my point is if you look this

317
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
list is just about everything right this

318
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
is just about everything and everything

319
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
that we've actually tried in practice

320
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
over the internet has been

321
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,800
broken in some really substantial way

322
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,000
all right the first

323
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
thing that i'm going to talk about and

324
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
this is primarily not a technical talk

325
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
uh most of the technical details are in

326
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,040
i assume that if you care about the

327
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
technical details you've probably seen

328
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,279
it already

329
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
but i want to talk just briefly about

330
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,279
the

331
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,120
story surrounding the swiss post cycle

332
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
new south wales i vote internet voting

333
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,560
system

334
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
so for those who don't know this is a

335
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,240
story from a year or two ago

336
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,360
the

337
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
uh

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,760
swiss

339
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
cantons have the option of voting over

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
the internet in a way that is regulated

341
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
through the federal chancellery

342
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
but actually provided by swiss post

343
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
swiss post outsourced the production of

344
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,639
the software to a private company called

345
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,760
cycle

346
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,279
and the

347
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
federal chancellery imposed a bunch of

348
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
rules about

349
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
privacy

350
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
individual and public verifiability

351
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
and transparency of the source code in

352
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
the system

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
we found

354
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,680
two

355
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
well sort of two and a half

356
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,760
substantial bugs in the verification

357
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,200
mechanisms that were supposed to be part

358
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
of the system and which were required to

359
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
be part of this system by law for the

360
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
certification standard that it was

361
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
applying for

362
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,680
so there were two different ways in

363
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
which a cheating approver could pass

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
verification but manipulate the votes

365
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,120
and in this case the prover was the the

366
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,200
authority running the election so the

367
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,920
the uh the component doing the mixing or

368
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
the decrypting of the electronic votes

369
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
so the system used an implementation of

370
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,839
the bayer groth mixnet

371
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,800
uh and uh they also used

372
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
standard things that you will know about

373
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
uh the feature heuristic applied to sean

374
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
peterson proofs

375
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
uh they used pictures and commitments

376
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,079
for the biographics net there's nothing

377
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,560
wrong with any of these components

378
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,719
and

379
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,519
the but the problem arose

380
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
because of the way in which the specific

381
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
details fitted together

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
in the case of the bayer groth mixnet it

383
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
was implemented with peterson

384
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
commitments

385
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,639
without making sure that the trapdoor

386
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
wasn't known so pitterson commitments

387
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
are a trapdoor commitment system if you

388
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
know the discrete log of

389
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
some of one of the commitment parameters

390
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
with respect to the other commitment

391
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
parameter then it's a meet you can

392
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
immediately see that you can commit to

393
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
something and then open it any way you

394
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
like

395
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
in this system

396
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,959
the designers failed to specify that you

397
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,519
had to verify that the parameters have

398
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,040
been properly constructed and in fact

399
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
it's even a little bit worse than that

400
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
they um

401
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
they actually constructed it in such a

402
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,480
way that the mixers who were proving the

403
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,199
shuffle did actually know the trapdoor

404
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
uh even in the just the ordinary honest

405
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,800
run of the protocol

406
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
so this is don't work with sarah jamie

407
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
lewis and olivier pereira and it was

408
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
independently noticed by thomas haynes

409
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,399
and ralph haney

410
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
and it's it's it's

411
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,360
easy to see that if you can run the if

412
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,320
you are the prover in a bayer and graphs

413
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
mixnet and if you are

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
able to open if you know the trapdoor

415
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
for the commitments you've been using to

416
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
commit to the permutation matrix then

417
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,880
you can easily see that you can

418
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,040
you can kind of commit to one

419
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,680
matrix prove that it's a permutation but

420
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
then when you actually come to mix you

421
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,199
can mix with something else so this

422
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,160
allowed a cheating mixnet that was

423
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
supposed to be shuffling the votes to

424
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
substitute votes

425
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
but provide a

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
proof transcript that passed

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
verification and in fact was

428
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
indistinguishable from an honest one

429
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
so that was not good

430
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
and then in a separate thing

431
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,279
another important detail was that when

432
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,920
they were implementing their decryption

433
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
proofs

434
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
they used a weak version of the fiat

435
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
shmear heuristic in which they didn't

436
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
hash all of the statement

437
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
and that would have been fine against

438
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
approver who

439
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
was not adaptive that is a priver who

440
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
couldn't choose the statement but it

441
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
turned out in this system that they

442
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,880
needed an adaptively secure

443
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,839
uh primitive because uh in fact provers

444
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,279
could partly choose the statement that

445
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
they were proving and in this case

446
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
uh the weak fear chemical heuristic was

447
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
not sufficient

448
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
so uh this this bug allowed a

449
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,199
authority that was doing decryption

450
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,720
to

451
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
fake a proof

452
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
that the cipher text actually decrypted

453
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
to something else and they didn't have

454
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
much freedom over what they could choose

455
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,120
so they really could only turn a valid

456
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
vote into a vote that looked like

457
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
nonsense but they could still pass

458
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
verification without honestly decrypting

459
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,600
okay so the technical details i assume

460
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
if you if you care about the technical

461
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
details you've probably already read it

462
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,480
but the bottom line is there was nothing

463
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
wrong with any of the

464
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
components as such in the sense that

465
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,120
there's nothing wrong with peterson

466
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
commitments or the biograph mixnet uh or

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
even with the weak fetch me heuristic

468
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,639
there's a problem with the context in

469
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
which they were used requiring different

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
security properties from the way that

471
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
they were implemented

472
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
this is going to be a bit of a thing

473
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
so the interesting thing about this set

474
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,160
of bugs

475
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
was that because they

476
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
existed in one vendor's solution

477
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,399
they affected two different software

478
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
systems on opposite sides of the world

479
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
we found out about them in the context

480
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,160
of the swiss system because the swiss

481
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
had implemented a transparency program

482
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
and in fact had transparency regulations

483
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,279
but we found out afterwards

484
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
almost immediately afterwards

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,559
that the same buggy

486
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,799
mix net and decryption system

487
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,520
was already in use in the australian

488
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
state of new south wales so part of the

489
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
interesting thing for this talk is to

490
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
look at how those two different places

491
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,959
dealt with these this almost identical

492
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,919
problem

493
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,880
okay so we had two different places both

494
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
realized that they had run or were

495
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,319
running or were planning to run in the

496
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,640
very near future broken systems in real

497
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
elections here's what happened in

498
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
switzerland uh this is the swiss federal

499
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,760
chancellor and you can see he's been

500
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
making some quite strong public

501
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,360
statements about how concerned he is

502
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,559
about the failure of the uh verification

503
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,799
in the internet voting system

504
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,720
the swiss

505
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
implemented

506
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
a large program of engaging technical

507
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
experts to completely reassess their

508
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
system and their regulations and their

509
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
ways of doing the assurance associated

510
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
with the internet voting system so i

511
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
think they correctly

512
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,000
interpreted this as not only a failure

513
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
of the software system

514
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
but in some ways more importantly for

515
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,679
switzerland a failure of the audit and

516
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
certification process that they had had

517
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
running to check that the system was

518
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
okay

519
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
so that's been thoroughly reject and

520
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,880
that process continues uh in some ways

521
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,320
they kind of double down on being more

522
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,559
swiss right more evidence more detailed

523
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,919
analysis more careful uh examination of

524
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,840
the facts

525
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
i don't know how this is going to go

526
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
um and i don't know

527
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
whether they are going to

528
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,559
stop voting over the internet keep

529
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,840
voting over the internet in a much

530
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
restricted form change their regulations

531
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
substantially or exactly what they're

532
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
going to do but i'm

533
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
confident in the evidence-based

534
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,679
process that they're running

535
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,960
so i'm not necessarily endorsing the

536
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
software in its current form or any form

537
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
but the process that they're running

538
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,960
is uh

539
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,160
very scientifically informed

540
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
okay so let's have a look at new south

541
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
wales

542
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
here's what happened in new south wales

543
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,919
i'm not aware of any member of the new

544
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,600
south wales government

545
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
making any public statement that

546
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,799
acknowledged at any point that they had

547
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,559
ever got the memo

548
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
about there having been a serious

549
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
problem in the verification of their

550
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,480
election uh there were one or two

551
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,919
members of parliament who asked the

552
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,679
electoral commission some pointed

553
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
questions about it

554
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
uh and after five or ten minutes of

555
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
fussing about here's the answer that

556
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
they finally got in a parliamentary

557
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
committee hearing

558
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
uh so this is

559
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,039
this is the electoral commission

560
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
answering a question from members of

561
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
parliament in response to being asked

562
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
about the security problems

563
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
so he says one of the principles that we

564
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
try to apply is to make it so it's

565
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
verifiable from the input of the vote

566
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
all the way to the count and it's like

567
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
well you it was just demonstrated that

568
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
you failed to apply that principle right

569
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
and yet here he is just kind of

570
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
declaring that that's a principle that

571
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
he ain't saw and it's like well that's

572
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
great in principle i aim for a field

573
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
middle and a front cover of vogue but i

574
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
haven't actually done any of the

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
achieving necessary

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,799
for

577
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
uh either of those things but hey we can

578
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
just declare that that's what we're

579
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
aiming for

580
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,159
uh and he goes on to say uh

581
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
he goes on to brag about

582
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
the uh audit

583
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
and um

584
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
certification process including that

585
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
they have a cryptographer who comes in

586
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
to check all the cryptography and ensure

587
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,480
that all the mathematical proofs operate

588
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
correctly now we have just demonstrated

589
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
the mathematical proofs did not operate

590
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
correctly but that seems to be kind of

591
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
an experimental error that we don't need

592
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
to worry about

593
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
so in in other work

594
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,039
my colleagues and i have also found

595
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,720
counting errors just nothing to do with

596
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,200
cryptography just bugs in their account

597
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,960
and they've basically responded to it in

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
exactly the same way so they've taken

599
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
the information that we gave them about

600
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
the mistakes in their account they've

601
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,080
declared that their software was

602
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,600
certified to be perfectly correct we've

603
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
said well it's obviously not perfectly

604
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
correct is it and they said oh no that's

605
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
okay we'll fix it and then they've sent

606
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,000
it back

607
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
to the certification authorities who

608
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
certified it perfectly correct and the

609
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,760
first place to be recertified after the

610
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
bugs we found have been fixed we've

611
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
cycled three times through this process

612
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
for the same piece of counting code and

613
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,919
each time we've found a bug it's been

614
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
sent back to the same certification

615
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
authority to be certified perfectly

616
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,840
correct again

617
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,080
so um

618
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
in some ways i sold this talk as giving

619
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,159
you the you know advice about how to

620
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,280
deal with

621
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,159
um

622
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,520
improving the quality of election

623
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,880
administration in this country but at

624
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,159
this point i sort of have to admit that

625
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,760
i oversold it because i actually haven't

626
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
got a clue how to deal with this i just

627
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,720
don't know how you deal with a complete

628
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
imperviousness to scientific evidence

629
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
but i still think it's worth a go so

630
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
here are in front of my little bug

631
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,039
bullet point i've written injecting

632
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
rational scientific evidence sometimes

633
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
works i hope it works in your country

634
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,400
uh and uh empirical testing is

635
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
encouraged go and give it a go

636
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,640
also another thing that made a huge

637
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,039
difference here is that switzerland had

638
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
transparency laws

639
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
about the source code and the system

640
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
details whereas new south wales has

641
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
secrecy laws it's a crime to share the

642
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
source code without the

643
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,559
um

644
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,000
authority without permission from the

645
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,360
electoral commissioner and you can go to

646
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
jail so

647
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
this makes a huge difference i think in

648
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
the capacity of a set of electoral

649
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
authorities to just kind of pretend they

650
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
haven't got a problem

651
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,840
so get transparency laws rather than

652
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
secrecy laws written in your democracy

653
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,240
if you can

654
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
okay before we all get too smug it's

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
worth pointing out that even the very

656
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,280
good quality

657
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
academic systems aren't perfect either

658
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
so uh this is a drug work with eleanor

659
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
mcmetre and olivier pereira we found a

660
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,280
bug

661
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,679
in the

662
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,840
chivatas

663
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
electronic voting system which is based

664
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
on jules katano and jacobson's coercion

665
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
resistant electronic voting scheme

666
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,760
this is one of one of the

667
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
most beautiful papers in this field one

668
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,400
of the first papers with a

669
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
complete proof of security for

670
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
its protocol

671
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
and it has this it relies on this idea

672
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,280
that you can take two ciphertexts

673
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,159
and the uh allow the authorities who

674
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,600
share the

675
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
decryption key

676
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
to perform a protocol that allows them

677
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
to test whether those two ciphertexts

678
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,760
are equal

679
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,039
without revealing any other information

680
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,360
this is called a plain text equivalence

681
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,799
test

682
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
but there's an important little detail

683
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,799
in the use of those tests

684
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,880
in this paper

685
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
and if you read the proof of the

686
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,919
coercion resistant voting scheme

687
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
it specifically says that it requires

688
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
universally verifiable plaintext

689
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,840
equivalence proofs in other words proofs

690
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
that remain sound even if all of the

691
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,159
authorities collude to lie

692
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
and then it it kind of references a

693
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,600
paper and says oh you know for example

694
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
you could use this this paper

695
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,679
but then if we go and look at the paper

696
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,760
the paper references

697
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,480
uses plain text equivalence tests and

698
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
those are specifically explained to be

699
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
secure under the assumption that at

700
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,240
least one participant honestly

701
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,440
follows the protocol so we have here a

702
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,400
misalignment

703
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
between the assumption that's made in

704
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
the protocol

705
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
and the uh

706
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
the security property that's guaranteed

707
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,200
from the primitive there's nothing wrong

708
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
with the primitive there's nothing wrong

709
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,960
with the protocol but the primitive

710
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,880
that's pointed to does not actually meet

711
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,600
the assumptions in the protocol

712
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,720
and the

713
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,559
test implementation just uses the thing

714
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,840
that is pointed to in the paper

715
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
but this misalignment means that

716
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,159
universal verifiability fails because

717
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,919
the plaintext equivalence tests that

718
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,480
they use are such that if everybody

719
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,440
colludes together they can make sure

720
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
that things can seem to be

721
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
equal

722
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
when in fact they're not and this breaks

723
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
the kind of basic verifiability of the

724
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,159
proof because the cheating set of

725
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,320
authorities can pretend that someone has

726
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
submitted a valid credential when they

727
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,158
haven't

728
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,960
so even helios has had bugs uh which is

729
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
exactly why olivier knew to look for the

730
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
weak feared shamir heuristic in the

731
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
swiss post system

732
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,559
because they had already found and

733
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,320
corrected the same bug in the in the

734
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,679
helios system

735
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,039
so i don't think any of this should

736
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,440
surprise anyone given that any

737
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
sufficiently large software system

738
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
almost certainly has these kind of bugs

739
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
but it kind of surprises me that people

740
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,120
keep being surprised and you still hear

741
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
very brave

742
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,559
um claims

743
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
about the

744
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
security properties of not just

745
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,600
protocols but

746
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,640
systems

747
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,919
for

748
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,440
internet voting

749
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
and i think another thing about this is

750
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,360
these misalignments of

751
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
primitive properties and protocol

752
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,679
assumptions are in all three of these

753
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,559
cases very subtle and i think it's i

754
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,520
should have written it as a nice little

755
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
exercise or challenge for people who are

756
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
interested in formal verification of

757
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,640
cryptography that

758
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
if you can think of

759
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,919
a

760
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
mechanism that adequately characterizes

761
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
details this fine i think that would be

762
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,080
a tremendous contribution but i think

763
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
it's very hard right it's very hard to

764
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
do in general

765
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
to make sure that any kind of formal

766
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
analysis or model

767
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,840
identifies those kinds of very subtle

768
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
differences

769
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
okay what about the estonian system

770
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
everybody knows the estonian system is

771
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
perfectly secure right well in an

772
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,120
astonishing coincidence olivier pereira

773
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,000
just happens to have published today a

774
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
new analysis of individual verifiability

775
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
in the new version of the estonian

776
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,559
internet voting system and you can look

777
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,360
at you can look up olivier's new result

778
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
at this github link down on the bottom

779
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
of the slide but the key insight here is

780
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
that the

781
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,960
combination of

782
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,520
simple verification that they have

783
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
with revoting

784
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,000
actually breaks individual verifiability

785
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so the estonian system has

786
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
really this very simple method of

787
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,279
individual verifiability you make a

788
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,640
ciphertext

789
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,159
you can submit the ciphertext if you

790
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,120
like

791
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,240
and you can just check directly

792
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
whether that's ciphertext has

793
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
the uh you can demand that that

794
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
ciphertext be opened and demanded that

795
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,919
they show you that it

796
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
produced the that that encodes the vote

797
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,600
that you wanted so it's it's exactly

798
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
like helios except that you cast the

799
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,159
thing that you challenged

800
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
so it seems very simple

801
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,399
except

802
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
it also has a feature that allows you to

803
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,799
re-vote and this is meant to be a

804
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,320
defense against coercion and because

805
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,520
it's meant to be a defense against

806
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,039
coercion it's important that the

807
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,960
verification process not expose

808
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,360
whether your vote has been clobbered by

809
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,799
a revote

810
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,520
so olivier's attack

811
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,159
really just takes advantage of this

812
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,039
opportunity for a cheating device to

813
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,480
revoke

814
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,760
and the feature that the user doesn't

815
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
get told whether or not the thing

816
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
they're verifying

817
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,200
has been substituted by a revote or not

818
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,960
so the attack is simply that the

819
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,760
cheating device

820
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
gets the voters instructions about how

821
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,799
they want to vote

822
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,399
makes a ciphertext

823
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
sends it off to the system but pretends

824
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,919
to crash

825
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,679
and then the voter tries to re-vote

826
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,799
again

827
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,600
and the cheating device

828
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
sends

829
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,320
a different vote which will now override

830
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,120
the

831
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
true voters first vote but it sends the

832
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
vote of the verification information for

833
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,840
the first vote so the voter is happily

834
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,919
verifying the ciphertext which truly is

835
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,080
the thing that they wanted it's just

836
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
that that ciphertext isn't the fact that

837
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,159
gets counted

838
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,200
so from our list a few slides ago of all

839
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
of the internet voting systems we know

840
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,399
we see

841
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,080
everything we know of has or has had

842
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,960
a

843
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
serious cryptographic errors which

844
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,320
completely undermine its basic security

845
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,799
properties

846
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
all right so everybody let's talk about

847
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
helios now because helios is actually

848
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,360
the best thing we have and i think it's

849
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
a great system

850
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,159
you know i really love it it's very

851
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,960
simple it's logic it's very clear

852
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,760
uh

853
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
it's had such good careful public

854
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
examination i'd be exceedingly surprised

855
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,799
if there are

856
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,000
further

857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880
really fundamental bugs

858
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559
but so helios takes us into a different

859
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,000
set of things that we can think about

860
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,360
now i want to think about

861
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,679
real people actually using it

862
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,840
so

863
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
i hope some of you 35 of you

864
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,279
participated or maybe not 35 of you

865
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,200
maybe just one person who voted 35 times

866
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
but anyway some people participated in

867
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,399
my highly secure online twitter poll

868
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,080
and i asked you

869
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,159
how many times you had challenged your

870
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,799
heliosphere in an iicr election uh and

871
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,159
for a long time there was nobody who

872
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,000
said exactly to actually so for the

873
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,919
first 48 hours or so of this sunday

874
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,279
there was about three quarters of people

875
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,760
who said one uh and about a quarter of p

876
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
sorry three quarters of people said none

877
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
and uh the remaining people all said

878
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,799
exactly one and i was going to say

879
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
well then there's an obvious

880
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,320
perfectly successful strategy for a

881
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,480
cheating client isn't that because all

882
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,679
you need to do if you want to get away

883
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,000
with cheating

884
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,440
a good sixth or so of the time

885
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,279
is to

886
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,960
tell the truth for the first cypher text

887
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,760
and

888
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,799
if the person casts a second ciphertext

889
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,200
to cheat on that ciphertext

890
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
and that would have worked

891
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,240
for the effective manipulation of about

892
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,000
20 of votes which would probably be

893
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
enough to swing the overall election

894
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,519
result

895
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,360
and then i see in the last few hours

896
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,200
someone has said that they actually

897
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,799
challenged exactly to

898
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,600
ciphertexts which is pretty exciting

899
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,919
and um

900
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,360
that is one person isn't it yes one

901
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,799
person over 35.

902
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,960
so now let's think a little bit about

903
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,679
what that means for our cheating kilios

904
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,200
client

905
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,760
there's kind of two ways to respond to

906
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
this possibility now right one is you

907
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
could be a very very careful cheating

908
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
helios client and you could be honest

909
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,679
for the first two

910
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
and uh assume that you could get away

911
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,960
with cheating on about three percent

912
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,840
and be completely undetected

913
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,919
the other attitude to take to this is to

914
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,440
say well you know i'm going to go back

915
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,840
i'm going to go back to the uh the first

916
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
cheating strategy i'm going to cheat on

917
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
the second

918
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
cipher text knowing that there's only

919
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,919
about a 10 chance

920
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,159
that it's going to be challenged

921
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,880
and if i get caught

922
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
i'm just going to pretend that the voter

923
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,799
doesn't remember how they wanted to vote

924
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,200
right in other words there's in this

925
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
system

926
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,120
there's very little disincentive for the

927
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,760
cheater

928
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,159
to get caught because even if they do

929
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
get caught it's really only the voter's

930
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
word against theirs

931
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,039
so this is another really important

932
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
design goal i think which some of the

933
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
in-person systems have but which the

934
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
internet systems as a general rule don't

935
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,799
have which is

936
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,880
if a component cheats

937
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,600
and if they get caught

938
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,279
then is it a matter of actually having

939
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,200
real evidence

940
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
that that component misbehaved or even

941
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,039
that the system misbehaved

942
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,480
or is it simply the voter's word against

943
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,039
the computer's word in claiming what

944
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,399
they what vote they asked for in the

945
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,000
first place and i think that really

946
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,559
matters to the incentives for cheating

947
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,039
okay uh final thing before i move on to

948
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,399
polling placement polling place voting

949
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,240
uh one argument that is often brought

950
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,360
out particularly in australia is that

951
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
voting over the internet is good for

952
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
voters with disabilities because uh it

953
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
makes it easier for them to vote but i

954
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
think this thing about helios that we've

955
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
just seen

956
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,159
shows that if anything it's exactly the

957
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,559
opposite right the real

958
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,720
verification particularly real cast as

959
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,560
intended verification even among the

960
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
most expert and paranoid people in the

961
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
world is actually

962
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,079
fiddly and really hard sufficiently

963
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,679
signed that most of us don't even bother

964
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
to do it at all

965
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,520
so this argument that

966
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
internet voting is

967
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,679
enfranchising voters with disabilities i

968
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,480
find particularly

969
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
particularly hard to take because

970
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,800
actually if because

971
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,440
actual casters intended verification

972
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,119
without coming into the polling place

973
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,918
and being able to deal with a um simpler

974
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
kind of paper-based system is the least

975
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,639
useful thing anywhere in security right

976
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,040
this is at best this is a way for

977
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,280
cryptographers to vote it is not a way

978
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,359
for veterans with disabilities to vote

979
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,879
at all and i i really think it's often

980
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,280
just used as an excuse to not set up

981
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,399
adequate provision in a polling place

982
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,200
for

983
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,359
people with disabilities to access

984
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,359
all right

985
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
okay so now now i'm going to transition

986
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,280
from internet voting to

987
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,720
things that can happen in a polling

988
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
place

989
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,520
uh and i want to say that in no way am i

990
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
dissing helios right just to be clear i

991
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
love helios and i think helios is

992
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
fantastic i think it's the best system

993
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,520
we have uh i use it whenever i have to

994
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
run a real election over the internet

995
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
when i'm not using the highly secure

996
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,560
twitter poll helios is fantastic uh it's

997
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
really really good

998
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,560
but it exposes this fact about people

999
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,920
that we don't bother checking things

1000
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,440
very carefully

1001
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
however it's very clear that this is not

1002
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,079
the fault of helios right not in any way

1003
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,079
uh and in fact this study shows that

1004
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,560
even if you do the simplest possible

1005
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,440
thing and just print out a plain

1006
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
paper ballot for people

1007
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,160
only about 40 of

1008
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,640
the participants in the study reviewed

1009
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,079
it at all

1010
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,920
and only 6.6

1011
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,640
actually noticed or at least

1012
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
told somebody else that they'd noticed

1013
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
that there was a problem

1014
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
so this study indicates that

1015
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
even if you don't add any fancy crypto

1016
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680
or any sophisticated challenging or

1017
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,839
anything the capacity for people to

1018
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
check when a computer just doing a basic

1019
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
simple printout has done something wrong

1020
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,320
it's very very limited uh they went on

1021
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,000
to say and this is again is going to be

1022
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,720
an important theme that quote carefully

1023
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,280
designed interventions and quote can

1024
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
improve verification performance in

1025
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,119
other words really making sure that the

1026
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,359
person is forced to or strongly

1027
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,880
encouraged or gently nudged to actually

1028
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
check what they're supposed to be

1029
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
checking

1030
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,800
okay

1031
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,040
so some of you might have read the three

1032
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,560
or four page abstract that i wrote

1033
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,240
in preparation for this talk that's gone

1034
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,000
into the proceedings and i wrote a

1035
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
little bit about code voting and

1036
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,760
usability based on the study by uh

1037
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,480
oksana kulik and uh melanie volkoma and

1038
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
some of their colleagues

1039
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
their studies showed that when code

1040
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,599
voting was incorporated into the voting

1041
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,400
process

1042
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,079
it was a lot more effective than the

1043
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,920
kind of challenge-based methods that

1044
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
helios uses

1045
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
um and the idea here so the idea of code

1046
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,040
voting is that if you're choosing just

1047
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,560
one

1048
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,079
candidate so you're just kind of

1049
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,960
conducting a simple kind of election

1050
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,440
one out of k options

1051
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,680
each option comes with a code that you

1052
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,839
get sent on some separate piece of paper

1053
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,440
and then when you choose that option the

1054
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,880
system kind of gives you back the code

1055
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,040
and you're supposed to check that the

1056
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,720
code you got matches the candidate you

1057
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,119
wanted to choose

1058
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,079
so

1059
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,760
uh it's been obvious to me for ages that

1060
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,680
this does not work for australia because

1061
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
we have preferential voting where you're

1062
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,280
expressing a list of preferences rather

1063
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
than choosing an individual candidate so

1064
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,680
i've never really thought about it very

1065
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,079
hard and i've just kind of

1066
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,920
looked at the empirical studies that

1067
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
come out of europe in particular

1068
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,160
it was pointed out to me after i wrote

1069
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,760
that abstract that it really doesn't

1070
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,320
work in the u.s either because there are

1071
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,640
zillions and zillions of contests so

1072
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,119
it's one thing to get one code for one

1073
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,400
kind of choice of party in a

1074
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,599
parliamentary election and it's a

1075
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,119
completely different thing to get one

1076
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,920
code for each of dozens of different

1077
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,119
options on a great big long us ballot

1078
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
obviously also the trust assumptions for

1079
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,400
code voting are a lot stronger than the

1080
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,920
challenge based mechanisms for helios

1081
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,400
but i'm just talking about the usability

1082
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,240
of it at this point so i think the

1083
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,680
bottom line is

1084
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
think about the requirements for your

1085
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
own country

1086
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,560
and realize that studies in other

1087
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,880
countries based on other kinds of voting

1088
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,960
systems and other sorts of assumptions

1089
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
are worth reading and interesting but

1090
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,640
not necessarily definitive when it comes

1091
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,839
to what works best for

1092
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,400
you

1093
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
okay receipt freeness is really really

1094
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,440
really hard this is uh the

1095
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
discovery of josh benello

1096
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,880
uh

1097
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,160
back in the 90s in stock and uh this so

1098
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
receipt freeness is a privacy property

1099
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,560
but a very very very strong one so not

1100
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,960
only should the system keep your vote

1101
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,079
secret

1102
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,160
but also it should make it impossible

1103
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,280
for you

1104
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,599
to prove how you vote it

1105
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,440
even if you actively want to

1106
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
so this seems to be achievable in a

1107
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,280
polling place assuming that the voter

1108
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,040
doesn't control the voting device

1109
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,599
because that allows us to hide

1110
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,720
uh

1111
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
detailed information like how the cipher

1112
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,800
text was made from the voter

1113
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,079
although of course you'd better hope

1114
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,119
that the adversary doesn't control the

1115
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,520
voting computer either

1116
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,680
there are also plenty of remote schemes

1117
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,839
which have a kind of a passive or sort

1118
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,000
of honest but curious version of receipt

1119
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
freeness where

1120
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,599
if you follow the protocol you can't

1121
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,320
subsequently prove how you voted

1122
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
but really being not able to prove how

1123
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
you voted even if you completely control

1124
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
the device and you've got the

1125
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,560
opportunity to communicate with the

1126
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,359
coercer deviate from the protocol

1127
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,119
and make up any part of what you want is

1128
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,680
really really really hard

1129
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,960
even in the polling place there have

1130
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,119
been a whole series of bugs found in

1131
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,880
good quality schemes that seem to have

1132
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,319
this property but actually turn out not

1133
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,040
too

1134
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,760
okay but nevertheless i think just about

1135
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
everything is easier in a polling place

1136
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,760
and here are five things that really

1137
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,319
stand out as being easier

1138
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,079
so first of all

1139
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,720
privacy or coercion none of these things

1140
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
are perfect by the way so the voter is

1141
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
usually alone uh

1142
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,560
of course if they have their smartphone

1143
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,079
or a pushy relative beside them that

1144
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
doesn't work so well but the idea but at

1145
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,680
least it works better and more easily

1146
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,520
than it does over the internet uh

1147
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
restate freeness again because we assume

1148
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,640
that they don't control the voting

1149
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,599
device

1150
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,440
accountability because depending on the

1151
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
design of the system

1152
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
you might be able to prove that the

1153
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,040
system malfunctioned of course this is a

1154
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,960
property of the system design but there

1155
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,359
are some systems for example systems

1156
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,000
based on pre-printed ballots in which

1157
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,920
you you can if the system misbehaves in

1158
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
some

1159
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
circumstances

1160
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,359
prove that it misbehaved without having

1161
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
to be trusted to

1162
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,960
recount

1163
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,240
how you instructed it

1164
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,640
uh it also just opens the opportunity

1165
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,720
for really easy individual verification

1166
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,359
because we can base it on a plain paper

1167
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,880
ballot under the assumption that

1168
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,119
somebody looks at it

1169
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,880
and also finally i think this point

1170
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,720
about the carefully designed

1171
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,319
interventions is actually really

1172
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
powerful and the opportunity to guide

1173
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
people through verification

1174
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,560
encourage them to do it properly help

1175
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,200
them out if they make a mistake is

1176
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,160
actually a huge benefit of voting in a

1177
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,960
polling place all the more so if we're

1178
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,480
using a complicated or fancy

1179
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,839
cryptographic design that people might

1180
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,000
not understand very well i suspect that

1181
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,119
a lot of the

1182
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,200
motivation for internet voting is

1183
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,359
actually that it kind of keeps these

1184
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,200
problems out of sight

1185
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,119
when actually it would be much better to

1186
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,560
bring them into the polling place and

1187
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,359
guide people through them

1188
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,280
okay uh risk limiting audits uh i don't

1189
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,400
know if you've heard about this if

1190
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,160
you're in the us you probably have if

1191
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
you haven't

1192
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,520
uh the this is an entirely statistical

1193
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,040
concept although i think a statistical

1194
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,800
concept for which cryptographers could

1195
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,760
have a lot of sympathy the idea is

1196
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,000
that

1197
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,200
we assume that the paper ballots are all

1198
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,079
good

1199
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,920
so we assume that the paper ballots have

1200
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,680
been carefully looked after properly

1201
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,240
secured and so forth

1202
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,040
and we

1203
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,560
conduct a randomized statistical order

1204
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,760
of the

1205
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,040
paper

1206
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,480
evidence

1207
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,599
to give us

1208
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,040
either to detect that there's a problem

1209
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,400
or to give us some confidence that the

1210
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,680
answer is right

1211
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,800
and there's some very beautiful

1212
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,240
statistics and some very thorough

1213
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,480
analysis that show that you can design

1214
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,240
auditing algorithms in such a way that

1215
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,000
you can prove

1216
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
that the probability of mistakenly

1217
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
accepting and certifying a wrong

1218
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,480
election result is

1219
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,560
is bounded by some risk limit that you

1220
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,720
can choose in advance

1221
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
and the idea is that you go you go along

1222
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,319
doing this audit of the paper ballots

1223
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,680
until either your risk is satisfied or

1224
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,480
you

1225
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,079
decide that

1226
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,240
the evidence is inconclusive and you

1227
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,040
manually count all of the paper records

1228
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,560
so there's extensive theory for all

1229
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,240
kinds of election setups most of it is

1230
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
oriented around the us but there's

1231
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
plenty of extensions for

1232
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,599
uh instant run-off voting dehaunt

1233
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,040
european style kind of parliamentary

1234
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,960
elections and so on there's open source

1235
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,160
software from a couple of different

1236
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,319
places some from philip stark and some

1237
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,200
from voting works by benedita

1238
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
but of course there are also obvious

1239
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,800
trust assumptions and limitations right

1240
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,480
you can only participate in this

1241
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,079
verification if you are physically

1242
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,520
present because you have to look at the

1243
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,560
paper ballot being retrieved

1244
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
and there's this huge assumption on the

1245
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,880
custody the secure custody of the paper

1246
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,839
parts

1247
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,839
now it's an interesting little fact that

1248
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,760
if you actually think about how to run a

1249
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,520
risk limiting audit there's a little bit

1250
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,440
of crypto involved because at the very

1251
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,520
least you need to prove that the random

1252
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,760
selections necessary for auditing the

1253
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,920
uh for choosing the paper ballots

1254
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,319
have been done in uh have been done with

1255
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,000
integrity and are not predictable so

1256
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,800
here's uh ron rivest and philip stark

1257
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,760
tossing dice and inputting those dice

1258
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,000
into some codes for generating the

1259
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,520
pseudorandom permutation for selecting

1260
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,920
the bullets uh and so this is what turns

1261
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,800
the statistical process into a publicly

1262
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,720
verifiable process because now everybody

1263
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,240
else can see how ron rolled the dice and

1264
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
verify that they really are going and

1265
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,040
fishing out the ballots that they're

1266
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,560
supposed to not some kind of

1267
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,079
pre-programmed set of pellets that have

1268
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
been carefully chosen to not cheat

1269
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
okay so the last thing i want to talk

1270
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,599
about is end-to-end verifiable voting in

1271
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
a polling place which i actually think

1272
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,480
is

1273
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,800
probably the most interesting thing to

1274
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,720
do there's lots of different designs

1275
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,359
each reflecting the requirements of a

1276
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,040
different election system so on the left

1277
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,680
we have the v vote project from my home

1278
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,119
state of victoria which uses

1279
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,720
preferential voting you can see all the

1280
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
uh the preference numbers

1281
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,680
mashed into a protocol bullet

1282
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,880
on the right at the top we have the

1283
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,720
wombat voting system from israel which

1284
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,480
is just beautiful and very simple which

1285
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
i think reflects probably the the um

1286
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,920
very simple voting system uh that's in

1287
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,960
use there

1288
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,400
uh and down on the bottom right we have

1289
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,079
the scantigrity invisible ink system

1290
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,839
which unsurprisingly looks a lot like an

1291
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,599
american ballot because

1292
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,839
of um

1293
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,960
the

1294
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,240
the use

1295
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
in that and they use codes it's kind of

1296
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,040
a hybrid between code voting and uh

1297
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,119
challenge-based voting

1298
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,480
so there's lots of different designs

1299
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
interestingly enough

1300
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
neither the v-vote system nor the

1301
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
scantegrity system is still in use

1302
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,560
although they were both used in

1303
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,000
government elections and i think the

1304
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,920
wombat system is still being used but

1305
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,440
not in government elections so all of

1306
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,599
these things are they're really cool but

1307
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,240
they're not actually being run for

1308
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
electing governments

1309
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,359
i could be wrong about one bad i should

1310
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,520
double check

1311
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,560
so

1312
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,640
the most exciting thing that's happening

1313
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
which um

1314
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
i've been a little bit involved in um

1315
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,200
but mostly as an observer is josh

1316
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,240
benello's election guard thing in uh

1317
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,400
which is a complete

1318
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,000
open source

1319
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,880
kit

1320
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,760
for supporting

1321
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,960
end-to-end verifiable elections

1322
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,400
income in um concert with risk limiting

1323
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,280
audits so i actually think this this is

1324
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,440
the future of voting in my opinion

1325
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,359
and um

1326
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,280
if my abstract gave the impression that

1327
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,480
i didn't think the cryptographic

1328
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
solutions were

1329
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,280
of value that was absolutely not the

1330
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,960
impression i meant to give i think that

1331
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,520
this approach to combine the

1332
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,079
cryptographic solutions with the

1333
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,640
paper-based statistical auditing is

1334
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,000
absolutely

1335
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,839
the way to go and the the reason i think

1336
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,200
this is the way to go

1337
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,319
is that if it's well-designed you get a

1338
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,160
sort of disjunctive set of trust

1339
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,560
assumptions in other words the

1340
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,800
cryptographic evidence has some

1341
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,280
assumptions the statistical evidence has

1342
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,640
some assumptions specifically about the

1343
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,520
chain of custody of the paper ballots

1344
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,960
the thing that i really love about

1345
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,559
election guard is the way that it's

1346
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,319
designed to

1347
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,559
take advantage of both of them so you

1348
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,079
can either

1349
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,599
trust the statistical evidence

1350
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,200
associated with the paper ballots or you

1351
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,000
can trust the cryptographic evidence

1352
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,880
for

1353
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,960
the continuing

1354
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,760
proof that your ballot was included in

1355
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,920
the telly even after you walked away

1356
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,119
and i think the flexibility in the

1357
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,680
combination of those two things is just

1358
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,599
the right way to go

1359
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,920
so i think this will give us this will

1360
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,280
not give us voting over the internet

1361
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,640
because it doesn't solve any of the

1362
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,960
earlier things we talked about for that

1363
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,079
but this will give us very flexible and

1364
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,760
very

1365
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
high integrity voting

1366
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,359
in a polling place potentially you know

1367
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,720
in a polling place a bit further away

1368
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,800
from home or in a polling place a couple

1369
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,119
more weeks before the election or it

1370
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,839
will reduce the strain on the paper

1371
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,200
ballot custody assumption anyway

1372
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,640
so i think this is really cool

1373
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,800
uh i'm almost out of time so i'm going

1374
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
to summarize my favorite technical open

1375
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,119
problems

1376
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,880
so

1377
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
one of the issues with combining the

1378
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,400
cryptographic verification

1379
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,119
and the risk limiting audit ideas is

1380
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,559
that cryptographic verification

1381
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,920
particularly individual verification

1382
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,839
tends to be a thing that you do at the

1383
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,359
time right you can challenge your helios

1384
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,520
ballot at the time that you're voting

1385
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,319
but if you miss your chance and you

1386
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,839
realize after the election that it was

1387
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,760
actually super close you can't escalate

1388
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,079
in the way that you could with risk

1389
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,760
limiting audits

1390
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,119
you can go back and check that your

1391
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,880
cipher text is on the bulletin board but

1392
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
you can't necessarily check

1393
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,880
that you can't redo the check of whether

1394
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,400
or not that ciphertext reflected your

1395
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,240
intentions so here's an interesting

1396
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,280
little

1397
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,920
um puzzle is can you think of a form of

1398
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,440
cryptographic verification that can be

1399
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,880
escalated if the result is close

1400
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,079
a second thing that those athenian discs

1401
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,319
had that we don't have in our electronic

1402
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,280
systems is publicly verifiable privacy

1403
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,800
right they have public verifiable

1404
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,319
publicly verifiable we have publicly

1405
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,040
verifiable integrity but i can't

1406
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,960
actually see whether my electronic

1407
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,079
ballot

1408
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,800
is private or not i'm trusting usually

1409
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,200
i'm trusting a threshold of

1410
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,040
authorities who have the decryption key

1411
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,880
thirdly caster's intended verification

1412
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,000
is the hardest part because that's the

1413
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,319
part that an ordinary person has to do

1414
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,599
and it's probably going to be different

1415
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,920
in your country from what it is in every

1416
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,760
other country that has

1417
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,119
invented something because your

1418
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,319
elections are probably a little bit

1419
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,480
different from everybody else's

1420
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,160
on that note the carefully designed

1421
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,839
interventions to encourage people to do

1422
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,359
the verification carefully obviously

1423
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,280
have to be specific

1424
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,079
um my favorite

1425
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
puzzle at the moment is trying to do

1426
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,760
something like the hybrid paper and

1427
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,319
crypto schemes but for remote voting and

1428
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,520
trying to think about whether there's a

1429
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
nice way of

1430
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
getting the information on the plain

1431
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,000
paper ballot posted back but also

1432
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,200
using some cryptographic techniques to

1433
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,440
give people evidence of their vote

1434
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,839
having been properly counted when it

1435
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,119
arrived

1436
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,319
so again i think i wrote the wrong thing

1437
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,200
in my abstract i i sort of referred to

1438
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,640
what happened to the piece of paper but

1439
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,839
what i actually mean of course is what

1440
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,760
happens to the information

1441
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,800
uh the last thing that's really

1442
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,640
interesting is verifying that only

1443
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,119
eligible people voted without

1444
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,319
making the vital list completely public

1445
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,000
all right i am out of time so i'm going

1446
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,240
to skip my reality check and just this

1447
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,319
is my concluding slide okay so what can

1448
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,520
you do

1449
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,960
first of all you can find out what's

1450
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,800
wrong with your own electoral system and

1451
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
fix it before the election if you're not

1452
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,280
having an election right now then now is

1453
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,800
exactly the right time to find out a

1454
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,200
little bit about what's happening in

1455
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,119
your democracy and make suggestions for

1456
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,040
change before it gets too catastrophic

1457
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,280
one thing that i found reduces the heat

1458
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,400
a lot

1459
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,760
in every country where i've seen it

1460
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,440
happen is to get an agreement on

1461
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,960
requirements

1462
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,280
carefully written down in advance

1463
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,800
because then you can have a scientific

1464
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,319
discussion about whether a particular

1465
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,160
system meets the requirements rather

1466
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
than a kind of heated argument about

1467
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,400
whether the system is adequate according

1468
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,520
to what you think the requirements

1469
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,800
should be

1470
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,240
and finally

1471
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
i think

1472
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,119
on the theme of just teaching people to

1473
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,400
think

1474
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,280
in a bit more of a paranoid way

1475
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
persuade them that they need to build

1476
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,960
evidence into their electoral processes

1477
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
rather than just building the system so

1478
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,119
that everything kind of seems to be okay

1479
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,200
which i bet you will find is the sort of

1480
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,400
natural

1481
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,720
instinct of almost everybody who builds

1482
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,760
election systems

1483
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,200
encourage them to think that it's a good

1484
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,040
thing when they notice that something

1485
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,520
went wrong

1486
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,640
and on that note i will end and welcome

1487
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,118
discussion and questions

1488
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,359
thanks vanessa so if there are any

1489
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,720
questions um you could i see nobody

1490
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,480
typed any questions in the zulip or in

1491
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,559
chat you can type them in you can try to

1492
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,800
just jump in and talk or given there are

1493
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,720
many people you could also try to raise

1494
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,920
your hand

1495
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
and i'll call on you but i guess the

1496
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,319
first one can just jump in and unmute

1497
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,520
yourself and

1498
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,839
ask questions

1499
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,480
oh there's something in the chat uh by

1500
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,680
uh

1501
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,720
niels

1502
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,400
you wanna right

1503
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,720
yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely right um

1504
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,760
i think if we see one of the most

1505
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,960
important requirements the voting system

1506
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,800
should be so simple that almost

1507
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,720
everybody can understand it any use of

1508
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,400
crypto looks like magic to most people

1509
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
and that is not good no i 100 agree and

1510
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
indeed um

1511
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,839
in some ways i think the

1512
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,160
massive industry of snake oil around

1513
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,839
um

1514
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,359
internet voting blockchain voting etc

1515
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,359
is really because of exactly this issue

1516
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,200
right that that uh

1517
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
the difference between a thing that is

1518
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,359
actually sound

1519
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:30,640
a thing that is sound is

1520
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,319
indistinguishable from a thing that is

1521
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,880
complete rubbish to almost all normal

1522
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,000
voters uh and you're 100 right

1523
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,319
um

1524
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,760
i think that's part of the reason that

1525
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,440
the hybrid systems are really good

1526
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,960
because

1527
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,200
you

1528
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,760
um

1529
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,920
you can choose your trust assumption

1530
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,559
and uh you know if the crypto is

1531
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,079
unintelligible you can trust the paper

1532
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,359
and if you

1533
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,359
understand the crypto you can work with

1534
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,119
that or if you trust somebody who

1535
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,880
understands the crypto then you can work

1536
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,920
with that

1537
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,720
um but yes i look i agree i just i don't

1538
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,640
know how to do crypto that everybody

1539
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,200
understands

1540
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
vanessa i have a question that's vaguely

1541
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,359
related to this point um which is in

1542
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,040
your first part of the talk you talked

1543
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,920
about this issue of you know all these

1544
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,440
implementations are wrong even though

1545
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,359
the components are fine but they just

1546
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,119
implemented it in the wrong context to

1547
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,800
reveal the trap door

1548
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,880
that doesn't sound to me special

1549
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,119
specific to voting systems isn't it like

1550
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,960
a difficulty in any crypto employment

1551
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,920
yeah

1552
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,680
and this comment that you just discussed

1553
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,160
makes voting even harder possibly but

1554
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,720
it just absolutely and i think i think

1555
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,319
part of the i think you're absolutely

1556
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,559
right in some ways i think that on

1557
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,720
people

1558
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,680
there's a degree of trust in

1559
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,000
voting systems

1560
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,760
that isn't

1561
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,000
um

1562
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,119
isn't imposed on anything else right um

1563
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,960
everything has bugs right everything has

1564
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,880
bugs including voting systems and yet

1565
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,720
somehow people seem willing to trust

1566
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,640
voting systems

1567
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,000
even when they know that they actually

1568
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,440
have no independent way of checking it

1569
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,440
so your banking system you can kind of

1570
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,359
see if you've lost all your money your

1571
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,598
um

1572
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,359
but

1573
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,960
with voting

1574
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,760
there's no corresponding kind of basic

1575
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
double checking and no capacity to often

1576
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,960
no capacity to recover often no capacity

1577
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,720
even to naturally detect when there's

1578
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,319
been a problem so yeah i completely

1579
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,640
agree in some ways um

1580
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,160
what i was saying was exactly what you

1581
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,920
just said absolutely that then in fact

1582
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,680
every system has these bugs and yet

1583
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,960
somehow we seem willing to tolerate the

1584
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,960
possibility in systems that have just

1585
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,160
the strongest threat model you could

1586
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,799
possibly have

1587
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,040
oh to neil ferguson who said i just pen

1588
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,040
and paper yeah i so

1589
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,559
yes

1590
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,480
to a large extent i'd just been in favor

1591
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,920
today actually over in australia we

1592
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,640
almost exclusively pen and paper um i do

1593
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,200
think you get something out of you get a

1594
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,359
few things out of risk limiting audits

1595
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,720
because you can count you can just count

1596
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,040
faster right so in countries like the us

1597
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,960
where they're counting vast complicated

1598
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,119
things they can't count manually in

1599
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,040
practice so they have to they have to do

1600
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,040
something other than count everything by

1601
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,520
hand and and they can do that uh in that

1602
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
i think what the

1603
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,839
polling place

1604
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,160
end-to-end verifiable systems add on top

1605
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,880
of pen and paper is not having to trust

1606
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,960
the paper chain of custody

1607
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,359
but i completely agree that it should be

1608
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,119
an on top of

1609
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,400
rather than an instead of

1610
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,520
there's a comment from john kelsey in

1611
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,599
the chat

1612
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,480
um

1613
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,599
but if john or anyone else wants to ask

1614
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,319
uh in person life question that might be

1615
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,558
good

1616
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,839
i i might have some background noise

1617
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:18,960
if you can

1618
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,119
i i might have some background noise

1619
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,319
here so but all i was pointing out is

1620
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,000
for end-to-end systems they are

1621
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,280
optimized for making sure that if

1622
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,760
there's any fraud you you you have a

1623
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,680
good chance of detecting it

1624
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,599
that offers another angle of attack

1625
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,920
where my goal is just to discredit an

1626
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
election that's very close sort of do

1627
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,599
the equivalent of the attack on the

1628
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,359
naive coin flipping protocol where i

1629
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,680
abort the protocol if the if the coin

1630
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,680
flip's gonna go the wrong way

1631
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,359
right so if i just tamper with some

1632
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,119
machines so that me and some other

1633
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,200
people in on the attack

1634
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,680
get bad receipts then we decide whether

1635
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,280
or not to release that

1636
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,200
to discredit an election that we don't

1637
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,240
like

1638
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,839
and yeah niels i mean it's hard to

1639
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,839
imagine any powerful elected figure

1640
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,119
trying to undermine the outcome of an

1641
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,480
election

1642
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,280
yeah

1643
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,640
yep uh yeah again completely agree

1644
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,480
um

1645
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,559
and again i guess it depends what you

1646
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,920
how you respond to that

1647
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,240
um

1648
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,000
yeah i agree i agree that's a problem i

1649
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,280
don't have a good

1650
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,720
i don't have a good answer to that

1651
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,559
except again to say that uh if i was

1652
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,079
organizing it i'd make sure well

1653
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,319
although i mean to some extent the same

1654
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,920
is true for just about anything

1655
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,720
including plain paper right that um

1656
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,040
you can say

1657
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,680
whatever that you saw the

1658
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,559
um officials throwing the paper ballots

1659
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,920
in the trash or or something i don't

1660
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,680
know whether

1661
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,680
the end-to-end systems actually make

1662
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,799
this

1663
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,000
worse they definitely don't solve it

1664
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,319
um

1665
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,599
yeah it seems like a

1666
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,119
hard problem to me

1667
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,520
um vanessa there's a question in zulip

1668
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,599
um from carolyn how can voting be

1669
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,200
implemented in highly untrusted

1670
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
environments such as non-democratic

1671
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,359
countries is there a way crypto can

1672
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,200
offer a better security assumption in

1673
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,079
these environments for the citizens

1674
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,000
wow that's a really hard question

1675
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
i think

1676
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,119
i mean it relates a little bit to

1677
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,040
john's point about

1678
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,160
willful

1679
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,520
undermining of the

1680
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,040
perceived value of the election right

1681
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,839
um

1682
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,599
i think if the people running the

1683
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,200
election uh

1684
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,520
willfully trying to make it look as if

1685
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,359
it is badly run

1686
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,960
then i don't know that there's very much

1687
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,920
you can do unfortunately

1688
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,119
um

1689
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,440
because exactly like john just said the

1690
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,720
the purpose of all these um methods of

1691
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
checking is to have an opportunity to

1692
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,400
see whether it's been badly run but if

1693
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
the objective is to make it look like

1694
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,160
it's been badly run well we don't really

1695
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
have a defense against that

1696
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,559
um i wish i did have a solution to that

1697
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,640
problem but i don't think i don't know

1698
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,799
yeah there was a follow-up comment that

1699
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,119
that crypto would just add another layer

1700
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,359
of distrust in election due to lack of

1701
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,839
understanding of the math

1702
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,240
possibly so possibly yeah possibly an

1703
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,480
easier thing to dis possibly another

1704
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,640
thing to discredit yeah

1705
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,040
sadly

1706
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,480
do you want to ask your question

1707
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,280
or should i read it

1708
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,920
oh i asked it um yeah no i i think this

1709
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,520
is an interesting question i mean is

1710
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,319
there a way that you could

1711
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,160
maybe keep a ballot

1712
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,520
uh public so you know it's a well-formed

1713
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,319
kind of ballot but then anonymize

1714
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,079
the connection between

1715
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,799
a voter and then a particular plaintext

1716
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,119
ballot

1717
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,480
that i'm

1718
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,119
i haven't seen

1719
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,160
one

1720
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,520
in which there isn't a big trust

1721
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,400
assumption on the authorities

1722
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,720
for only

1723
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,680
back how's this

1724
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,359
you're back but you should repeat your

1725
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,759
entire comments

1726
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,160
oh dear i believe you've frozen again

1727
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,160
vanessa

1728
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,240
maybe unshare the screen and just talk

1729
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
this

1730
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,880
vanessa we can't hear you unfortunately

1731
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,640
i'm so glad this doesn't happen during

1732
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,279
the talk but

1733
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,659
[Music]

1734
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,280
well

1735
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,640
in the meantime i have a comment that

1736
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,480
just occurred to me it's a time of

1737
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,079
attack i haven't heard anybody mention

1738
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,200
before

1739
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,000
suppose some of the organizers of the

1740
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,920
collection would like to have the option

1741
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,240
of discrediting the election later so

1742
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,079
you run the election

1743
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:34,799
and

1744
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,119
part of the cryptographic systems

1745
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,359
we can verify them but if my goal is to

1746
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,520
discredit the election if i if the

1747
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,200
people with the key central keys or

1748
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,000
something like that do the wrong thing

1749
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,079
it provides in controversial proof of

1750
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,440
manipulations in the election

1751
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,440
that seems to be a different attack

1752
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,440
model

1753
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,400
that's the connection now

1754
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,480
i think you're back

1755
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,400
sorry about that

1756
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,920
uh so now you have to tell me what i

1757
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,200
missed

1758
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,880
yeah niels you want to repeat your

1759
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,280
attack yeah

1760
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,799
i just as part of the talk in the

1761
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,160
comments i came up with a new attack on

1762
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,440
the election system i never thought

1763
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,319
about

1764
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,760
suppose the people who organize the

1765
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,880
election

1766
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,720
want to have the option of discrediting

1767
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,640
an outcome they don't like

1768
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,039
yeah so with cryptographic systems they

1769
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,280
could

1770
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,520
misbehave later if they don't like the

1771
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,680
outcome they misbehave they provide

1772
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,119
incontrovertible proof that the election

1773
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,920
was defrauded

1774
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,920
and they can invalidate an outcome they

1775
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,400
don't like

1776
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,319
that would seem to be a separate attack

1777
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,680
that i have never had anybody look into

1778
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,799
yeah that's really interesting and your

1779
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,039
point is that uh if we're all voting in

1780
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,599
the with uh paper ballots and glasses or

1781
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,440
whatever then uh it's a lot harder for

1782
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,880
them to do that

1783
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,599
the paper ballots the fraud doesn't

1784
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,480
scale very well right i think one of the

1785
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,079
important ratios is how many people are

1786
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,760
in the conspiracy versus how many votes

1787
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,119
can you be fraud

1788
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,720
okay you're fast yep

1789
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,599
yep uh and how how easy how likely are

1790
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,960
you to get caught

1791
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,680
and

1792
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,079
the other part obviously the primary

1793
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,880
fraud is in photo roll photo suppression

1794
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,480
and role you know photo role

1795
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,920
manipulation and stuff like that it's

1796
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,160
not an accounting accounting is the easy

1797
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,399
part

1798
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,760
i don't know well we have why

1799
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,520
there's suppression here in america

1800
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,480
it's it's it is a yes primary goal of

1801
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,079
one of the main bodies

1802
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,839
yes yes that's true you do yeah whereas

1803
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,440
we have compulsory voting uh in

1804
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,839
australia so

1805
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,760
um back again back to the point that

1806
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,880
different democracies are different

1807
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,160
right i think that and i think different

1808
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,359
weak points are probably different

1809
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,640
depending on exactly what the rest of

1810
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,960
the set up is yeah

1811
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,559
uh but yes i agree with that the vote

1812
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,760
suppression in the united states is

1813
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,359
probably the worst thing uh you don't

1814
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,559
even need to bother fiddling with the

1815
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,760
numbers you're

1816
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,920
fiddling with the count given that uh

1817
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,839
such a large fraction of voters are so

1818
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:14,119
deliberately excluded pretty bad

1819
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,319
and we're over time but it's an

1820
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,839
interesting discussion so if somebody

1821
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,079
wants to add another comment or question

1822
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,799
uh we can do maybe one more before

1823
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,359
wrapping up

1824
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,839
there's been some comments on the chat

1825
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,799
but vanessa just to make sure i

1826
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,240
understood you correctly in your last

1827
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,000
slide you don't need to share it you

1828
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,520
said you know find out what they're

1829
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,319
doing in your country and fix it so by

1830
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,880
fix it your ideal fix would be

1831
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,440
like abandon the fully electronic thing

1832
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,839
and do a hybrid system that's your fix

1833
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,559
yeah

1834
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,640
yeah that's what i would do

1835
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,839
just just wanted to make

1836
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,680
sure i would put out that

1837
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,960
it is

1838
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,880
not without discussion that electronics

1839
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,039
in cryptography have any role to play in

1840
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,079
elections whatsoever

1841
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,640
yeah i think that's a very fair point i

1842
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,880
agree there are some countries in which

1843
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,160
um

1844
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,720
there just doesn't need to be a role for

1845
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,960
electronic stuff i think there are other

1846
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,200
countries in which manual counting of

1847
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,520
paper ballots is not feasible uh it's

1848
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,240
not really feasible in the united states

1849
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,839
um and you could say well just do risk

1850
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,200
limiting audits then and don't do any

1851
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,359
cryptography um

1852
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,039
and i think that's uh that's definitely

1853
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,280
a

1854
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,440
defensible

1855
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,119
position but then what you what you get

1856
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,599
on from the end-to-end verifiability

1857
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,280
stuff on top of the risk limiting audits

1858
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,400
is that you don't have to trust the

1859
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,680
people who looked after the paper

1860
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,359
nils you seem to be assuming this is an

1861
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,359
either-or situation

1862
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,200
and it's possible to have

1863
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,000
pen and paper ballots and end-to-end

1864
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,559
verifiability and risk living audits you

1865
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,799
can get the best of all

1866
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,319
i i think there are some very

1867
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,440
interesting

1868
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,200
ideas there and i haven't quite

1869
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,280
evaluated them but i worry greatly about

1870
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,119
this rush to oh we should apply

1871
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,200
cryptography and i greatly

1872
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,158
object to things like the icr using a

1873
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:19,679
helios system

1874
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,520
and and endorsing it with that

1875
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,880
i

1876
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,359
we we claim we make claims of security

1877
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,960
for pieces of computer software

1878
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,238
and i think that goes much too far some

1879
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:39,839
of us are old enough to remember when

1880
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,238
the ballots in iacr were cast by the

1881
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:43,839
postal system and i must say the

1882
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,600
international postal system has some

1883
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,600
unique failure modes

1884
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,560
yes we see this is done for reachability

1885
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,640
not for other things

1886
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,198
i completely understand but we could do

1887
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,080
that without endorsing a magic box of

1888
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,278
cryptographic formulas

1889
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,279
anyway let's not go into that discussion

1890
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,319
that's not but uh well i definitely

1891
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,439
wouldn't endorse that for government

1892
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,799
elections i hope that was clear from the

1893
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,319
talk in some ways the whole point of

1894
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,719
this uh analysis was to say i don't

1895
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,719
think that yeah internet voting for

1896
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,640
government elections is a good idea i

1897
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,238
think it's a really bad idea uh and i

1898
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,000
think it's been shown to fail over and

1899
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,120
over and over and over again

1900
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,960
this was obvious

1901
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,600
okay so thank you very much vanessa for

1902
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,319
a very interesting talk and discussion

1903
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,399
um we'll end the session here yeah thank

1904
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,198
you

1905
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,479
okay i'll hang it on the chat for the

1906
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,560
next few hours so anybody who would like

1907
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,799
to ask more questions or engage in more

1908
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,399
discussion is very welcoming yeah thanks

1909
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:49,120
for having me
