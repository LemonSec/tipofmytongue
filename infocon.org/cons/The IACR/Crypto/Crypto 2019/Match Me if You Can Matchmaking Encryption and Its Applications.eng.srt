1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,120
thank you for the introduction so this

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,860
is a joint work we just epidemia

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,480
sedimentary and I'm gonna introduce much

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,109
mega encryption this new type of

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,000
encryption scheme and before C in the

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,430
scheme let's start with an analogy with

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,580
the real world so let's talk about a

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,759
life drop and he also have seen this

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,028
technique in movies and allows basically

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,170
spies to share signal information

11
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:37,550
supposedly it's an organization composed

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,899
by people their identities are secret

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,849
but the only thing that you know it's

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,729
their job so there are detective spies

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,129
ninja and so and so far so let's assume

16
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,079
now that there is a detective that needs

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,149
to give a top secret information to the

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,670
ninja so a way to do that is it live

19
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,550
drop they choose our public place they

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,139
meet there so the exactly knows that

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,638
he's looking for a ninja and the ninja

22
00:00:57,139 --> 00:01:00,530
is looking for a detection when they

23
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:03,190
meet basically the didactic can give

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,130
this a top secret information to the

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,798
other part so it's called life because

26
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,589
both party needs to interact and at the

27
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,610
same time and from a cryptography point

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,250
of view there is a scheme that

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,990
implements a such such a light drop that

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,359
is called secure than shake it's our key

31
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,880
exchange protocol there is an authority

32
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,939
that is basically responsible to

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,740
generates keys for the parties and the

34
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,658
keys contains the attributes of the

35
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,490
corresponding party so for example the

36
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,770
detective has the key for the adaboost

37
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,030
detective that's what that already does

38
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:40,340
and then the protocol Stan can start so

39
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,500
for example the attacker choose a policy

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,179
on the fly and the policy is a

41
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,259
description that the attributes of the

42
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:50,030
party must satisfy so the the party does

43
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,320
some pretty horrific operation reusing

44
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,049
the key and the policy and send a

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,048
message to the other party the other

46
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,820
party does the same send back the

47
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,890
message and the properties that they

48
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,729
share a secure Channel is both policy

49
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,799
are satisfied so there is a model match

50
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,389
signature some properties that the state

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,369
for the the

52
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,130
the intuitive one is the impersonator

53
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,760
resistant that basically says that it's

54
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,740
impossible to impersonate another person

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,660
so if I'm a minge and I have the

56
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,890
attributes for ninja I cannot pretend to

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,990
be a detective because I need the

58
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,510
corresponding key for the attributes and

59
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,120
the second one is called the tech toe

60
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,000
resistant that is ass or what a privacy

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,700
guarantee so suppose that the protocol

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,680
fails so at least one of the true policy

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,480
has not been satisfied then it's

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,600
impossible to do then mean which of the

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,459
true and this gives privacy guarantees

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,410
because if I choose the policy ninja I

67
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,850
cannot say that the other parties

68
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,290
unhinge or no because I don't know if my

69
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,910
policies satisfied so there is another

70
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,489
technique that was used that is called

71
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,829
that drop and basically it's a

72
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,660
non-interactive live drop so now instead

73
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,480
of a public place there is our secret

74
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,910
spot that both party knows so the

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,590
directly goes there sees the rock that

76
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,240
they also the other party knows and put

77
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,850
the top secret information on the diss

78
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,040
rock and then leaves so at some point

79
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:18,019
the ninja will come sister rock and

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,510
takes back the top secret information so

81
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,140
a cryptographic scheme that implements

82
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,880
at that drop must be seen as

83
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,529
non-interactive secret handshake so an

84
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,260
encryption scheme that has the same

85
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,110
property of signalling shake and this is

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,720
what it is a matchmaking encryption so

87
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,760
the level there is an authority again

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,769
that generates the keys for the party

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,540
that contains the attributes but it's

90
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,760
also responsible to generate an

91
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,000
additional decryption key that contains

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,190
the policy of the receiver and then the

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,230
sender can encrypt by choosing a policy

94
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,489
on the fly using the encryption key for

95
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,459
his attributes the policy and the

96
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:59,239
message produces ciphertext and the

97
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,430
receiver can decrypt by using the keys

98
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,739
so the kiss for that was the key for the

99
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,780
policy and the probably is the usual one

100
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,640
so if there is a mood of match so both

101
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,269
are satisfied then the receiver can

102
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,040
retrieve the message that level the

103
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,380
algorithms are the following there is

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,149
the setup algorithm that generates the

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,649
master public key the master secret key

106
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,560
and the master series used by the

107
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,919
authority to generate the keys then

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,750
there are

109
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,030
Shuki gen algorithm one is for the

110
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,740
sender so it's responsible to generate

111
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,349
the encryption key for the attributes

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,700
for the underside and there is the one

113
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,200
for the receiver that generates the

114
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,659
decryption key for the attitudes of the

115
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,360
receiver there is the third algorithm to

116
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,280
generate key the key for the policy so

117
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,720
the decryption key contains the policy

118
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,400
and then there is the standard

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,920
encryption decryption algorithm so the

120
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,539
first one takes the encryption key for

121
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,170
the attributes the policy undefined a

122
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,510
message and produces ciphertext and the

123
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,490
decryption takes the two keys so one for

124
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,830
the artist one for the policy the cipher

125
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,830
to retrieve and returns either the

126
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,419
message or an error so as I told you

127
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,550
much my encryption is unknown

128
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,220
Interactive secured a shake so must

129
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,910
guarantee the same probability that

130
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,700
cigarette shake has for this reason we

131
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,950
define true game based definition for to

132
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,650
capture these properties the first one

133
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,659
is called match security and

134
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,880
incorporates at the same time the CPA

135
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,890
security of the encryption scheme

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,080
together with the Tac Toe resistant so

137
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,599
here the attacker is the send the

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,940
receiver as Oracle access to the keygen

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,210
algorithms and during the game at some

140
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,280
point produces two challenges and each

141
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,570
challenge contain dips the input of the

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,150
encryption algorithm so the attributes

143
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:47,210
the policy and the message of the sender

144
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,520
the Challenger choosing one of the two

145
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,489
encrypts it and the objectives to get

146
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,039
the bid way so it's clear that this is a

147
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,930
CPA security definition because the day

148
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,270
received so the attacker can choose two

149
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,970
messages and also as Oracle access to

150
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,890
the center keygen so can ask for

151
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,210
encryption key and generates the

152
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,300
corresponding ciphertext

153
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,859
but notice that basically the attacker

154
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,810
can choose everything so can choose the

155
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,940
attributes of the sender the policy and

156
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,210
also they the policy and the attitudes

157
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,740
of the receiver by making Oracle queries

158
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:24,469
to the keygen algorithms so we have a

159
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:28,160
definition of valid adversary and what

160
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,810
basically says that since the bursar you

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,460
can choose everything can produce a

162
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,860
match or mismatch and if produce if they

163
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:40,030
Tucker produces our mismatch what we ask

164
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,520
is that basically both challenge lies in

165
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,739
one of this cartel each channel lies on

166
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,450
this category one of these categories so

167
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,830
it's a mismatch and note that the

168
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,170
doesn't they don't need to be on the

169
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,000
same class that for example the first

170
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,890
challenge will be a mismatch of this

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,020
type while the second one of this type

172
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,580
and this implies that we have detector

173
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,260
resistant because we're implicitly say

174
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,219
that these cases are indistinguishable

175
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,620
and in the definition is also an

176
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,050
additional case that the case where the

177
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,260
attacker has a match so it can actually

178
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,900
retrieve the messages the message so we

179
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,320
ask the attacker to put true message

180
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,620
that are even in the challenge face so

181
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,360
this definition is the Capitol's the CPA

182
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,160
security definition and the declare

183
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,350
system but we are still missing the

184
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,470
impersonator resistant so we have a

185
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,180
second definition that is called NTC now

186
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,280
the tackle is the sender has horrible

187
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,530
access to the keygen algorithm and what

188
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,869
the tackle needs to do is to produce a

189
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,210
ciphertext that correctly the creeps

190
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,970
under policy and without having the

191
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,409
corresponding key so with our via keye

192
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:53,110
for some multiples that match the policy

193
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,820
so which may include has policies has

194
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,500
attributes so the first question is what

195
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,730
is the relation with database encryption

196
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,470
so there are many mainly two what would

197
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,170
be different of the first one is called

198
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,390
suffered policy so where the sender I

199
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,250
used the policy it just our policy on

200
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,289
the fly and then creeps the message and

201
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,660
the decryption key of the receiver

202
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,430
contains the attributes and there is the

203
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,980
opposite that is called key policy now

204
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,190
they send their chooses the attributes

205
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,940
on the fly and the decryption key

206
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,830
contains the policy so much my

207
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,450
encryption implies cyber policy B

208
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,099
because the only thing that we have to

209
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,960
do is to ignore the policy of the

210
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,390
receiver and this can be done by setting

211
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,510
the policy to a tautology so a formula

212
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,900
that is always satisfied and the match

213
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,740
very encryption also implies key policy

214
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,300
B if you don't need NTC D because first

215
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,990
of all we can ignore the policy of the

216
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,579
sender using this

217
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,900
technique but few hours you can see

218
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,300
there is a me this is a difference

219
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,150
because the the sender has an encryption

220
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,920
key for the attributes why this is why

221
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,500
they we need an encryption key because

222
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,030
we want identity but of course if we

223
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,460
don't me that NTC these attributes can

224
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:07,480
be chosen on the fly and we have

225
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,250
keyboards IP there is a third case third

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,340
type of attribute based encryption is

227
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,100
called wall policy now there are two

228
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,660
policies and the one of the receiver is

229
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,500
containing the decryption key together

230
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,270
with the attributes and in this case the

231
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,520
true schemes remains incomparable

232
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,110
because they main difference that the

233
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,960
well-polished a single key while much

234
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,270
mental fracture and the image file

235
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,190
encryption if the receiver has multiple

236
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,770
keys can interleave them and this is not

237
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,780
possible in door policy and moreover if

238
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,630
you didn't care about the the decryption

239
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,280
key that the the problem of drug

240
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,230
policies that doesn't achieve much

241
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:51,100
security because it's always possible to

242
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:52,780
see if a policy satisfy or not so now we

243
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,690
are going to see how we can build much

244
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,579
many encryption and higher level this is

245
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,500
what is the workflow of the decryption

246
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,650
algorithm so as to check if both

247
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,640
policies satisfy if it is true generator

248
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,990
the message of device on an error so the

249
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,280
first question is why we don't build

250
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,750
much way in kill shop for attribute

251
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,550
based encryption because we have

252
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,850
suffered policy and key policy maybe we

253
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,290
can use both to have much Maggie and

254
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,030
let's forget for the moment about this

255
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,520
it is all so let's assume that we want a

256
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,500
much more encryption scheme that

257
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,990
attributes are choosing on-the-fly a way

258
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,820
to do that is to encrypt use a key

259
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,580
policy ABI to first encrypt the message

260
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,770
and then encrypt the again the

261
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,200
ciphertext with the cyber policy ABI

262
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,370
so now we have to decryption keys one

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,770
for the attributes that is the

264
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,990
decryption key of cyber policy B so we

265
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,790
can remove the layer on the crypts on

266
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,500
faith and we can use the second key what

267
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,770
they were for the policy to remove the

268
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,990
last layer and retrieve the message so

269
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,449
from a simple article a synthetical

270
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,950
point of view this looks like how much

271
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,320
my encryption scheme but the promise

272
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,140
that doesn't achieve much security and

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,730
they gave you the intuition before

274
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,510
because basically any nothing

275
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,490
encryption scheme is responsible only to

276
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,500
handle a single policy and what that

277
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,690
policy is not satisfied basically

278
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,170
returns an error message so there are

279
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,209
methods the the information that the

280
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,920
police is not satisfied so in this

281
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,680
example basically when we tried to for

282
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,449
example to decrypt the first layer we

283
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,069
retrieve the method error message we

284
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:28,899
know that the policies not satisfied and

285
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:31,510
been in details these two cases so the

286
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,130
one that the policy of the sender is not

287
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,689
satisfying the one of the receiver yes

288
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,000
and the opposite are always

289
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:41,019
distinguishable and these are two cases

290
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,540
of the match the security definition so

291
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,760
this give us the intuition that in order

292
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,649
to have matchmaking to implement much

293
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,959
more encryption we need to check that

294
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:52,180
both policies are satisfied tonically

295
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,869
otherwise it's impossible to have as

296
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,519
much security and from the vanilla point

297
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,139
of view we have two results we were able

298
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,810
to build a much more encryption from

299
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,029
randomized functional encryptions engine

300
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,849
or interacted zero knowledge we have a

301
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,350
second results where we replace the

302
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,420
randomized function encryption scheme

303
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,610
with a two input for a functional

304
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,529
encryption so we can trade the

305
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,790
randomization of the function with a two

306
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:21,310
input function so let's see the the

307
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,149
first result what is a functional

308
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,130
encryption scheme

309
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:26,110
there are decryption key for functions

310
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,380
is it possible to encrypt a message

311
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,850
using a public key and the properties

312
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,560
that when we decrypt using the

313
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,569
decryption key what we obtain is the

314
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,388
valuation of the function we didn't put

315
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:38,949
the encrypted message and the guarantee

316
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,920
the security guarantees that nothing is

317
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:43,750
leaked except the output of the function

318
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,449
there is the randomized version

319
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,040
basically the same were the

320
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,839
functionalities randomized so when we

321
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,290
decrypt usually we evaluate the function

322
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,940
with some fresh anonymous so how we

323
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,920
build much more encryption we use two

324
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,220
functions one is randomized why miss

325
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,349
deterministic the randomized one has are

326
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,269
coded the attributes of the receiver and

327
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,010
takes in input the attributes of the

328
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:09,640
send that the policy and the message and

329
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,589
this function checks they say if the

330
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,819
policy studies if the sender policy is

331
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:17,240
satisfied

332
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:21,530
this is true Riaan Clips the attributes

333
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,180
of the the sender and the message using

334
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,600
the encryption the encryption algorithm

335
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,599
functional encryption otherwise

336
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,880
re-encrypt encrypts to error messages

337
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,310
using the same encryption algorithm then

338
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,710
we have a second function that as I call

339
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,270
it now the Polish of the receiver takes

340
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,400
an input the attributes of the sender

341
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,920
and the message so what the previous

342
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,260
function encrypt and thus the N checks

343
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,420
them but they decide if the policy of

344
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,069
disability satisfied if it is true

345
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,530
return the message otherwise the darn

346
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,650
error so basically what we are doing

347
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,400
here is we are using two different

348
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:01,730
function to check the true policies and

349
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,410
we are were pass information to the

350
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,210
second fashion encrypted fashion in

351
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,280
order to don't leak an information and

352
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,310
this allows to check both policy in

353
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,900
atomic way so just to conclude basically

354
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,939
the decryption key for data bus will be

355
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,220
the decryption key foe of the randomized

356
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,990
function encryption scheme and the

357
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,280
decryption key of the policy will be the

358
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,760
decryption key of function of the

359
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,220
function encryption scheme so these

360
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,270
construction as it is allows us to have

361
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:32,270
match security but still we miss

362
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:35,030
authenticity and how we keep that is we

363
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,600
use a signature interacted

364
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,319
zero-knowledge

365
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,880
at eye level basically the signature is

366
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,430
used by the authorities to certify that

367
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,590
the party has the process that

368
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,390
attributes so the signature will be the

369
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,220
encryption key and then we use known

370
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,500
interacted zero knowledge to prove that

371
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,930
the attributes that are encrypting here

372
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,850
are attributes that the party possess so

373
00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:01,040
in other signature that correct bellezza

374
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,960
verifies under these attributes and what

375
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,640
we need zero knowledge because we need

376
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,680
to only can information about the

377
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,830
attributes because otherwise an

378
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,489
information about that was can give us

379
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:19,070
the carry belief a policy satisfied no

380
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:20,810
so we don't have much security so I'll

381
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,400
mention some of the results that way you

382
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,920
can find out the paper we have an

383
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,620
implementation of an identity based

384
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,630
version so basically attribute

385
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,180
some policies are binary string and the

386
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,880
policy satisfies these choose strings

387
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,660
are equal we put forward with with the

388
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,670
final definitions and were able to build

389
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,529
this identity based version from the

390
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:47,240
Berliner the fear my assumption there

391
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:49,010
are no more core then we we implemented

392
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,290
an anonymous bulletin board that use

393
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,589
identity based much money encryption to

394
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,930
allows parties to posterity messages

395
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,690
accorded to the entities and productive

396
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:03,979
privacy used by the match security

397
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:07,010
definition the match property and lastly

398
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,710
we have a an alternative version of much

399
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,839
money encryption where now instead of

400
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,790
heavy chookies we have a single kid that

401
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,640
incorporates together the attributes and

402
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,160
the policy like in world policy be and

403
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,350
still we have the magical definition

404
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,170
with the identity definition and in this

405
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,610
case we are able to be the scheme from

406
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,779
directly from functional encryption as

407
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,920
in even know interact it's your

408
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:33,500
knowledge so you can find the detail on

409
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,610
the the paper on the full version and

410
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:42,470
that's it so thank you and happy to us

411
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:45,030
[Applause]

412
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,250
if you have a question please come to

413
00:16:45,030 --> 00:17:00,120
the microphone we have a lot of time for

414
00:16:47,250 --> 00:17:01,650
questions already cut encryption it's

415
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,180
their functional encryption would it be

416
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,730
sufficient or do you need it seems like

417
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,220
you only need security in the case where

418
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:17,220
things don't decrypt which is usually

419
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:19,170
much easier well the problem is that we

420
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,620
need to policy so we will need to

421
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:26,459
predicate encryption right and the

422
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:28,620
problem is that how you how you merge

423
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,750
these two schemes because if you using

424
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,219
naive way like we use a two bit

425
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,770
encryption we don't you don't have a

426
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,450
match security that's the problem so you

427
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:41,010
need like animal like a proper of the

428
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,690
true scheme that doesn't leak any

429
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,379
information about the predicate that's

430
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:57,990
the problem so I don't think it's

431
00:17:46,380 --> 00:18:01,970
sufficient more questions so I have a

432
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,290
question do you have any intuition

433
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,750
whether we can prove that it is

434
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,080
impossible to achieve much making

435
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:15,750
encryption from attribute based

436
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:18,270
encryption in the blackbox way or we

437
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,980
don't have such result I mean it's an

438
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:25,920
intuition ok if you don't assume any

439
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,440
additional assumption so any altered

440
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,970
scheme on an additional sample the

441
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,140
intuition is that is not possible

442
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,600
because it's hard to come by the true

443
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,080
schemes that's the end have much

444
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,060
security I mean I don't have been

445
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
possibility result but that's just an

446
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,149
intuition ok thanks

447
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,150
more questions

448
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,039
yeah let's thank speak again

449
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
[Applause]
