1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,930
so this talk is about Sika sharing in

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,820
particular about the trash of sigma

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,769
sharing so let's define them so a secret

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,320
sharing is an object that allows to take

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:21,480
a silicate message and share it so you

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:25,570
get and shares as one to ascend it the

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,690
two most important property of such a

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:33,280
tool are roller coaster action meaning

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,660
that every set of row shirts can join

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,950
together and reconstruct the original

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:42,550
message and then tao privacy the privacy

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,469
means that any set of tile -1 parties if

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,690
the John together they have no clue of

14
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,969
what the second message is so those are

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,489
the two basic property so we consider

16
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,829
this thing called tau raw and treasured

17
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,379
signal sharing and of course the optimal

18
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:59,680
thing is when tau is equal to Rho this

19
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,809
is usually called add a tower out of n

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,579
Sigma sharing but of course also the

21
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,289
setting in which tau is literally

22
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,090
smaller the row makes sense

23
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:09,670
and this is sometimes called the

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,490
electorate electorate or as a ramp

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,920
secret sharing so of course there are

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,890
twist is to property but we can think

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,470
also about also new property and there

28
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,679
is this very nice work about

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,720
by Google and Kumar last year a stock

30
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:27,580
and then traded this notion called the

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,380
normal ability so what is a non

32
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,380
malleable signal sharing so imagine this

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,899
attack scenario in which we shared our

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,300
secret message we get the share then

35
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:38,800
adversary calm that versary decide our

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,170
tampering function and our

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,450
reconstruction set T and the tampering

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,819
function is applied to the shirts so you

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,759
create some tamper shirts and then that

40
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,470
West sorry get to see the reconstruction

41
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,349
of the tamper shirt so you get to see

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,810
this hundred message and now the normal

43
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:59,050
ability properties say that the privacy

44
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,030
of the original message is is maintained

45
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,420
even if that versary get to see this

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,670
Mollett message of course we need to put

47
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,429
some restriction so the first place

48
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,780
region is that that vestry cannot send

49
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,700
identity function so when the identity

50
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,110
function happens so of course that

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,030
equation will give you the original

52
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,640
message and then the privates cannot be

53
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,710
cannot hold and in this case

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,420
we see that say to diversity look I

55
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,640
cannot tell you the message the message

56
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,070
is the same up before I mean it's the

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,709
challenge message I cannot tell you that

58
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,989
of course then there is another case so

59
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,760
maybe an adversary can come and send

60
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,520
this a tampering function which

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,739
reconstruct the shirts add +1 and then

62
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,870
we share now that a constructive message

63
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,390
would be the message plus 1 and this of

64
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,820
course is something that again break the

65
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,470
privacy of the original message and in

66
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,880
this case we need to do something here

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:55,359
and what we do is to limit the class of

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,510
tampering that that an adversary can can

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,760
do so there are many way to limit this

70
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,679
kind of class of tampering in this work

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,870
we're gonna consider the individual

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,540
tampering model in this individual

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,410
tampering model what we do is that the

74
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,660
tampering function is a divided in n

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,880
tampering function so each fan tampering

76
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,959
function will act to one show in one to

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,970
one sure so ok so what are our

78
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,370
contribution our contribution are the

79
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:29,380
following so assuming 1 2 1 1 we

80
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,120
function we get and no malleable secret

81
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,769
ceiling with the following property I'm

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,480
bout that polynomially many tampering

83
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,870
security which means that if you look at

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,340
the at the converse area with of the

85
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,840
security experiment of before the

86
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,120
security experiment of before it was a

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,370
one-time experiment but of course you

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,450
can not only generalize the experiment

89
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,130
in a more in a many many time tampering

90
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,660
and in this many many in time tampering

91
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,090
would happen is that adversary can

92
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,220
tamper function you get to see a message

93
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,540
then it can descend yet another também

94
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,450
function and then you get to see the

95
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,870
messenger and again and again so we get

96
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,790
unbounded tampering this is unbounded

97
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,310
ability some time called the continuous

98
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,560
normal ability then we have the property

99
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,358
or adaptive calm current record stretch

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,358
and adaptive concrete reconstructionist

101
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,089
the following property so as I said the

102
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,890
adversary can send a tamper function but

103
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,469
they actually you can have to select the

104
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,479
the reconstruction set and now we can

105
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,400
allow the adversary to select the

106
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,360
reconstruction set adaptively

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,789
and then our scheme is at so noisy

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,710
leakage resident so that vessel can leak

109
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,340
partial information about the shirts and

110
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,520
then the rate of our scheme is 1 so the

111
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,770
rate is the ratio between the between

112
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,210
the message and the maximum sharing this

113
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:55,219
is equal to 1 okay so this is the rated

114
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,560
works unfaltering I don't have time to

115
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,110
go through all the Rove of this table so

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,710
let's just consent concentrate ourself

117
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:06,140
to the last row or our paper so we have

118
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,049
a lot of nice nice property as you can

119
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,940
see and the only difference the only

120
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,130
thing that distinguish us from the

121
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,080
related works is that we need to assume

122
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,490
one-way function while all the other

123
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,599
work are in the information theoretic

124
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:26,720
setting if you think about it actually

125
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:28,280
this thing the part the point is that we

126
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,530
need to assume one-way function because

127
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,719
one-way functions are necessary to get

128
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,729
continuous normal ability at least there

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,790
are necessary when tau is equal to Rho

130
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,350
of course we have a Tau which is smaller

131
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,270
than Rho but there is a kind of an

132
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,100
indication that is very hard to do this

133
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,729
kind of thing without computational

134
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,650
assumption so to go back to the

135
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,170
definition in the finishin i say that

136
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,120
the adversity can tamper many many times

137
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,100
but at some time at some point maybe

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,090
that vs. and a tampering function and

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,800
the standard in function is too bad and

140
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,570
then there is no message that can be

141
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,540
reconstructed and in this case the

142
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,670
reconstruction say look error I cannot I

143
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,450
cannot say what message was inside of

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,510
this shirt and in this case we need to

145
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,219
cut the Oracle access to that versus oh

146
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,750
we need to start this threat what we

147
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,640
need to do that because otherwise there

148
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,560
will be an impossibility result so it's

149
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,770
not possible to do a continuation of

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:30,260
malleability without self-destruct again

151
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,030
so we are we also want to have leakage

152
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,530
resilient and so the kind of leakage

153
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,080
residence that we consider it's called

154
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,500
the noisy leakage model in this noisy

155
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,789
leakage mandible the adversary can leak

156
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,010
partial information about the share and

157
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,290
the only restriction on the

158
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,630
on the function that you can send is de

159
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,030
for lowing so the only restriction is on

160
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,670
the average conditional mid entropy of

161
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,830
the shares given the leakage this thing

162
00:06:52,670 --> 00:07:01,790
has to be either enough so let's go to

163
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,940
our construction I'm gonna show you our

164
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:08,120
construction with portrait so we want to

165
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,010
do a tea out of an secret shading let's

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,570
start with the simplest case so the

167
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,750
simplest cases are two out of two

168
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,430
continuously normally bicycle sharing so

169
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,840
when we want to do this thing and

170
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,760
actually they already exist so after 12

171
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,070
to continuously nama bicycle sharing is

172
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,930
just a continuously no malleable code in

173
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,000
the speed state model so we know already

174
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,310
how to do them we know we can do them

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,530
from one way function this is this work

176
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,320
of Ostrosky per channel venturi a

177
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,130
Visconti of last year here a crypto so

178
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,320
we have them so the technical part or

179
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,360
the technical contribution of this work

180
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,370
is the following we start with that to

181
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,950
add of to continues minimum basic a

182
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,990
shilling and we obtain a tau tau minus

183
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,320
one and continuously no malleable

184
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,860
situation so if you want so this is the

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:02,599
take home of of this paper from the

186
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,990
technical part so let's let's try to do

187
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,780
them

188
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,510
so let's warm up with an example let's

189
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,700
start to do a two out of two at what of

190
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,700
n continues you know Mabel secret

191
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,130
sharing using a 12 to continuously

192
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,900
nominal secret sharing so what we do so

193
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,540
let's look at this matrix so in this

194
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,859
Malick's each column is a share now it's

195
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,190
empty and then it's each row is will be

196
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,810
indexed by a couple of indexes and we're

197
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,900
going to compute this matrix so what we

198
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,150
do is we do a fresh share of the message

199
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,220
that we want to share and then there is

200
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,289
the first index the in the first index

201
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,030
would be one two and we put the share

202
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,189
one in position one the sure to in

203
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,949
position two then there is one three so

204
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,480
share one position one shed in position

205
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,960
three and so on and so on and we

206
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,330
continue to fill all this matrix now if

207
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,560
we want to reconstruct

208
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,810
suppose the one trick was tracked using

209
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,660
the index two three where

210
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,359
easily so two three they define our role

211
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,520
industry matrix so we go to this row we

212
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,100
pick these two shirts and now with the

213
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:12,199
construct them easy it's really easy to

214
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,810
show that this thing is continuously

215
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,970
know and know malleable basically

216
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,050
suggests an ibid argument over all the

217
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,970
role of of this matrix but it's easy but

218
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,270
not super trivial in fact are ready for

219
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:31,910
this case we need to assume a property

220
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:33,949
from the inner property from the from

221
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:39,199
the inner two out of two continuously no

222
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:40,520
mumble secret shading so what is the

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,550
point of this light the point of this

224
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,730
life is to show a very basic principle

225
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,589
of secure sharing in general so if you

226
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,150
have two secret sharing let's say that

227
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,130
one single sharing as an Access

228
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,620
structural equal to a the other

229
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,660
suggesting as an attestation equal to a

230
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,240
prime if we do this composition of

231
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,600
sticking together the roof then you get

232
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,720
another Sigma sharing with access

233
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,080
structure equal to a union a prime this

234
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,980
is a very basic principle although you

235
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,640
can agree on this so keep in mind this

236
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,640
this thing

237
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,640
so let's now give another Sigma sharing

238
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,370
this trigga sharing is going to have a

239
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,140
weird access structure let's look at it

240
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,510
so we're gonna call it this thing the

241
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,520
building block secret sharing so the

242
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,589
building block secret sharing will be we

243
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,470
will do the following thing so we sample

244
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:40,490
a key then we share the key and we get

245
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,620
to share as one as two then we use this

246
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,260
key and the message to create an

247
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,660
authenticated the ciphertext C and then

248
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,720
we do Shamir's secret sharing of the

249
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,550
ciphertext now the the value of tau for

250
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,839
the symmetrical sharing will be said to

251
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,370
be tau minus two and I kind of can't

252
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,140
convince you that this thing is

253
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,380
continuously not malleable

254
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,959
the da's that so the the key is well

255
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,670
protected because a is using a

256
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,760
continuously no malleable signal sharing

257
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,620
so the key is not in the view

258
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,090
the adversary and now that versed you

259
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,560
get to see a ciphertext but this is

260
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,120
another dedicated safe attack so it

261
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,369
cannot manipulate it in any in in any

262
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,790
way and then we use Shamir to get

263
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:30,760
privacy out of this scheme so now what

264
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:32,920
is the access structure of this of the

265
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,080
of this building block lexical sharing

266
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,010
so the access structure is the the

267
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,880
accessed actor a 1 2 which is equal to

268
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,860
the oldest set of cardinality at least

269
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:56,020
Tao which contained index 1 and 2 ok I

270
00:11:47,860 --> 00:12:00,550
think I'm going very fast so let's see

271
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:04,569
how to do Tao out of an secret sharing

272
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:08,250
to do that so we basically do the

273
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:11,760
composition of before so we sample a

274
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,860
secret sharing using the building block

275
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,290
secret sharing and so we get to share

276
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,150
for the key we put here the first year

277
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,030
we put here the second share

278
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:26,170
and this is the symmetrical sharing then

279
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:28,660
we do it again but now we permute the

280
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,410
the index where they with the so this is

281
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,290
the fresh secret sharing we permute the

282
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,569
index of of where we shared the key so

283
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:42,520
the key will be shared in the index 1 &

284
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:47,320
2 & then we continue with this with this

285
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:50,800
procedure until to fix until to complete

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:54,730
all the all the matrix so now what is

287
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,240
the access structure of this secret

288
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:02,140
sharing so the the access structure of

289
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,020
each row is equal to a 1 2 2 3 and so on

290
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,290
so the access structor in total will be

291
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,260
the union of all the abstractor and if

292
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,209
you do just if you look at this thing

293
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,980
you will notice that the access

294
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,770
structure of this secure sharing is

295
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,910
actually the Tao out of an abstract or

296
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,030
data we are looking for so this input so

297
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,089
you will think

298
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,100
okay let's proceed as before let's do an

299
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,500
a/b the argument over I showed you that

300
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,530
each component is continuously not

301
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,390
malleable let's try to do a an ibid

302
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,520
argument over all the possible row it

303
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,170
seem that this thing would give us a

304
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,970
continuously no malleable secret sharing

305
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,760
but actually there is a problem

306
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,560
okay sorry guys I didn't tell you how to

307
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,500
reconstruct so how would you reconstruct

308
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,130
so to reconstruct let's suppose everyone

309
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,310
reconstruct using the index one two

310
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:58,700
three and then so what you do so you

311
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:02,780
pick the minimum indexes in the set so

312
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,360
this one and two then you go to the row

313
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,920
one and show now you can do the

314
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,290
reconstruction of this key the

315
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,650
reconstruction of the ciphertext in the

316
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:16,459
crypt so this is the way we do

317
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:20,680
reconstruction and so as I said before

318
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,680
there is a problem the problem is that

319
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,689
so I will show you the problem so

320
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,900
suppose that that versary want to

321
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:33,080
reconstruct using 1 2 3 and then so now

322
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:36,110
suppose that the in my lab temperately

323
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:40,580
sure and actually can tamper this sure

324
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:43,400
it can transfer information from this

325
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,170
part of the share over here so it can

326
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,970
really transfer a lot of information and

327
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,740
at point is because the reconstruction

328
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,540
here is a linear function so you can

329
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,450
really lick a lot of information about

330
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,760
this sure here so we cannot proceed with

331
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,070
the hybrid argument because we wanted to

332
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,710
resource to the continuously no

333
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,280
malleable property of these two shirts

334
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:08,150
but here there is some leakage so we

335
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,579
cannot do that so what is this is

336
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,140
solution the first is resolution is you

337
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,230
know let's assume that this secret

338
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,730
sharing is leakage or a sealant now it's

339
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,890
leakage resilient yeah there is some

340
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,530
leakage is simplest thing to solve the

341
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,310
thing but the problem is that this will

342
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,500
only solve the problem partially because

343
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,079
we can resort to leakage resilient only

344
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,700
a bounded amount of time instead we are

345
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,510
looking for unbounded no malleability so

346
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,019
do we need to do something more

347
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:43,470
then extract leak that we use is that we

348
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,690
do reconstruct the sha mystical sharing

349
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,100
in a different way so instead of using

350
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,519
the classical Lagrangian interpolation

351
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,230
we use something which we call twice

352
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,019
reconstruction double reco structure so

353
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,029
let's see what EE was touching me means

354
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:01,440
with an example so let's suppose that we

355
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:03,750
want to do a fire of five out of n Sigma

356
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,870
sharing so the trash of this equal to

357
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:09,329
five and instead of setting this the

358
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:13,290
mill the Shamir's threshold do to be

359
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:15,989
tree will be because would be 5-2 we set

360
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,939
it to two so it would be five minus

361
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,010
three while we do this thing is because

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,620
we need to have extra space for this

363
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:25,079
double reconstruction so what we get is

364
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,230
a threshold sigil sharing with parameter

365
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:32,370
five for n so five reconstruction aim

366
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:35,940
for privacy so let's suppose that

367
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,889
versary comes and send a time varying

368
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,130
function and a reconstruction set one

369
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:44,040
two three six and then what we do is

370
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,579
that okay one and two are the minimal

371
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,120
indexes in this set so we use one two to

372
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,949
reconstruct the secret key and then we

373
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,820
want to reconstruct the ciphertext using

374
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:59,040
the indexes three six and then and what

375
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,370
we do is that we divided it in two sets

376
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,349
we use the set three and six and it set

377
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,020
six and then and we do twice the

378
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,428
reconstruction so we can do this thing

379
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,949
because we said at the treasured

380
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:13,410
appropriately so we have reconstruct

381
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,390
once and we get a ciphertext C then

382
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,809
we'll construct another time using the

383
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:21,299
the indexes six and then and we we get

384
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,949
the cipher text C Prime and now we check

385
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,379
this thing so we check that the

386
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,689
ciphertext C and the savage three prime

387
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,880
are the same if they are not they are

388
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,450
not the same then we send an error which

389
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,549
means that there will be a self-destruct

390
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:40,650
so now what this thing works basically

391
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:44,340
the thing is the following so as I

392
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,380
showed you before a before the attacker

393
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,300
could

394
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,920
leaked information about s13 to here so

395
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,960
it could has fed this information and

396
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,140
then thanks to the construction it would

397
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,560
leak information out of a tampering

398
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,300
query so now we need to show that this

399
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,000
kind of thing cannot work it cannot

400
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,639
happen so to do that we showed that the

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,970
average condition I mean entropy of s 1

402
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,730
3 2 given the leakage meaning that a

403
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:21,410
construction using this the the indexes

404
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:24,290
s 1 2 3 in temperate s 1 2 6 doesn't

405
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,110
give us any information so to do so we

406
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,050
use this equation so the content of this

407
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,000
equation we use the fact that if the

408
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,180
reconstruction is good if they if they

409
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,540
if there is no self-destruct then C

410
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,870
prime is going to be equal to C is going

411
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,730
to be equal to C prime so now we need to

412
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:49,280
bound the average condition I mean enter

413
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,900
B of s 1 3 2 given this leakage but you

414
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,440
see here that this leakage is

415
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,630
independent respected to the s 1 3 2

416
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,110
because we are in the individual country

417
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:03,230
model so those are different indexes

418
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,360
that refer are different shares so if

419
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,320
even if you manipulate them you cannot

420
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,240
get any information from s 1 3 2 which

421
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,870
means that the average condition I mean

422
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,590
interview s 1 3 2 it didn't drop it's

423
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:22,219
still the same so this thing can not

424
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:26,659
make any leakage then of course at some

425
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,730
point C will be different than C Prime

426
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,220
so in this equation doesn't hold anymore

427
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,440
but then in this case there will be a

428
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,480
drop in the conditional average mean

429
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,580
entropy but this thing happens only once

430
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,670
happens only once at the end when we

431
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,010
have the self-destruct so in that point

432
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:48,440
we can resort to the leakage resilience

433
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:50,360
of the scheme ok so we did it so the

434
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,850
main trick that we use was this

435
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,040
composition of our our building block a

436
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,919
secure sharing and then reconstructing

437
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,060
twice semi-secret sharing and also there

438
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,190
is yet another trick

439
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,010
we needed and then I don't have enough

440
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:06,560
time and to explain it but basically is

441
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,540
a property is our easy property of

442
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,080
polynomial interpolation if you want to

443
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:17,840
know more you you can ask me offline so

444
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:20,330
to conclude so in our paper we we have

445
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,370
this scheme and then I promise you to

446
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,050
have a rate one continuously no

447
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,110
malleable code actually that scheme is

448
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:29,300
not red one is rate zero we have a rate

449
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,580
compiler that take any continues to be

450
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,889
no malleable secret sharing which has

451
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:38,030
read zero and it amplified array to be

452
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:40,570
read one then we have an application to

453
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:44,360
treasure signature with local adversary

454
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,570
and then we have follow-up paper that

455
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,459
has gone appear at the CC nineteen where

456
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,840
we close the gap

457
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,330
so between reconstruction and and and

458
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,939
privacy and we also have a different

459
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:10,189
model of tampering like the joint

460
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:11,750
tampering model and that's all thanks we

461
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:17,300
have time for questions the microphones

462
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:19,280
are at both end of the eyes and and if

463
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,810
there are no questions let's take the

464
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,649
speaker again

465
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,649
[Applause]
