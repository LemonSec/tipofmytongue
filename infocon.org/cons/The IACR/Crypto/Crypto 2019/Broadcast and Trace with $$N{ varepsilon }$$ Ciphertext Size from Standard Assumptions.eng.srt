1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,600
thanks for the introduction yeah can you

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,070
hear me yeah so I'll be

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,410
country switch shots effort exercise

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,350
this is joint work with Rishabh NGO open

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,080
waters in ten weeks so first let me tell

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,640
you about what brackets and traces and

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,619
in a nutshell broadcasting trace

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,630
combines two different primitives that

9
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:28,570
are broadcast encryption and Twitter

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:31,030
tracing in such a way that the combined

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,480
protocol is more powerful than taking

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,340
the true primitive individually so in

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,500
more detail let me review what traders

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,830
were singin broadcast encryption or so

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,019
in a traditional scheme you have it's a

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,720
public key encryption scheme where there

17
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:49,989
are many potential receiving receivers

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,970
with each with individual keys and the

19
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,669
main feature is that you there's a way

20
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,650
to trace colliding users so what does

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,870
that mean here are suppose that Alice

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,269
and Bob producer de Kooning birds that

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,970
can decrypt the message or infer any

24
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,830
meaningful information about the message

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,720
then you want there to be a tracing

26
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,580
procedure that identifies at least one

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,840
traders that participate in decoding the

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:17,469
books in a broadcast broadcast

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,820
encryption scheme it has somewhat the

30
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,719
same syntax in the sense that there are

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,880
many users each with respective keys but

32
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,009
now what you the functionality provides

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,939
a way to target a specific subset of

34
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:33,520
users so say when I am quit I provide

35
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:35,679
this for instance subset subset s as a

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,560
part of the encryption and only Bob and

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,020
Carol would be authorized to decrypt and

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,189
in particular Alice won't have any

39
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,259
meaningful

40
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,469
will be able to infer any meaningful

41
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:49,450
information about the message so

42
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:53,288
similarly for instance if the target set

43
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,920
of recent users is is this then these

44
00:01:53,289 --> 00:02:00,130
are additive Bob authorized and security

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,390
requires that even if the crude I'm by

46
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,030
combining the information of the

47
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,469
securities there won't be about to infer

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,410
any meaningful information about the

49
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,389
message

50
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,810
okay so what's brackets and trace well

51
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,940
it's a way to combine both so impartial

52
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,590
it's a broadcast encryption scheme so

53
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,440
whenever you're encrypting your message

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,069
you can target a specific set of users

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,280
and similar to trade or tracing

56
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,260
if authorized user' are producing the

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,609
converter boxes then there should be a

58
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,709
meaningful way to trace our traders but

59
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,709
the way that broadcasting trace is

60
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,019
really meaningful and in particular more

61
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,489
powerful than just having broadcast

62
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,930
encryption and show tetris in side by

63
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:48,549
side is by having some require some

64
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,099
property of some security property

65
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:54,489
whenever authorized users collude with

66
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,608
unauthorized user so in particular if

67
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,079
you would simply use protests and trace

68
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,200
a broadcast encryption and chatter since

69
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:05,500
I may say one thing that could happen by

70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,780
using a tracing algorithm would be to to

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,720
trace an unauthorized user which is

72
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,659
really weird because intuitively Alice

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,519
here shouldn't have any she shouldn't

74
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,760
have any power to infer information

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,260
about the message so what will recur

76
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,000
instead is that the tracing algorithm

77
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,489
should trace authorized shredder and

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,799
that's really what makes the primitive

79
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:34,780
much more interesting and holler tribune

80
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,049
okay so let me review a bit of of

81
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,379
previous work so there was a lot of

82
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:44,199
progress in terms of sorcery so the main

83
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:46,629
quantity will be look at a judge the

84
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,310
quality of a scheme will be the

85
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,010
scalability in determining the number of

86
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,319
users so suppose there's many many many

87
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,970
users you want the cipher text size to

88
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,690
be as short as possible that would be

89
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,540
our main consider for comparison so it

90
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,079
turns out that we have many different

91
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,650
primitives from many different

92
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,189
assumptions from standard assumption so

93
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,379
I'll forget about IO or Venus encryption

94
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,448
in son Shiva we have this essentially

95
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:17,940
optimal broadcast encryption from

96
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,289
parings optimal trader fetching from lwe

97
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,280
but it turns out that since more than

98
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:27,550
ten years ago the the best British

99
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,020
entree stream that we have only had

100
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,400
ciphertext a scale with square root of n

101
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:36,010
so if n is B this is job pretty large so

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,690
what we do in this paper is we give our

103
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,659
consumption of a broadcast and regime

104
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,210
with shorts effort exercise so for

105
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,830
arbitrary constant fixed constant a sign

106
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,560
on the cipher text is read only scale as

107
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,630
n to the epsilon and the assumptions

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,350
that we make are both learning reserves

109
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:57,040
and some bananer taps assumptions so in

110
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,860
particularly needs both as a as a

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,110
drawback or tracing procedure needs

112
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,920
master secret key in order to trace

113
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,470
authorized traders but this is energy D

114
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,700
by pretty much all optimal traitor

115
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,950
addressing schemes that we have under

116
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:17,500
standard assumptions so for the rest of

117
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,599
the talk I'll be telling about how to

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,630
build broadcast and trace with short

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,430
cipher text and to do so I will talk a

120
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,940
bit about how we get actually get

121
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,890
optimal traitor tracing from lwe and how

122
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,060
to mirror every step in order to

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:37,690
carefully add broadcast okay so how do

124
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:43,150
we broadcast sorry how do we build a

125
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,980
traitor tracing from elderly very huge

126
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,780
recipe to do that is to use what we call

127
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,990
private linear broadcast encryption that

128
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,750
was introduced by Vanessa headwaters so

129
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,180
I will call that P lb for short and the

130
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,190
idea is really to so you start with a

131
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,710
scheme where everybody can decrypt and

132
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,860
the idea will be Trudy about the users

133
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,380
one by one so what does that mean you'll

134
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,540
have a special type of encryption that I

135
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,000
will call for the forest orchid trace

136
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,510
encryption or you additionally impose

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,960
treasure index and the manatee is that

138
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,950
the user keys with index less than the

139
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,090
threshold will be about to decrypt so

140
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,770
the first property you want is a

141
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,859
distress encryption whenever the

142
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,299
threshold authorizes or the users should

143
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,140
be indistinguishable from a standard

144
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,510
encryption and then when you raise the

145
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,120
threshold you did little better you

146
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,130
disable other keys and in patcher are in

147
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,760
the end notice should be should be

148
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,700
working in some sense

149
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,599
so here the encryption should hide all

150
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,169
the information about the message

151
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,099
so the

152
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:56,859
we want in some kind of privacy of

153
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,960
discretion so then another thing as an

154
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,749
example if the threshold varies from 2

155
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,719
to 2 to 3 of course Bob can tell the

156
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:08,169
difference because in one case his key

157
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:10,150
works and not in the second but what we

158
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,969
want is that Bob should be the only way

159
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:17,438
only a person who is about to tell the

160
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:20,439
difference okay so how do we build

161
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,300
traitor fessing from such a primitive so

162
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,249
suppose we have a decoding box that

163
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,729
allows to infer meaningful information

164
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:30,789
about the message well first we'll

165
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,740
switch to this tracing this tracing mode

166
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,969
and in particular this will be

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,560
indistinguishable from the edge of the

168
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:39,819
decoder so the decoder will still work

169
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,460
with this new cipher text but we know

170
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,740
that if we increase the threshold of the

171
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,659
way down then the decoder shouldn't work

172
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,930
because the there's no information

173
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:51,580
anymore about the message here so what

174
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,399
happens is that there has to be some

175
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,938
index starting on which the decoders

176
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,849
stops working in some sense so what

177
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,610
happens is that there's some index such

178
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,870
that the decoder works here but suddenly

179
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,580
it kind of stops working here and

180
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,310
because of our privacy property over

181
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,878
there the only way the decoder could

182
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,740
have meaningful differently meaningfully

183
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,789
different behavior between those two is

184
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,699
if the secret g2 was used to produce the

185
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,039
decoder burrs so in particular that

186
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,199
means that this index correspond to a

187
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,059
trader and we can flight this user at

188
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:37,229
the trailer okay so how do we add

189
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,000
broadcasting to that we'll use a very

190
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,579
similar idea where we'll disable users

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,100
one by one but now we want to only trace

192
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:47,380
authorized user so the natural thing to

193
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,670
do is to only disable authorized users

194
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,029
one by one so what happens is similar as

195
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,430
before

196
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:57,819
now you trespasser you start with a

197
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,769
broadcast encryption scheme and now

198
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:02,589
you'll add a threshold that will

199
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,170
additionally disabled users so in

200
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,000
particular

201
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,349
even in the beginning Alice is disabled

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,310
because she's not in the authorized set

203
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,200
and when you increase the threshold well

204
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,500
in the end the message video completely

205
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,690
hidden so the only thing that changes is

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,709
the privacy property with mentioned

207
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:24,440
before in particular for instance if I

208
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:28,699
increase the threshold from one church

209
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,410
to - what we want is that the key from

210
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:32,719
any student they have helping

211
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,540
distinguish in some sense if she's not

212
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,410
able to decrypt the message in the first

213
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,939
place her t shouldn't help well in

214
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,540
finding in finding meaningful

215
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,699
information about the treasure editor so

216
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,010
instead what we want that when we

217
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:51,680
increase the threshold here the only key

218
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,779
is that allowed to tell the difference

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,930
between two different indices are the

220
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:02,149
ones that are authorized okay and

221
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,579
similarly as before now if we have a

222
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:07,130
decoder did good decoding works we can

223
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,649
set the threshold to include other

224
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,269
authorized users disable them one by one

225
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:15,829
and the same argument as before simply

226
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:21,589
states that the user that will trace

227
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:22,880
will be now in the indoors right set so

228
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,370
that gives our general recipe for

229
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,490
broadcast on trains so let me know the

230
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,640
back to treasure tracing so with the

231
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:37,490
broadcast how do we build such a scheme

232
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:41,149
so first step is to add attribute based

233
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,399
encryption so if you were at the base

234
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,660
pepper top from rhythm you know that

235
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,060
like you know now attribute based

236
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,670
encryption scheme there's secret cheese

237
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,810
with respect to policies and encryption

238
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:58,099
with respect to attributes and only the

239
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:01,339
only way the keys can decrypt the

240
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:06,860
ciphertext is if said attributes decree

241
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:08,510
- 1 so what it does is simply shifts all

242
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,510
the message there with your delivery

243
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,760
part towards the a B and now what we all

244
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,380
have to do is simply define this policy

245
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:22,170
that states whether user

246
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:24,600
are authorized to decrypt or not oh yeah

247
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,240
so if you know Prevnar protocol

248
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,450
encryption users the crypto either

249
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,020
nothing or the message with some privacy

250
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,360
property over there then in a mixed

251
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:41,370
functional encryption scheme the only

252
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,320
thing we need to do is true to to

253
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,590
decrypt to a boolean that states whether

254
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,910
users are authorized or not

255
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,610
so in particular in the standard

256
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:55,380
encryption in the in the bottom all the

257
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,480
cheese will decrypt you one so more

258
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,400
convenient actually a more convenient

259
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,720
way to actually see that will be that

260
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,760
the mixer fee will be used to disable

261
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,760
traitors and we get back to that later

262
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,589
okay so how do we build such

263
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,860
circumstance and the main tool that will

264
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,830
use our private Trojan pure ifs that we

265
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,830
shall be PCRF and what our PCP ahrefs

266
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,380
those are pseudo-random functions that

267
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,020
can additionally be constrained so if

268
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,689
you have a predicate that takes as input

269
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:31,620
an input to the player then you get a

270
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,930
new key such that the predicate defines

271
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,470
when whether you are allowed to compute

272
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,900
the original PRF or not so a say if the

273
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,390
predicate a value then you are about to

274
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,350
compute the original pure value but if

275
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:49,439
the if the predicate values to 1 then

276
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,760
the original value of the PRF remains

277
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,070
pseudo-random even given the chip oh

278
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,439
yeah so another tional property that we

279
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,930
use is that the concerning should be

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,290
private in the sense that given

281
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,329
true keys well of course the trick is

282
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,300
going to evaluate the same way on a

283
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,620
point why the predicates differ and the

284
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,719
privacy property that we want is that

285
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,300
this should actually be the only way you

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,790
can tell the truth true question keys

287
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,280
apart ok so how do we build yeah and you

288
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,880
get a practical some pairs from elderly

289
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,240
reaction oh yeah so how do you build a

290
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,730
mixer free from a practical some parents

291
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,360
the idea would be to gh every user an

292
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,499
evaluation of the PRF under index and

293
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,300
then to decrypt we'll check whether this

294
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:43,879
the value they get is the same as a

295
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,628
variation of a constraint key over their

296
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,089
index so more pictorially what happens

297
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,949
for instance for the standard encryption

298
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:57,829
scheme that we want to always decryption

299
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:59,209
1 if we take a PRF sorry a constant

300
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:01,998
current that is constrained everywhere

301
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:03,829
then this those two values will be

302
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:07,189
different with hyper agent that will

303
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:09,589
always equal to 1 but more generally if

304
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:13,849
you had the threshold you'll have a key

305
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,259
an encryption that kind of allows to

306
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:20,600
compute the original value above the

307
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:22,429
threshold and not under and popular here

308
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,579
Alice will be about to compute the right

309
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:27,740
value so she will decrypt to 0 and the

310
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,559
other users follow other users the

311
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:35,929
original peer value is pseudo random so

312
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:39,019
that will decrypt one okay so in

313
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,959
particular the privacy property of the

314
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,100
pure of the PCP RF exactly tell us that

315
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,888
the only way to tell the difference

316
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:50,920
between two consecutive thresholds is to

317
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:52,730
have the pure value of corresponding to

318
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,128
true somewhere where the predicate

319
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,209
differs and that's exactly what we want

320
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,209
for the for the mean self-esteem

321
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:03,049
okay so how do we add broadcasting

322
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,719
through all of that so the first thing

323
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:06,889
so it is that if we have an attribute

324
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,199
based encryption that is strong enough

325
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:12,889
we can defer all the broadcast

326
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,910
functionality into the into the a B so

327
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,319
now the ID would also test whether the

328
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,889
users are authorized and will only

329
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:25,399
deliver the message in that case but so

330
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:27,589
we are not done and the main property of

331
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,299
the broadcast that we must still have

332
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,220
should be inferred by the by some kind

333
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,910
of mixture fee that we shall have to

334
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,350
implement so again if we start with

335
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:41,179
augmented broadcast encryption over

336
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,710
there where the vadimus the decryption

337
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:46,640
over some cheese

338
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,320
either bottom or the message also say

339
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,720
here with the treasure the diesel was

340
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,740
this user what we know from broadcast

341
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,410
mistake is a slightly different

342
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,149
syntactically so in particular in the

343
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:03,260
standard encryption all the kids with

344
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:07,339
decrypt one and we slightly change the

345
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,490
decryption property so that unauthorized

346
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,100
users will always decrypt you one

347
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,440
so that's slightly different

348
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,080
synthetically but what we want is that

349
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:24,290
the only way always that you can tell

350
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,330
the difference between a between mix of

351
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,099
the encryption that allows everybody in

352
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:32,149
some sense to run a disappearo

353
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:38,600
everybody is to have the key for someone

354
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:41,480
who is in the indoor tri-state okay so

355
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,120
how do we build that and the inside will

356
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,790
be true or will follow a similar pattern

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:52,580
as before and now so we first want to

358
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,290
ensure that for users that are not in

359
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,430
the tri-state there should always equal

360
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,610
to one so how do we do that the main

361
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:05,839
idea is to make the checked value that

362
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:10,699
we have kind of unpredictable even given

363
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:13,280
all of the keys so how do we do that the

364
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:18,140
idea would be to have many different

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,689
pair of keys and you have some values in

366
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,559
this check some value that remains

367
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:28,339
pseudo-random even given all the keys so

368
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,580
if we sum over if the door check value

369
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,450
is this one then in particular it comes

370
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,159
contains a value like that so I'll

371
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,370
explain with a picture later and in

372
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,260
patcher the value will be super honor so

373
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,030
in popular for every user so sort of

374
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,700
like as many kisses as there are users

375
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:50,389
and users will get evaluations on their

376
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,190
index only for different keys so what

377
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,600
happens is that in the zone you'll use

378
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,920
some some value that nobody

379
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,060
and that would make the check

380
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,550
pseudorandom and that will make the

381
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:06,889
decryption output one okay so that's

382
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,629
that works worse but there's Joe

383
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,070
Synthetica program in particular it's

384
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,610
not clear at all how to even evaluate

385
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:18,080
this in part well before what you had is

386
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,580
was the encryption was a concern key but

387
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,350
now you don't want to give all the

388
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,510
control key individually because

389
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,080
otherwise the argument of this being

390
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,820
pseudo-random wouldn't hold so the idea

391
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,629
is to use some additional property of

392
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,120
the pcrf that's called queue morphism so

393
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,490
what this property it says that to

394
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,989
compute a sum over different keys of

395
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,180
pure values there's two way to do it

396
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:45,500
either you can simply compute the sum of

397
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:48,110
the of the outputs or you can perform

398
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:52,370
some homework operation over the keys

399
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:56,840
and then evaluate the PRF and what is

400
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,610
and this allows us to do is to to take a

401
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,179
similar some as before over there

402
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:07,429
constraint keys and that will get rid a

403
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:09,650
finished construction okay so what we

404
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,260
get overall is a broadcast and trace

405
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,340
encryption starting from attribute based

406
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,530
encryption and Proteus kicks SE and i

407
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,419
roughly showed how to do the broadcast

408
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,680
mix self-esteem

409
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,720
starting from t home working private

410
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,520
concern curves and those we can also

411
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,960
build from LW okay but still I didn't

412
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,170
talk about our efficiency ello

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,620
so what's going on here well in the end

414
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,980
what in the in the final scheme the

415
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:43,189
ciphertext will pretty much be an actual

416
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,870
API ciphertext in terms of that IDs with

417
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,820
ciphertext well we have fun building our

418
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:52,520
Maps so in some sense the IP will also

419
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,730
provide a brilliant broadcast part and

420
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,930
that's why in some sense the broadcast

421
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,710
functionality comes from the band in

422
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,830
your parts in some sense but that's

423
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,930
their straw program in the sense that

424
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,720
IDs from bolero Maps only support can of

425
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,430
which kind of families of policies small

426
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,520
small value of polices

427
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,280
and partially for we know all those a B

428
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,020
streams only support policies in Antigua

429
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,300
and recoated here the policy that

430
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,980
dictates whether users are authorized to

431
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:27,919
decrypt or not is given by this

432
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:30,140
broadcast mr. Feig decryption so jumping

433
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,670
but back to the construction this

434
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:38,260
British mr. figure decryption was

435
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:40,400
private a private Osen purity variation

436
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,990
so it turns out that if you look in the

437
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,010
hood this is done using a roughly

438
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,820
ligament application so this is not

439
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,500
known to be in anyone as is so the final

440
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,679
ingredient that we have is to

441
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,320
pre-compute blocks of blocks of matrices

442
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,910
so that Union to evaluate you only need

443
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,500
to multiply a constant number from

444
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:04,570
matrices and that you can read and see

445
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:09,050
what and partyer the encryption part

446
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:13,750
will consist of many of n to the epsilon

447
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,750
as matrices over there

448
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:22,010
cool so as open questions as we showed

449
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,690
how to to build bridges and tries with n

450
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,960
to the observance of a text size it's a

451
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,730
really natural question to ask whether

452
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,420
this could be brought down towards

453
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,400
pre-rally

454
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:36,620
as well that would be that we call much

455
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,370
more quality but we have to understand

456
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:43,100
al and roughly what our social before is

457
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,239
that this could follow from true true

458
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,110
different also going to kind of

459
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,070
progresses either from to have stronger

460
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:56,750
Abi's certainty B's or even or

461
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:58,570
alternatively have P refs with more

462
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,210
efficient evaluation

463
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,129
unless we could ask you have slightly

464
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,370
milder stronger assumptions in all

465
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,660
conceptions so that's it's funny if you

466
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,250
have any questions I'll be happy to take

467
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:15,240
them

468
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:17,950
[Applause]

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:26,440
right thank you are there any questions

470
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:28,720
so I was wondering um if I got it

471
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,790
correctly the trader tracing gives you

472
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,060
the guarantee that you will get one of

473
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,820
the authorized traders there any known

474
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,030
results regarding getting all the

475
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,669
traders that combine the decryption box

476
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,050
so for treacherous choice of tracing is

477
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,500
not clear but at least something that

478
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:50,530
you can do is protease on trace is safe

479
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,200
like a trader and then if the decoding

480
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,090
Burke's still works over the author I

481
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,630
said where you remove the trader then

482
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,639
you can seal the short race and like

483
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,000
remove the motors run a little one at a

484
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
time

485
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,700
so that's like not something you can do

486
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,050
generativist resort racing but that's

487
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,070
also something that is really

488
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,470
interesting which broadcasts on choice

489
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:13,450
okay all right if there are no further

490
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:19,390
questions let's think Billy again

491
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:19,390
[Applause]
