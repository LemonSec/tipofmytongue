1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:12,000
so thank you for the introductions and

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,940
good morning everyone my name's me I

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,759
will present our work this is a new

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,570
private intercession protocol from outer

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,150
space OT tensions and this cook with

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,840
Benny and a visionary from Ba Island

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,570
University Mike from Oregon State

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,809
University

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:38,579
so maybe you attended another psi talk a

10
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,220
few days ago and my now what is psi but

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,670
I also want to go through a simple

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,329
scenario psi so here we have two parties

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,510
Alice and Bob each has a set of items

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,940
and now they want to compute the

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,610
intersection of the set on the way that

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,899
they don't want to leave any

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:03,809
informations except for the

18
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:06,450
intercessions so psi has many

19
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:10,319
applications and my favorite one is

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,310
private contact Congress in this

21
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:18,990
scenario you you have we have Alice with

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,350
the phone and a list of her friends on

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,249
the other side we have Paul who is the

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,380
Skype server provider and he has a list

25
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:34,229
of users and now Alice want to find out

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,759
which of her friends a new Skype so that

27
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,859
she can chat with them obviously we want

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,799
to compute the intercession of their

29
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:48,298
database without revealing anything so

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,349
they have many and many personal

31
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:57,539
applications like DNA settings online

32
00:01:52,349 --> 00:02:00,569
advertising about botnet detections so

33
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:03,419
before go into our protocol

34
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:07,229
I would like to because about

35
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:10,829
communication complexity of psi from Z

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:16,770
no Simpsons he one wavefunction an OT

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,500
hybrid so the naive solution you you

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,240
need to

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:27,390
every item of x2 every item of why so

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:31,200
clearly the complexity en square and

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,980
later several works you hashing scheme

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:40,299
to map the item into bin and now compute

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:46,269
psi ping piping it reduced the cost to n

44
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:49,240
log n a few years ago with cuckoo

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,450
hashing the communication cost in a Perl

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:56,680
inner little mega n is still not linear

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,619
and this book is the first linear

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,540
communication psi protocol from the

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,020
Zener or some sense I mean one wave

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,959
function and ot hybrid and the work of

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:15,880
for noble and ostrov keys is the

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:18,250
concurrent group so this so I will I

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,820
will cost about the comparator name L

54
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:26,620
later but for now here is the outline of

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,489
my talk because our protocol is by on a

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,080
paper chain first so I will present if

57
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:39,310
functionality and how we you it for how

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,570
you is for psi and then I will present

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,230
hours passed

60
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:51,400
ot PSI contractions and it's peer mentor

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:55,829
numbers so for simplicity I want to

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:00,480
present I want to present the random OT

63
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:04,750
where Alice input it just one bit and

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,230
and he receive the OT value which

65
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:12,550
correspond to her choice on the other

66
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:17,250
side we have Bob he receive two OT

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:21,609
values from the protocol and the

68
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,720
important thing is that it does no Alice

69
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:28,650
those are no Alice joy B's and Alice

70
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,910
doesn't know another OT that bob has

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:36,520
totally the functionality of

72
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:41,200
random ot and now I want to show you how

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:44,620
we use for 4 psi but it's not a correct

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,630
protocol that we want to use so this one

75
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,060
if for the PSI with a small domain and

76
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:56,050
the basic idea is that the party will

77
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:00,970
run as many ot instance at the size of

78
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:03,910
the domain so it means not here we have

79
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,430
a domain age so we have eight random

80
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:13,600
oaties and for example if Alice had

81
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,320
number one number three and number a and

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,680
indeed her input to the OT depend on her

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,770
set so what does that mean so look at

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,480
first random ot you can see that Alice

85
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:34,960
had number one so her input to this past

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:37,350
Oh de a big one and C receive the mm1

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,680
one corresponding to her choice

88
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:46,330
on the other side above received two

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:50,970
random values ot so now for the second

90
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:54,430
ot because number two isn't in her set

91
00:05:50,970 --> 00:06:02,320
so her choice her choice B to the second

92
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:05,290
OT is 0 and C god m20 the same thing for

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:12,730
number three with the Choi beast is one

94
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:17,190
so on and so far so now if bob has

95
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:21,220
number two number three and number four

96
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:27,820
so Bob only look at the blue values M 2

97
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:31,870
1 & 3 1 and M 4 1 and the next peppy pop

98
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:36,820
will perm you the the value and then

99
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:40,900
send this value to Alice so Alice also

100
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,750
only look at her red value right and now

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,020
does the comparisons

102
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,860
and you can see that empty one show up

103
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:57,810
into cept so number two eat the

104
00:06:49,860 --> 00:07:02,040
intercessions so certainly the the just

105
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,920
example for psi using random ot but they

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,220
have two problems

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,250
actually it's alternate communication

108
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:14,570
and a second one in you need to use the

109
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,090
OT for every items in the domain and

110
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:25,190
this one is impractical for the big

111
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:25,190
domain so how to handle these problems

112
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,080
so I will go to our

113
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:37,500
I will tell you our solutions using ours

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:40,770
fast ot but before that I want to like

115
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,860
tell you about ot tensions which is

116
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,919
first proposed by beavers already two

117
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,160
decades ago

118
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,969
so the OTA OTA very expensive if you've

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,480
seen Papa keys but now you can have a

120
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,930
small number of keys ot and then

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,350
extending it to get many ortiz everyone

122
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:08,550
using symmetric keys so that one a very

123
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:11,460
efficient in terms of computation but

124
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:20,100
you still need to to pay one written to

125
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:22,409
a bit for each ot and I also want to go

126
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,490
a little bit more detail about how ot

127
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:30,060
tension works so first part is run a

128
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:35,339
small number of based random ot and this

129
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,400
one you papa key and if Party against

130
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:45,140
some random output that the new as a

131
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:49,230
seed and the next step the party will

132
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,680
locally attend their seed to many values

133
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,560
to pee

134
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,050
and the length of the total end of the

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:04,920
pensions is the total number of ot

136
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:10,290
incidents that they want so now looking

137
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:15,270
at the OT instant I alex somehow can

138
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:18,740
compute her ot output however to help up

139
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,780
our POC Hicks OTV values

140
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,920
Alice has to send the OT correction

141
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:31,050
values which is the value P I here which

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:35,219
looks random to Bob so having PI Bob now

143
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:40,500
can compute mi 0 and M i1 so te hau OT

144
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:46,200
tensions and now for example if Alice

145
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:49,530
hats number 3 number 7 and number I see

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:54,020
I only care about the direct value here

147
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:58,170
the material number 7 enemy I right

148
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:01,380
similarly if bob has number 5 number

149
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:07,560
seven and nine she only cares he only

150
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:10,770
care about the blue values so if you use

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,010
the current ot tensions you have to send

152
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,590
all the P I values for every time every

153
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:22,620
item is in the domain and this is

154
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:24,810
expensive so we want to avoid it so we

155
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,500
have to question right now the first

156
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:32,869
question is how to send P I without

157
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:37,320
revealing I and the second question is

158
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:40,500
we indeed generate many of these many

159
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:47,370
number of ortiz but you we only care

160
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:50,510
some of them alright so we have a new

161
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:55,680
idea to avoid the sending the hue metric

162
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:59,490
so alex books of PA TI values into the

163
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,880
polynomial so far it's a mode this

164
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,230
polynomial got two rules the poetry and

165
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,360
peach

166
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:15,740
what really the in her said similarly

167
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:22,010
seven and p7 and I and P I and now Alice

168
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:24,860
sends the polynomial to Bob yeah so it's

169
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:29,480
easy to see that if Alice has n items

170
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,670
this polynomial have n coefficients so I

171
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:37,970
mean that sending the polynomial is

172
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:42,620
equivalent to sending n values so now

173
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:47,980
having the polynomial pop interpolate

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:52,280
that one at the pole p2 get P P beep 5

175
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:57,620
at the point seven to get the P 7 the OT

176
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:01,040
correction value and I and P I and the

177
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,500
main observation EDA if both parties had

178
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,349
the same items for number seven right so

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:12,590
what we get this the correct correct

180
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:21,890
correct correct and ot values that Alice

181
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:28,490
has so with beef I Bob can compute M on

182
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:32,230
his ot values and Phi 1 and M of M Phi 0

183
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:35,660
and M Phi 1 would be seven he compute

184
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:44,390
and I'm seven one and the same thing for

185
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:49,850
MI and now on the other side Alice Alice

186
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:53,030
can compute M T 1 M 7 1 and M i1 so the

187
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,510
party compared the oth values in the

188
00:12:53,030 --> 00:13:02,150
clear and you can see that both party

189
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:06,680
have m71 and my one so it mean they are

190
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,959
in the intercessions so so we are done

191
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,380
with the first questions using

192
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:16,550
polynomial and now we are going to the

193
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:19,189
second questions so the recall that up

194
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,880
all party have to you Piazzi to ten

195
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:26,630
let's see too many values however we

196
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:32,110
only care some of them so very simple

197
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:36,290
solution is we replace Phe with the PAF

198
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:40,490
and we have several tricks to compute

199
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:44,209
this pif efficiently but you can see the

200
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:52,279
people how to do it so we are done with

201
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:56,119
our protocol for the security the view

202
00:13:52,279 --> 00:14:00,709
of pop either polynomial over the

203
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,079
correction OT values and at least you

204
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,018
have inputs to interpolate these

205
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:11,449
polynomials you can see as 1 a 2 & a 3

206
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:15,230
here however because all the p PX

207
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,140
randoms so listen this polynomial looks

208
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:23,110
random to Bob

209
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,110
therefore it hide the Alex imp except

210
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,620
for the viewer pop-out sorry for the

211
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:36,020
viewer bollocks

212
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:38,959
if the the item Y is an intercept so

213
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,740
Alice never interpolate about this point

214
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:46,969
you can see why and py the collection OT

215
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:51,290
value py here but the poll interpolating

216
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:56,180
something like here so we show that if

217
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,880
if the capital P and small piece you far

218
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,620
in the meaning of Hamming distance so

219
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,020
the size of the few sides should be

220
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:09,890
around 3.5 security parameters and now

221
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:14,480
the basics the automatic my1 looks

222
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:18,949
random to Alex so the proof is a bit

223
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:26,990
complicated so just see the paper for

224
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:30,300
for more details and the bottleneck of

225
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,450
our construction is the polynomial of

226
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,689
raisins the reason is you can see its

227
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:42,300
help the hue degree and the fuse eyes a

228
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,660
very big so similar to prefer books when

229
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:49,880
you hash tube in scheme to map the items

230
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:55,860
into things so we have many small

231
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:59,510
degrees polynomials and one cabin so

232
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,700
it's very efficient to interpolation

233
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:07,800
however we need to pet the dummy items

234
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:12,510
to hide the actual bin size so this one

235
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:17,130
increase the communication cost also we

236
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:19,740
use a specific new hashing scheme so

237
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:26,640
that the number of the missed items is

238
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:31,440
only 2% of the set size okay so for the

239
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:35,819
compare reasons so our protocol we have

240
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,150
so we have two protocol variants the

241
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,490
first one have the big plenum you and

242
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:45,870
the and the second one is the small

243
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,670
polynomial with the hashing scheme so

244
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,010
for the first one we send the big

245
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,300
pronoun meals which is equivalent that

246
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:59,490
to sending n value so here we have n

247
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:03,180
value to send and n value to receive so

248
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:08,040
the communication cost about 500 big per

249
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:11,190
item for the second barons because we

250
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:16,020
use the hashing scheme so they have to

251
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:20,760
percents in number gloomy items you to

252
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:25,410
hash functions so we need we we have 1.0

253
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:28,680
n st. and to end received and the

254
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,830
communication cost about 600 with per

255
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,830
item

256
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,340
compared to OT based a PSI there are

257
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,260
protocols from how we need to you about

258
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,129
1 or 1.5 and a private membership

259
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,070
and English 50% is the deme item most

260
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:53,480
and they need to give three hash

261
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:57,649
functions so I mean they need 1.5 n sin

262
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,590
and TN receive their communication cost

263
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:04,399
about 500 or about thousand hundred per

264
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:08,299
item which is two times more than our

265
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:13,010
protocol so for the oklahoma-based

266
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:16,158
psi then again stand and to NBC and you

267
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:20,419
can see the protocol fingers and their

268
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:24,549
communication costs above 576 big-boy

269
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:28,220
items which do more than our protocol

270
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,570
and we are the best community our

271
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:35,000
protocol has the best communication cost

272
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,649
so in summarised compared to their

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,059
fishermen based psi our protocol is 2 to

274
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:47,539
20 times less 10 to 20 times less

275
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:52,269
communications and we have to two two to

276
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:58,250
seven times faster in the terminal term

277
00:18:52,269 --> 00:19:02,320
compared to OT based psi our protocol

278
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,720
you fought for two fora to afford 40 to

279
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,220
50% less communications sick times

280
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:13,580
slower inland setting but 2041 setting

281
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,990
but our protocol is the cheapest even

282
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,350
the mean in the measurement of

283
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,500
computation and communication costs and

284
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:26,600
we used Amazon Web service price for

285
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,639
this one and we have with our proto in

286
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,539
the first linear communication protocol

287
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:35,570
in OT hybrid and when we have fortunes

288
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:43,370
and the waterfall logo and Ostrovsky's

289
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:45,740
is a concurrent work so if we put our

290
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,250
two variants in the computation and

291
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,960
community communication graph one

292
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,350
variant in here with allowed

293
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,520
communications and another variants with

294
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,500
the fast

295
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:05,150
in terms of burning time and compared to

296
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:08,150
a rebus book our protocol is cheapest

297
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,780
one so we fought the relented thing we

298
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:17,870
are in this job and for the one setting

299
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:20,809
we are in that zone yeah so for the

300
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,699
future work you can see that the

301
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:26,149
bottleneck of our protocol is the

302
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:30,130
polynomial operation turns so any

303
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:35,300
alternative solution for that one and

304
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:39,650
this talk is for Simeone setting so can

305
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:42,800
we have a linear communication psi bus

306
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:46,330
for militia setting and the last

307
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:50,360
questions Pollak now by reviewer that

308
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:54,559
can we've use ours priorities as the

309
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,159
multi query opf yeah it's done with my

310
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,570
top thank you

311
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:21,600
[Applause]

312
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:23,879
any questions um Paul if you want to

313
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,020
further compute an intersection is it

314
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,800
easy to generalize yeah so right now we

315
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:34,710
send right now we send all the OT value

316
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:38,550
in the clear so this one allows the

317
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,220
receiver check whether that one reviewed

318
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,980
the intercessions right though I don't

319
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,950
know I mean maybe you have another way

320
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,280
to send the polynomial so the party can

321
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:53,250
check the interesting intersection in

322
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,160
some circuit or whatever so the party

323
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,740
will learn the share of the bid whether

324
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:06,710
they are into intercession or not yeah

325
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:06,710
thank you any other questions

326
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:14,490
okay let's thank the speaker again

327
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,490
[Applause]
