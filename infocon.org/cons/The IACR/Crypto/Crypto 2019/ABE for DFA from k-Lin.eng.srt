1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:12,510
thanks for the introduction and I will

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:16,170
share our work about a B 4 D F a so so

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,960
first in a B schemes so the ciphertext

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,790
is corresponding with attribute X and

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,210
the secret key is corresponding with

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,880
some policies so if the attribute is

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,130
satisfied it is satisfied policy then we

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,830
can recovery curve down message using

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,440
this secret key otherwise we require

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,979
that the messages is hidden even we have

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,699
the secret key and this should be hard

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:46,530
even if we have more more secret more

13
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:50,129
secret keys so in this talk I will focus

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,110
on a B for b fa so where the policy is

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,670
described by a deterministic finite

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,600
automata so let me quickly review the

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:04,799
notion using this example about de la

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,740
Sol Sol DFA has this deal has two two

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,290
states so at the beginning when we run

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,630
the DFA we start from state 1 the

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,960
machine is in state 1 and then it will

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,839
run in several stage and at each stage

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,350
it will read one bit and when when the

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,810
read one bit it will change the state so

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,710
this is this is described by the

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,380
transition functions we will write it

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,658
using the arrows so the lower arrow says

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,759
that if the machine is in state 1 and

29
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,530
input is 0 and we will move to state 2

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,450
so when we read all the bit we are will

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,270
reach some states if the state is 2

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,880
which is called accept state we will

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,110
accept the the input otherwise we just

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,449
reject so I want to remind you that DFA

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,909
define regular language so I write a

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,680
regular expression here so sometimes we

37
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:03,990
call it a B for regular language so the

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,549
advantage is that this allow us to have

39
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,220
a attribute X with arbitrary size this

40
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,830
is different from traditional AV for

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,680
circuit the input is bounded so which is

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,270
very useful for some application like

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,410
tax return

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,240
the data can can be very long so for

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,420
this very useful primitive we have had

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,480
some constructions but all of them

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,790
require q type assumptions the key point

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,359
is that the complexity of the assumption

49
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,429
related to the lens of input X that

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,150
means it's unbounded it's it's not very

51
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,130
good so in our work we give a first a B

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,870
skin for the fa from killing your

53
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,829
assumption this is a static assumption

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:53,760
the complexity is constant so in this

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:57,060
talk I have to explain our idea using

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,799
bilinear group of composite order but I

57
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,230
promise you that everything I were told

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,700
you can be translated into primal group

59
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,709
and can be based on Collini assumption

60
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,959
so the first thing is how to realize the

61
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,660
functionalities so that means we have a

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,310
cipher text for X and a secure key for F

63
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,960
and we can decrypt if X satisfies F so

64
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,710
the first thing is in a ciphertext we

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,720
have a foreign randomness so this

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:28,080
basically basically corresponding to the

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,450
four steps when we run the D F a F write

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,330
this input because because this means

69
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:38,310
that we are at the step zeros we read no

70
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:40,980
bit s1 means we as a state step 1 we

71
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,940
have read we have read the first 0 and

72
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,850
so on then in a secret key we have to

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,670
randomness T 1 and B 2 this basically

74
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,609
means that the D 1 is further at state 1

75
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:58,200
D 2 is for the state to so users MoDOT

76
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:01,410
to safety space so actually when you

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,660
wait decrypt using the secret key and to

78
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,790
decreases the ciphertext we actually

79
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,280
compute some values corresponding to

80
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,380
this D and s so let me first tell you

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,080
the correspondence between the values

82
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,370
and the execution of the FA and I tell

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,700
you the structure of secure key in a

84
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,260
ciphertext so in the first step we said

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,229
that we always start from the start

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,680
state 1 so in in stage one where at

87
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,979
first state 1 so we'll compute a value

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,290
corresponding to a 0 and a d1 so in in

89
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,280
our construction and the basic ordering

90
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,690
based one

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,700
so we can put the product of these two

92
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,530
values then we actually depict the

93
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,870
transition function like this so the dot

94
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,619
here in this column basically means the

95
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:50,100
same state but for the step step one for

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,170
the next step so because we are in the

97
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,280
state one so follow this line we will

98
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,680
move to state two

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,429
so this basically corresponding to these

100
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:04,830
values so actually we need to compute s

101
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,990
1 D 2 from d 0s0 d1 we have obtained so

102
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,349
then we continue this process compute s

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,710
2 D D 1 s 3 D 2 according to the state

104
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,220
we can reach in each step then finally

105
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,130
we will reach this these values and and

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,470
the state 2 is the accept state so it

107
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,210
should be used use this value to recover

108
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,570
the message so generally we will do this

109
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,000
if we can reach you I after reading a

110
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,400
bit then we will computer this can these

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,140
values okay let me tell you the

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,210
structure so you need to do something

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,200
for the start and connect to the message

114
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,570
but we focus on the transitional part so

115
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,229
for this part we want to compute this

116
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,880
value from the previous values we use a

117
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:57,000
separate sub cipher text encoding the

118
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,979
first 0 and the subsequent key encoding

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,240
this transitions so we do we choose a

120
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,890
public parameter the N&W

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,350
which were published in master public

122
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,930
key in the proper form then we actually

123
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,450
encrypt the D 1 and D 2 in this form

124
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,820
which is our gamma like one but share

125
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,419
the randomness then for the cipher text

126
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,969
we connected s 0 and s 1 using this

127
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,820
structure so that we are not recovering

128
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,070
s 1 D 2 individually we actually recover

129
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,190
the difference of this two value such

130
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:34,440
that we can move from s 0 D 1 to s 1 V 2

131
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:38,490
so for all other transition we can do

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,440
the same things example for the ice 0 we

133
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,270
use the same structure but use different

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,289
s or you say Si and si minus 1 and si

135
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,859
for other transit

136
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:52,740
from you to be like we just replace dudv

137
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,969
the corresponding random random values

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,129
in the place of d1 and d2 also we can

139
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:02,009
hope that we have other symbols in the

140
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,740
input so for this case we just choose

141
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,229
different W for each each possible

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,229
symbols and when when we have a

143
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,900
transition on Sigma which is replace W

144
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:18,780
with corresponding W and in a ciphertext

145
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:22,560
if X I X is used to create a use to W

146
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:27,628
exact so this actually is the structure

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,909
used in the first AV for DFA from from

148
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,280
waters so we use but we need to change

149
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,500
the scheme and we work with composite or

150
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,840
group and give a different proof so we

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,219
call this warm-up scheme and tell you

152
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,888
what kind of things we should do so this

153
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:47,729
is takeaway for this part so for the

154
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,529
security we give this examples which is

155
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,359
shorter that means from the expression

156
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:55,110
you can see that it will be rejected by

157
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,080
the DFA so it's basically corresponding

158
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,560
to the execution of DFA on this input

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,060
and now we need to create a hybrid

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,900
corresponding to this one so what what

161
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,620
the hybrid is so in in gg0 its

162
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,529
corresponding to step 0 in step 0 we are

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,560
in state 1 so we are nothing

164
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:22,199
we cannot reach state 2 so we want to

165
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:26,849
say that s 0 DP 2 a pseudo-random then

166
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:29,460
in GG 1 we look at the step 1 so

167
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:32,578
basically that means very similar that

168
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,519
means s 1 d D 1 is a pseudo-random

169
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:37,468
they'll move to the next hybrid so in

170
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,919
this hybrid s2 and the d2l pseudo-random

171
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,380
because D 2 is not reachable so as we

172
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,899
have said that the d2 is except a state

173
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,959
it's corresponding to the message so the

174
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,810
fact that s 2 D 2 is pseudo-random help

175
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,560
us to hide message so this proof this is

176
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:58,469
high level the proof so similar we have

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,880
a gel we have a general way to define

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,310
hybrid I if we

179
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,700
can reach you I after reading I bid we

180
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,640
will define we were defined a GI with Si

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,580
and a DV pseudo-random for all V which

182
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,010
is different from UI so how to real

183
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,280
realize it in this in the secret key and

184
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,870
the cipher test s and a B from two

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,550
components so we need to change the

186
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,280
distribution of a ciphertext and a

187
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,520
secret key so this one is very standard

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,550
for your system encryption the key point

189
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,530
is here we add the Delta IV here so we

190
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,750
defined in this form which depend on

191
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:38,699
whether V is corresponding to the UI and

192
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,200
this means we hide a DV by Delta if V is

193
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,450
not reachable

194
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:48,450
after reading ivett otherwise it's just

195
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:50,490
a clear so at this point the takeaway is

196
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,610
like this we call this execution graph

197
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,340
so with the green part is basically say

198
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,290
what we can recover during the during

199
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,920
the decryption that means the value we

200
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:06,510
can compute so the red dot means that in

201
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,540
each game we want to hide so actually

202
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,330
this also we can read how to assign

203
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,819
there to IV from this graph I actually

204
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,240
from 0 1 2 and a vs1

205
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,150
to green dot means we said there are to

206
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,490
be 0 red dots that said that we said

207
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:30,150
Delta to be said that there Delta IV to

208
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:32,340
be Delta so let's move to the proof but

209
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,750
I must say that we need to change a

210
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,850
little bit about the definition of

211
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,920
hybrid but let me show the proof idea

212
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:42,300
and I see why we need to check why we

213
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,550
need to change the hybrid so we have a

214
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,160
lot of hybrid so the key point is to say

215
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,609
that the dehydration hybrid are

216
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,770
indistinguishable so I want to show you

217
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,460
the statement like this the statement is

218
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,439
over simplified so we need many step to

219
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,780
connect the left hand side to the gene

220
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,930
minus 1 to I minus 1 and the right hand

221
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,910
side to the G G I so but but in this

222
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,030
tour let me just to focus on this very

223
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,520
simple statement as I said with our

224
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,439
definition it's actually wrong we can

225
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,470
find a u to V Sigma

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,470
the the transition the corresponding

227
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,509
term is actually distinguishable so let

228
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,629
me tell you the what kind of a

229
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:27,089
transition so we focus on Sigma equals x

230
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:29,699
I that means we can actually recover

231
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:33,829
this part adhirata part unclear because

232
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:38,099
we know wxi we can actually decrypt it

233
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:40,829
so we just compare this to one so if we

234
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,370
set you it's not equal to UI minus 1

235
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:46,920
that means it cannot reach in the I

236
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:51,629
minus 1 step that means we set it to be

237
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,800
Delta and if we set you be UAV to be UI

238
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:58,410
that means we can reach so it's clearly

239
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,990
it's actually not equal so the statement

240
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,079
is wrong in this case so in order to fix

241
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:08,370
it we need to we need to require that we

242
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:11,160
have such kind of property so if you

243
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,410
have a connection from V to u or input X

244
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,259
I the corresponding Delta should be

245
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,959
equal so in the graph actually if you

246
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:25,500
have a line connecting to dot the dot

247
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:28,729
should be has the same color so the

248
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,860
point is that how to get this

249
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,810
so we require such kind of features so

250
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,800
the point is that we can change the

251
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,018
definition of Delta by just pick V from

252
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,750
if I that means we define fi for each

253
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,509
each hybrid and the front if I we can

254
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,149
define one new Delta IV which satisfy

255
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:52,230
this property so let me show you an

256
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:55,980
example it's a little complex execution

257
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,649
graph so this there are three states the

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,040
first a start state the second the

259
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:05,459
remaining two is accept state and we we

260
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:09,029
draw the transition here so according to

261
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,699
our previous idea we have a path from

262
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:14,430
the start state to this and other states

263
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:18,540
will be colored in red that means we

264
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,339
will argue that it's pseudo-random so

265
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,759
you can see that there are two lines

266
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:28,490
which is problematic we haven't told you

267
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:28,490
so the way to fix it is to set like this

268
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:35,018
so let's come let's come back to this

269
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:39,579
graph this is the right hybrid we can

270
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:44,290
use and satisfy the property here that

271
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:44,888
means the set F 0 to F 3 can be defined

272
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,670
like this

273
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:51,459
we actually don't cover order or others

274
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:55,449
state here and here so we have a smaller

275
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,579
F 1 and a smaller at 2 so actually you

276
00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:00,579
don't need to do all the work like this

277
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:03,399
to define the set we actually can define

278
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:06,250
a set in an iterative way so actually

279
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,160
the last set F 3 corresponding to the

280
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,300
accept state we put all accept state

281
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,329
into into the set then we'll trace back

282
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,609
to define F 2 so f 2 contain our state

283
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:22,449
which will transit to the state in F 3

284
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:27,279
they will trace back to find s 1 then I

285
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:31,209
trace back to find F 0 so this will give

286
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,759
our definition so now with the

287
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:37,209
definition here we have these features

288
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,870
then we can prove this statement so the

289
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:43,540
proof is very simple so for the case

290
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,300
Sigma equals x I we just use the

291
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:50,439
features clearly the two side is equal

292
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:53,378
and the for the the other k Sigma is not

293
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:56,610
equal to X i we just use DD H to hide

294
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,610
the difference between this side

295
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:04,420
actually this is the main idea in the

296
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,509
proof actually we have a more idea to to

297
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,000
carry out the actual proof because we

298
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:12,309
still need to change the cipher text so

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,279
we have more idea like this it's a

300
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:18,759
subgroup hiding but it's enhanced by

301
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,540
giving something like this but hidden in

302
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,000
our gamma type encryption and we also

303
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,980
need to we also need one more group one

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,259
more subgroup to realize such kind of

305
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:34,720
tours then as I told you that the

306
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:37,059
Warnock warm up scheme is not actual

307
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,370
scheme so to move to the actual scheme

308
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,279
we have to do some change but I have no

309
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,829
time to explain why but I just

310
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,069
you the things we want to do we need to

311
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:51,180
copy of the the public parameter like

312
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:54,930
this then we'll create create a secret

313
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,329
key for for each transition and the to

314
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,199
copy it's a parallel just to copy of the

315
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:03,508
secret key the complex step is the the

316
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,529
ciphertext part so for the search for

317
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:13,410
the ciphertext part for X I is encoded

318
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:16,889
using a Z 0 and a W Sigma 0 if I is a is

319
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,790
a of a number so actually switch between

320
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:23,730
the two two system the 2 parameter

321
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,689
depending on the priority of I so this

322
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,100
is our actual scheme

323
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:31,469
okay let's summarize the talk actually

324
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,220
we give a new technique about how to

325
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,889
construct a B for DFA from a standard

326
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,910
static assumption and we really give a

327
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:45,059
new concrete schemes so for the future

328
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:48,809
work I think a lattice first variant

329
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:52,079
should be interesting and the idea to to

330
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:56,550
try to trace the execution of the fa may

331
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,069
be useful in a in a second are you okay

332
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:02,579
thank you

333
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,169
[Applause]

334
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,349
if you have a question please come to

335
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:17,860
the microphone we have a lot of time for

336
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:20,799
question I have one question one

337
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:24,668
question where did you use the

338
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:29,950
selectable security yeah yeah yeah

339
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:32,919
because we just see this one so when you

340
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:37,870
define Delta you need the information

341
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,190
about X ah okay so without information

342
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,709
about this we even don't know how to

343
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,320
simulate the first two secret key so

344
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,350
it's we have to be selective

345
00:17:44,320 --> 00:18:10,330
you know we don't know how to deal with

346
00:17:46,350 --> 00:18:13,149
Thanks okay yeah so this part so we

347
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:18,158
actually use a set of hiding from G 1 2

348
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:19,419
G 3 and G 3 2 G 2 is to start in what I

349
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,400
mean I mean when you prove this

350
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:31,030
statement you need to subgroup hiding

351
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:34,299
step sorry I think this one is a

352
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,428
composite or a group so but you can

353
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,668
translate in the prime of the group it's

354
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,669
fine

355
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:55,119
more questions this census speak again

356
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,119
[Applause]
