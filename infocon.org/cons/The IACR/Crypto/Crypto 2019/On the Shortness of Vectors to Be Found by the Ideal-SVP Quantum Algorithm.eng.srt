1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,620
thank you for the introduction so I'm

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,950
going to talk about short vectors in

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,750
idea lattices ideal lattices are a

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,330
particular kind of Euclidean lattices

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,890
and let computational problems and

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,089
Euclidean analysis provide a strong

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,779
foundation for passports and

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,240
cryptography and essentially you want to

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,519
good cryptography schemes to security

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,348
rely more or less in the problem of

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,119
finding short vectors in such a fijian

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,460
lattices

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,430
how short well how approach you want the

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,070
victor fine vectors will determine the

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,019
difficulty of the problem on any lattice

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,510
you have some shortest vectors these are

17
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:47,400
the hardest to find if you're interested

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,680
in finding the shortest vectors of your

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,960
lattice you can do it thanks to the

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,150
algorithm bkz but it will take you

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,970
exponential time in the dimension of the

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,530
lattice is the point here on this graph

23
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,510
but you can make the problem simpler by

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,309
asking not to find the shortest vectors

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,349
of your lattice but some approximate

26
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,090
shortest vectors vectors that one of the

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,949
shortest but the shortest up to some

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,750
approximation factor and when the

29
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
approximation factor is large the crown

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,410
becomes simpler in particular if

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,030
interested in approximation factors that

32
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,880
are exponential in the dimension then

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,830
you can do this in time polynomial in

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,869
the dimension thanks to the algorithm

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,140
lll it's the point at the bottom of this

36
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,800
graph now I mentioned ideal lattices

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,560
ideal lattices or a particular case of

38
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,509
Euclidean lattices the plan with generic

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,060
lattices is that when you try to design

40
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,630
cryptographic schemes based on problems

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,280
in them you realize very quickly that

42
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,369
you're going to end up with a lot of

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,330
memory and bandwidth requirements so you

44
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,590
can use some lighter alternative

45
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,470
lattices with more structures that allow

46
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,330
you to build faster algorithms faster

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,979
protocols with a lighter in memory and

48
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,610
bandwidth and the typical example of

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,100
this or cyclotomic idea lattices so what

50
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,440
are psychodrama kto lattices the rest of

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,690
the talk I'm going to fix an integer M

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,329
together with a primitive nth root of

53
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:13,740
unity Omega so Omega is a complex number

54
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,840
which raised to the power M is 1 I'm

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,450
defining the field came to be Q a joint

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
Omega

57
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,920
it's the cyclotomic field of conductor m

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,840
it is a number field of degree fee of M

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,500
where a field is an Euler station

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,319
function this field K contains a sub

61
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,569
ring Z brackets Omega which I write o

62
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,260
which is the ring of integers of this

63
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:37,359
field so where are our lattices well K

64
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,760
is a number field of the Griffey of them

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,980
so it embeds into the real vector space

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,200
of dimension fee of M through what we

67
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,910
call minkowski's embedding and through

68
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,548
this embedding of the field into a

69
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,790
vector space the sub ring the ring of

70
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:53,440
integers becomes a lattice so o can be

71
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,650
seen as the lattice is this real vector

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,970
space of dimension fee of M so here we

73
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,099
have a real lattice but in fact we have

74
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,590
many more lattices because any ideal in

75
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:05,048
this ring o is also a lattice in that

76
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,780
vector space and these are what we call

77
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,030
ideal lattices so they come with all

78
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,239
kinds of additional algebraic structure

79
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,380
compared to generic lattices so they

80
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,480
allow you to build very interesting

81
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,069
protocols but of course you have to

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,619
wonder does the problem of finding sure

83
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,298
that just becomes simpler and yes it

84
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,280
does become simpler it has been proven

85
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,780
that we can find short to victors more

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,530
efficiently at least if you have a

87
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,269
quantum computer this is a result of the

88
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,730
long series of works culminating in

89
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,160
primary tour 2017 where it was shown

90
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,290
then that in ideal lattices you can find

91
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,329
in quantum polynomial time a sub

92
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,920
exponential approximation of the

93
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,079
shortest vector so you can cut the graph

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,950
in the middle and here it's quantum

95
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:49,299
polynomial time ok so the object of the

96
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,548
paper I am presenting today is

97
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,920
understanding precisely when do these

98
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,630
quantum algorithms start outperforming

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,518
lll and bkz because these all

100
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,959
asymptotics it doesn't tell much about

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,750
what's happening with concrete

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,959
parameters so how do these algorithms

103
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,760
work they come essentially in two parts

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,430
the first part deals with a particular

105
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,250
family of ideals called principle ideals

106
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,099
a principle idealism and I do that has a

107
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,950
generator meaning that a is principle if

108
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:22,389
it has a generator G which is an element

109
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,400
such that a is just G times the ring G

110
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,470
is called the generator and instead of

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,510
looking at the problem of finding short

112
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,400
elements in a you can look at the

113
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,599
I didn't regenerate to Sophie so it

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,979
sounds like you're making the problem

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,080
more difficult because now instead of

116
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,640
finding a short arbitrary thing you're

117
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,710
asking for a short thing that is also a

118
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,750
generator but it's making the problem

119
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,640
somehow simply by highlighting the

120
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,620
relevant algebraic structure so this is

121
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,270
the approach taken in this series of

122
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,480
work starting by with a

123
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,340
Kember little in 2014 so how do you do

124
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,440
this you look at the following problem

125
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,929
you're given a principal ideal a and you

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,750
look for a shortener a trope a how short

127
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,490
well this short you want it to have

128
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,710
Euclidean norm this quantity where on

129
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,030
the left here you have essentially the

130
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,950
length of the shortest vector of the

131
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,809
lattice and what remains of course is

132
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,760
the approximation factor which in our

133
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,110
case is a sub-exponential quantity in

134
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,240
the dimension so you want to find

135
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,560
something of that length how are you

136
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,390
going to do this it's a two steps

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,280
process you're given a principal ideal a

138
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,289
you know it has a generator where you're

139
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,929
not given a generator so the first step

140
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,550
is to find one so find an arbitrary

141
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,410
generator this is already a non-trivial

142
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,880
problem but it can be solved in quantum

143
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,560
polynomial time it's the result of

144
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:35,080
guessing in 2016 but this algorithm that

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,450
finds a generator finds a generator that

146
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,919
is usually extremely large so the second

147
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,990
step consists in finding your shorter

148
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,550
one why would you find an arbitrary one

149
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,810
in the first place well if you have a

150
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,760
generator you're in a better position

151
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,280
because now you have a search space

152
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,320
you're given an arbitrary generator G of

153
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,020
a so you know that the set of all

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,780
generators is G times o star where L

155
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,630
star is this a group of the group of not

156
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,880
of units of Eureka okay so you have a

157
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,810
short a search space you're looking for

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,100
a short element in this set here so the

159
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,230
way you're going to try to find a short

160
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,270
element in there is by transforming this

161
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,980
problem to a lattice problem through

162
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,120
what we call the logarithmic embedding

163
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,450
and this is what has been done

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,340
incremental 2016 the logarithmic

165
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,050
embedding so here's the definition I'm

166
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,609
not going to go through it but what you

167
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,500
have to understand is simply that it

168
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,270
behaves as you would expect from a

169
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,340
logarithmic map in that it transforms a

170
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,260
multiplicative structure into additive

171
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,020
structure it takes the multiplicative

172
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,520
structure of K star and transforms it

173
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,650
into the additive structure of this

174
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,659
vector space in particular it

175
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,700
transformed the group of units o star

176
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,470
into a lattice which we call the

177
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,140
logarithmic unit lattice

178
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,360
Lago Vista so if we apply this

179
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,840
logarithmic map to our problem what do

180
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,250
we get

181
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,039
remember we're looking for a short

182
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,050
generator of G times L we know that the

183
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,910
set of all generators is G times o star

184
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,880
if we apply the logarithmic embedding

185
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,740
map you are looking for a short element

186
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,750
in a translated lattice because the

187
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,180
logarithm of G times F star is the

188
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,610
logarithm of this element plus this log

189
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,260
unit lattice so now you're looking for a

190
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,350
short element in a translated lattice

191
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,150
that can be done by solving an instance

192
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,930
of the closest vector problem with

193
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,700
respect to this lattice log of F star so

194
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,820
we reduced our problem to a closest

195
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,409
vector problem it's not clear how that

196
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,900
helps because the process Viktor problem

197
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,630
is also a difficult problem unless you

198
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,190
know a lot about your lattice and here

199
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,659
we do know a lot about this lattice the

200
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,640
logarithmic unit lattice has been

201
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,540
studied very thoroughly and we know in

202
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,700
particular a full rank a full rank set

203
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,890
of short vectors in it which can be used

204
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,810
to solve the closest vector problem with

205
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,229
sufficient approximation factor and

206
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,910
these these vectors come from what

207
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,010
because I'd want to make Unix so to

208
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,680
understand how short is the generator we

209
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,450
find we need to understand how precisely

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,490
we can actually solve this instance of

211
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:03,880
the closest with the problem okay so

212
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:05,500
this is for the part dealing with ideals

213
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,620
that our principal so that have a

214
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,600
generator what about the general case

215
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,550
now you're supposed you're given an

216
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,840
arbitrary idea so it's not principal it

217
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,090
doesn't have a generator you cannot be

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,340
looking for a full generator we're going

219
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,229
to find a short vector in this ideal how

220
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,909
fruit well the same quantity with here

221
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,320
the length of the shortest vector and

222
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,280
here the approximation factor we're

223
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,260
trying to reach and to do this the idea

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,559
is to reduce again to the principal case

225
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:36,520
and so what is done in crime rate out

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,098
2017 is you find a small idea will be

227
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,370
such that the product a B is principal

228
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,680
so since B is small this product a B is

229
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,140
in some sense close to a it's 8 and

230
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,620
something small and it's principal so we

231
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,910
call a be a close principal multiple

232
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,339
once you have that you use the previous

233
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,120
part of what I presented and you find a

234
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,010
short generator

235
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,010
this principle ideal a B and this R or

236
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,970
generator is also a short vector in a ok

237
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:09,910
so how do we find these principal these

238
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,470
are close principal multiples first you

239
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,000
have to transform again your problem

240
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,470
into a lattice problem I'm not going to

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,820
be very precise here but just to give

242
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,010
you a rough idea of what are the main

243
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,050
steps we first need to solve an instance

244
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,900
of the discrete logarithm problem in the

245
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,229
class group of our ring in order to

246
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,199
represent our ideal a as a point in some

247
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,400
lattice L the lattice L represents the

248
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,770
points on the lattice represent some

249
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,020
ideals and we want to find to which

250
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,189
point of this lattice a corresponds do

251
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,770
this with a discrete logarithm

252
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,540
computation once you've done that you

253
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,810
can look at the sub lattice of L which

254
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,120
corresponds to principal ideals so P is

255
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,619
a sub lattice of L and it includes

256
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,839
principal ideals and since we are

257
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,270
looking for a close principal idea to a

258
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,700
it's only natural to try to solve the

259
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,520
closest Viktor problem with respect to

260
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,750
this point a as a victor of the lattice

261
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,790
l and the sub lattice of principle idea

262
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,470
so you again reduced to solving an

263
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,870
instance of the closest victor problem

264
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,959
you're going to find a victor in P so a

265
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,940
principal idea that is close to a and

266
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,680
again you have to wonder can we solve

267
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,330
this process Viktor problem again it's

268
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,520
supposed to be difficult if you don't

269
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,050
know enough about your lattice well it's

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,350
been shown that you can you can solve

271
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,060
the CVP using the sickle Birgit here and

272
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,160
spread a pretty old theorem that allows

273
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,959
you to build a good basis of the

274
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,300
so-called Stickle Burgesses which is a

275
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,209
sub lattice of this lattice P encoding

276
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,740
principal ideals and this basis is good

277
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,390
enough to allow to solve the closest

278
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,920
vector problem with good enough

279
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,080
approximation factor and this is the

280
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,180
result of her I thought 2017 and again

281
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,800
to understand how short all the vectors

282
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,239
that we find we need to understand how

283
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,109
well we can solve this instance of the

284
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,660
closest vector problem so yeah how sort

285
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,170
of the vectors that we find I already

286
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,420
told you right I mean we find vectors of

287
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,339
this Euclidean norm where here is the

288
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,800
shortest vector that could be found and

289
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,070
here is the approximation factor that

290
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,649
were trying to reach but this is not

291
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,660
actually

292
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,029
satisfying and the reason is simply this

293
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,680
big oh here it doesn't with this bigger

294
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,879
here we don't know much about what's

295
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,979
actually happening with concrete

296
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,329
parameters worse than that the bigger is

297
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,579
in the experiment so it has an enormous

298
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,439
impact so we're trying to understand

299
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,290
what are the hidden constants in there

300
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,029
and try to derive from that when these

301
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,480
algorithms start outperforming the

302
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,980
classic methods lll and bkz so we can

303
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,449
try to do that by simulating the

304
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,249
algorithm we ran the algorithm and we

305
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,109
see how what's the quality of the output

306
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,759
and we compare that to what could have

307
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,079
been done with a la Loba kisi the

308
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,759
problem is that these algorithms or

309
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,170
Quantum's and we cannot actually run

310
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,149
them and we need to find a way to

311
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,790
simulate them without having a quantum

312
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:49,100
computer so let's let's identify the

313
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,868
quantum steps so here's a summary on the

314
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,029
algorithm as i already told you we start

315
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:54,410
by solving an instance of the discrete

316
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,329
logarithm problem in the class group

317
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,829
this should already tell you that you

318
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,989
need a quantum computer to do that a

319
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,550
class loop is a pretty big group you

320
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,899
don't know much about it even computing

321
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,519
its structure if I was a quantum

322
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,309
computer if you want to work in

323
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,839
polynomial time once you've done that

324
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,089
you need to solve an instance of the

325
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,790
closest vector problem in the sticker

326
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,559
burger lattice to find a small vector a

327
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,929
small ID will be such that Abe use

328
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:21,319
principle so here it can be done

329
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:23,569
classically it's an instance of CVP and

330
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:27,199
this step is essentially the closest

331
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:29,269
principle multiple problem once you've

332
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,029
done that the third step is to find an

333
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:35,059
arbitrary generator of this principle

334
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:37,610
ideal a B this again you need a quantum

335
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,199
computer it might not be as obvious as

336
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,449
when you see this people algorithm but

337
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,870
trust me to find an arbitrary generator

338
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:47,959
if you want to do it in polynomial time

339
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,860
you will need your quantum computer then

340
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:53,239
finally to find a short generator so G

341
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,160
is an arbitrary generator and to find a

342
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,779
short one you need to solve a closest

343
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,230
vector problem this time with respect to

344
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,240
the logarithmic unit lattice and then H

345
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,519
is your output okay so we have these two

346
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,559
annoying quantum steps and then to

347
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,720
understand how short the output is you

348
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,059
need to understand first how small is

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,819
this ideal B that you find and stepped

350
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:16,040
you and how short is the generator H

351
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:18,170
that you find in step 4 so how do we get

352
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,150
rid of these quantum steps well we're

353
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,589
going to do something very trivial we

354
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,140
just assume that their output is

355
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,580
uniformly distributed now that sounds

356
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,680
like a really strong assumption but this

357
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,630
can be made rigorous actually by just

358
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,400
rear-end amazing their outputs every

359
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,080
time you have a quantum step you take

360
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,760
itself but Yuri randomized it to make

361
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,860
sure it's uniform you solve the

362
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,060
classical step and then you D randomized

363
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,740
to make sure that you got the correct

364
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,140
result and then we can always assume

365
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,900
that the classical steps have an input

366
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,790
that is uniformly distributed this can

367
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,040
be done rigorously more or less by

368
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,099
studying random walks in the class group

369
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,660
things like this okay so we can remove

370
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,700
these quantum steps and replace them by

371
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,850
random Oracle's that just give you

372
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,470
random outputs and then see what it

373
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,310
what's happening with the closest vector

374
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,870
steps so we have two CVP instances in

375
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,339
step two with respect to the stickler

376
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,710
burger lettuce in step four with respect

377
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,710
to the logarithmic unit lattice these

378
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,750
lattices we know explicit short basis

379
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,340
for them so we can actually experiment

380
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,440
with them we can run numerical

381
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:24,800
simulations and we can prove theoretical

382
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,120
lower bounds so here our results the on

383
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,439
the horizontal axis you have the

384
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,780
dimension of the lattice that you're

385
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,460
working on and on the vertical axis we

386
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,620
have a measure of the quality of the

387
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,950
output it's the route hermit factor it's

388
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,380
not exactly the approximation factor it

389
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,570
is essentially the approximation factor

390
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,460
raised to the power 1 over the dimension

391
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,990
of the lattice choosing this route

392
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,610
hermit vector allow us to have

393
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,890
horizontal lines for the classic

394
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,070
algorithms so here this line for

395
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,439
instance written lll says that in

396
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,980
whatever dimension you achieve a return

397
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,810
a factor of about one point zero to two

398
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,250
it doesn't mean that I will give you as

399
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,229
good of an approximation in the in

400
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,910
dimension because remember that this

401
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,110
quantity is raised to the power 1 over

402
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,730
the dimension ok then all they are there

403
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,220
are horizontal lines are bkz for

404
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,570
different block lengths so the bigger

405
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,220
the block length the cost of the

406
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,550
algorithm but the better the quality of

407
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,920
the output in blue here you have the

408
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,780
results of simulations for a plane

409
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,680
implementation of the quantum algorithms

410
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,790
so naive implementation meaning

411
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,219
implemented just as described in the

412
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,769
articles the original articles without

413
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,250
to do any kinds of optimizations and the

414
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:39,439
red lines are the same algorithms but

415
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,240
with a number of heuristic improvements

416
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,029
for instance instead of just using a

417
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,040
short basis of the basis of the lettuces

418
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,959
we are looking at we exploit the fact

419
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,209
that we don't only know a basis but we

420
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,008
know a very large set of road vectors

421
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,810
the number of short vectors we know in

422
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,639
the lettuces that were working with is

423
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,619
much larger larger than the dimension

424
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,319
and we can exploit that using

425
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,329
appropriate CVP algorithms and this is a

426
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,310
very worthwhile improvement because as

427
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:08,269
you can see the red curve is way better

428
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:12,199
than the blue curve now here the brown

429
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:14,300
curve is a theoretical limit a

430
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,339
theoretical lower bound on what could be

431
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,560
achieved by this family of algorithm

432
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:23,420
assuming that you have a perfect CVP

433
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,290
solver so these blue and red are

434
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,029
actually numerical simulations using

435
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,550
state-of-the-art algorithms for solving

436
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,420
CVP and the brown line assumes that you

437
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,099
have a perfect solver so it shouldn't be

438
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,128
possible to go below these brown lines

439
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,579
if we stay within the same realm of

440
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:45,410
algorithms so the interesting points in

441
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:47,930
this race are the crossover points with

442
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:52,579
the classical algorithms for instance if

443
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,649
you look at B key Z 120 and 160 which

444
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:57,410
are essentially the limit of what's

445
00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,009
achievable today 120 is feasible in a

446
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,389
few days 160 is it's probably feasible

447
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:06,709
if you're extremely rich and you have a

448
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:08,630
little bit of time what we can see is

449
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,000
that our heuristically improved

450
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,179
algorithm will not give better results

451
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
than these until dimension about 6000

452
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:19,069
for context I think the largest

453
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,559
dimension of a cyclotomic ideal lattice

454
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,539
that appears in the next competition is

455
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,049
about 1,000 so this is an order of

456
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:29,299
magnitude bigger and then if you worried

457
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,639
about what could be possible in the

458
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,530
future if we have very good CVP solvers

459
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,820
you can look at the brown line and you

460
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:40,760
can see that it won't cross bkz 3300

461
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,090
until also dimension about 6000 because

462
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,820
e300 is

463
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:49,110
the first security level in Venice

464
00:17:44,820 --> 00:18:02,010
competition okay so these are the

465
00:17:49,110 --> 00:18:14,280
references I used we have a few minutes

466
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:17,010
for questions okay I'll ask one can you

467
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,670
comment on the difference between the

468
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,440
actual instances of ideal SVP that you

469
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,990
were studying here and the ones that and

470
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,420
and the kinds of problems that appear in

471
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:30,330
cryptographic systems what are the

472
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,140
differences yeah so in the numerical

473
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:37,580
simulations that they showed here one

474
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,580
difference is that we are looking at

475
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,110
cyclotomic fields of prime conductor

476
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,510
whereas usually you would use as

477
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,610
economic fields of power of a power of

478
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,710
three conductor the reason we do that is

479
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,139
that so we still study the case of power

480
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,910
of two but it's not this graph and the

481
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,350
reason is that power is off to are way

482
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:03,030
too sparse to get good extrapolations of

483
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,740
what you'll get you get here what are

484
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,360
the differences I don't know the

485
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,590
dimension is obviously way bigger than

486
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,540
what you would actually find in practice

487
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:16,409
in this tale at least well my question

488
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,800
is are our ideal lattices in cyclotomic

489
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,900
number fields actually appearing in

490
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,610
proposed crypto systems yeah VP wouldn't

491
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,700
actually break the crypto systems for

492
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,100
many reasons first moose crypto systems

493
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,690
actually rely on the prom on problems

494
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:42,250
that are supposedly stronger like I

495
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,250
ringg lwe or whatever and this is just

496
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:48,620
if you can solve this it doesn't mean

497
