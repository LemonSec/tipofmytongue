1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,440
great thanks around and thanks everyone

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,389
for coming so the context of this talk

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,879
is the landscape of cryptography from

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,440
one-way functions so famously in

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:17,150
Pagliacci oh and Looby showed that

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,650
one-way functions are necessary for

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,990
essentially all of complexity based

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,340
cryptography and on the other hand the

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,470
beautiful series of warts have shown

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,330
that in fact it suffices for a large

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,250
number of cryptographic protocols and

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,779
applications including for example most

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,970
of private key cryptography and also

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,570
some basic public key primitives like

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,760
digital signatures and the way these

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,499
constructions of these more more useful

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,969
primitives and protocols work is that

18
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,230
they don't actually work directly with

19
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,269
one-way functions which are very

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,398
unstructured and hard to manipulate for

21
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:50,358
for a construction they instead deal

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,889
with with loops with elements of this

23
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,409
bottom layer here which are sort of more

24
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:55,879
structured primitives that are easy to

25
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,399
use in constructions and easy to reason

26
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,649
about and they thereby isolate the need

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,519
to deal with one-way functions and that

28
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:07,420
hardness to this bottom layer of

29
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:10,820
reductions and it's this bottom layer

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,860
that we're going to focus on today so a

31
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,079
recent line of work has been dedicated

32
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,640
to trying to get simpler more efficient

33
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,820
constructions of these basic more

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,009
structured primitives and along the way

35
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,559
it's shown sort of surprising

36
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,240
similarities behind the constructions

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,039
and the analyses of these seemingly very

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,658
different primitives and it's raised

39
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,009
sort of the very intriguing possibility

40
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,530
that there may be a way to formally

41
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,109
unify the constructions or the analyses

42
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,390
but so far this dream is still far out

43
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:40,270
of reach so in this work we make a

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,789
little bit of progress in this direction

45
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,289
by introducing a new framework to reason

46
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:48,170
about and manipulate the hardness of

47
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,820
one-way functions in the way that's

48
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,679
needed to get both statistically hiding

49
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,369
commitments and pseudo-random generators

50
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:56,630
from one-way functions and say a little

51
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:58,159
bit more about this what this means we

52
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,589
first need to understand a bit about how

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,149
these constructions work and they go via

54
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,479
manipulating different computational

55
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,859
analogues of entropy so first a brief

56
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,770
reminder and the information theoretic

57
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,600
setting what is entropy the Shannon

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,610
entropy of a random variable a is just

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,609
the expected surprise the expected log

60
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,950
one over the probability and really the

61
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,530
only thing we need to know is

62
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,019
for an n-bit string the entropy of a

63
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,670
random variable a is between zero in the

64
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,490
case that a is just a point mass input

65
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,989
solids mass in one point or n where a is

66
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,370
the uniform distribution over all n bit

67
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:35,140
strings so now let's understand these

68
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,910
primitives of pseudo-random generators

69
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,208
and statistical heading commitments from

70
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,440
the sort of entropy theoretic view

71
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,030
so most basically a pseudo-random

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,520
generator let's just say is a function

73
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,890
from n bit strings to two n bit strings

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,290
now the Shannon entropy of the output of

75
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,488
the pseudo-random generator is at most N

76
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,079
and this is just for trivial reasons the

77
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,280
input is an N bit string has entropy at

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,830
most N and you can't increase the

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,030
entropy by applying some function but on

80
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,070
the other hand from the point of view of

81
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,540
a computationally bounded adversary the

82
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,090
whole point of pseudo-random generator

83
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,739
is that the output looks uniform so in

84
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,100
some sense the the computational a

85
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:15,269
pseudo entropy of the output is as if G

86
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,250
of v1 was full head full entropy and

87
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,420
this what this means formally is that

88
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,860
there is some distribution X

89
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,119
computationally indistinguishable from

90
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,430
the output of the pseudo-random

91
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,380
generator that does have true Shannon

92
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,610
entropy to N and this of course is the

93
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,530
famous notion of pseudo entropy

94
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:33,730
introduced in the seminal work of Hassad

95
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,590
in Puglia to 11 and Looby and something

96
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,420
to know here is that like in this case

97
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,060
the distribution n is simply the uniform

98
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,950
distribution on to n bits and so a

99
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,570
pseudo n pseudo-random generators sort

100
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,280
of a maximal form of a generation of

101
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,750
pseudo entropy not only is the sooner to

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,340
be more than the true meant to be n it's

103
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,660
actually as large as it possibly could

104
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,670
be and it turns out there's a dual way

105
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,959
to think about this in the context of

106
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,679
say a statistically hiding commitment

107
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,150
based on unforgeable ax t so to say what

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
this means let's think of a statistical

109
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,600
hiding commitment of a message drawn

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
uniformly at random from n bit strings

111
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,840
and where you execute the commitment

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,149
protocol you get some transcript T now

113
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,920
by the statistical hiding property of

114
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,079
this commitment the entropy of the

115
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,310
message given the message M given the

116
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,049
transcript tree is supposed to be

117
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,070
completely uniform or statistically

118
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,659
close to uniform because it's

119
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,130
statistically hiding and in particular

120
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,090
the true entropy of the message given

121
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,830
the transcript is essentially n but on

122
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,239
the other hand the binding property of

123
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,949
the commitment

124
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,810
says that the computationally bounded

125
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,150
sender should not be able to decommitted

126
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,310
one message and in particular in

127
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,250
particular miss address they should not

128
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,509
be able to sample any or access any

129
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,479
entropy in the message given the

130
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,220
transcript the sort of computational and

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,568
entropy the entropy left to a

132
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,699
computationally bounded adversary is

133
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:55,360
fact much less than the true entropy and

134
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:58,060
is actually negligible and importantly

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,430
this holds even if the the sender the

136
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,630
committer is malicious and does not just

137
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,490
sample the message uniformly at random

138
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,250
and execute the transcript but instead

139
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,020
executes the transcript and generates

140
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,699
the message sort of simultaneously in a

141
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,539
way trying to access entropy and M given

142
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,250
T the the concept here is that you still

143
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,139
can't do that and this is the recent

144
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,289
notion of inaccessible entropy due to

145
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,330
heightened Arango Vuitton and we and

146
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,280
again much like pseudo entropy here we

147
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,659
see that not only is the computational

148
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,210
entropy sorry

149
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:31,840
much less less than the true entropy it

150
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,250
is in fact zero or negligible so again

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,369
this is sort of an extreme form of an

152
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,690
accessible entropy motivating this it's

153
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,460
perhaps not surprising that the way

154
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,699
these best constructions work now is

155
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,049
they first go and produce some form of

156
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,750
pseudo entropy or inaccessible entropy

157
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,520
that's not necessarily maximal but it

158
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,139
has some gap between the computational

159
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,250
entropy and that your entropy so these

160
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,990
are pseudo n 3 generators and the

161
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,580
accessible entry generators and then you

162
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,080
convert that into the full primitive

163
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:01,210
that you want so it turns out that in

164
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,500
these constructions once you have your

165
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,030
base you don't appear an accessible

166
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,560
entropy generator that has this gap

167
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,809
between computational and real entropy

168
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,580
the step to turn it into a full to full

169
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,380
primitive is actually quite similar you

170
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,150
do some simple things like repetition to

171
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,219
amplify these gaps to turn them from

172
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,508
Shannon entropy term in entropy things

173
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:17,919
like this and then some sort of hashing

174
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,699
or extraction step to get true

175
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,049
randomness which your commitment but on

176
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,789
the other hand the sort of steps to

177
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,409
actually get this first generator

178
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,250
computational entropy generator have

179
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:32,139
been mostly ad hoc and so they sort of

180
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,669
question behind this work and the series

181
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,900
of works is to test try and get a better

182
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:39,940
understanding of whether these things

183
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,320
can be unified and so if we zoom in even

184
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,099
further for getting the eventual

185
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,449
primitives let's look at the

186
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,800
constructions of these computational

187
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,039
entropy generators

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
if we go to 2010 the best horses of

189
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,669
Hytner wrangled in Padang in the in the

190
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,840
cilantro vacations still the same and

191
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,849
accessible on should be generator you

192
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,289
can see here that the constructions are

193
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,630
somewhat similar the the actual

194
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:00,250
generators look somewhat similar but the

195
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,940
techniques are quite different than ad

196
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,639
hoc but now interestingly in 2012

197
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,930
Vedanta and Jiang in work that has the

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,870
best-known pseudo-random generator

199
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,310
construction from one my functions

200
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,169
introduced a new notion of relative

201
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,509
pseudo entropy that allowed them to

202
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,219
basically both simplify the eventual

203
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,660
construction and make it essentially the

204
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,539
same as the inaccessible entropy can

205
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,440
structure but also give like a simpler

206
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:28,030
tighter proof and the key idea is that

207
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,030
this notion of relative pseudo entropy

208
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,429
is a very simple beautiful information

209
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,520
theoretic notion that is easily derived

210
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,289
from one way functions and also it lets

211
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,508
you manipulate sort of this hardness in

212
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,310
a very information theoretic way and

213
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,130
allows you to isolate the computational

214
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,840
part of the proof to just this one step

215
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,460
so in particular like you isolate the

216
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,138
information theoretic and computational

217
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,120
aspects of the proof and you get a

218
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,610
simpler tighter proof of this of this

219
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,229
reduction on the other hand that work

220
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,760
was entirely for pseudo entropy so it

221
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:02,080
left the sort of inaccessible entre pa

222
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,060
leg of this of this diagram unchanged so

223
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,949
in this work what we do is we introduce

224
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,409
a few new notions most importantly

225
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,789
hardness and relative entropy which like

226
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,370
relative pseudo entropy is a very sort

227
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,389
of simple information theoretic notion

228
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,639
that is easily found in one way

229
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,740
functions but on the other hand allows

230
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,180
us both to recover relatives who'd want

231
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,280
to be in the case of student in the case

232
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,090
of pseudo-random generators but also

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,859
allows us to do to make this proof also

234
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,080
inaccessible entropy generated is more

235
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,520
modular simpler slightly tighter and do

236
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,078
most of the work entirely with

237
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,478
information theoretic manipulations

238
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:37,779
isolating again the computational aspect

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,250
to one step and we'll actually see that

240
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,679
in fact a lot of the steps on the top

241
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,779
and bottom will mirror each other but we

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,609
need to first understand a bit more

243
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:50,770
about what these notions actually are so

244
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,750
the preliminary or the talk was had

245
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,740
mentioned KL divergence the new motion

246
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,079
is called hardness and relative entropy

247
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,180
so let's define of course relative

248
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,689
entropy or the KL divergence which is a

249
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,219
four

250
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,920
of distance between probability

251
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,620
distributions so the relative entropy of

252
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,270
a with respect to B is the expected

253
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,340
where the expectation is over the

254
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,500
distribution on the Left relative

255
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,820
surprise of a they expected log ratio of

256
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,790
the probability of a over the

257
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,010
probability of B and just some for

258
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,449
intuition some basic properties the

259
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,439
relative entropy is non-negative with

260
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,550
equality if and only if the

261
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,050
distributions coincide the relative

262
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,790
degree is finite if and only if the

263
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,650
support of a is contained in the support

264
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,260
of B or another way to think of this if

265
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,660
a ever puts mass on an element where B

266
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,630
is 0 have as no mass then the divergence

267
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,300
of relative entropy is infinite and for

268
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,280
intuition if B for example is uniform

269
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,540
over its support then the relative

270
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,260
entropy of a with respect to B is

271
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,180
minimized

272
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,640
when first the support of a is contained

273
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,989
in the support of B but then also the

274
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,790
support of a should be as large as

275
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,230
possible within that set and it should

276
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:59,530
be as close to uniform on that support

277
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:01,390
as possible ok so and also just very

278
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,550
briefly a one-way function more for

279
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,710
notational purposes is just a function f

280
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,180
computable in polynomial time such that

281
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,700
the prop for any polynomial time

282
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,829
adversary the probability of inverting a

283
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:16,090
uniform image of the one-way function is

284
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,560
negligible ok so now before we talk

285
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,120
about the new notion of partisan

286
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,400
relative entropy let's first understand

287
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
the vz-- notion of relatives to do

288
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,439
entropy that they used for pseudo

289
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,090
entropy generators so that we say that X

290
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,730
a distribution X is relative pseudo

291
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,410
entropy Delta given f of X if for all

292
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,910
polynomial time adversaries a the

293
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,740
relative entropy of the Joint

294
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,079
Distribution of the input X and the

295
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,720
image F of X with respect to the

296
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,089
adversary run on f of X and f of X is at

297
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,950
least Delta so that was a lot of words

298
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:46,690
let's try and understand a little bit

299
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,130
more briefly notice that the second

300
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,950
component here the f of X component is

301
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,550
the same so this this divergence has

302
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,350
made 0 if the adversary a in fact

303
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,530
samples exactly from the premature

304
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,390
person of X given f of X and on the

305
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,120
contrary this dish this relative entropy

306
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,160
will be large if the support here is

307
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,690
much smaller than the support here or in

308
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,319
other words if a puts a lot of mass

309
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:15,310
outside a pre-image of F or so

310
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,870
if a fails to invert that so given this

311
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,880
intuition it's not surprising that VZ

312
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,529
proved that in fact if F is a one-way

313
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,439
function then the uniform distribution

314
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,560
has real has super logarithmic relative

315
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,829
pseudo entropy given given the image and

316
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,359
now I was normally step so like very

317
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:33,310
clean-looking theorem will have a very

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,019
ugly proof because we were dealing with

319
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,160
one-way functions but one Beauty at one

320
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,990
beautiful thing or this notion is that

321
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,660
in fact I'm going to give the proof on

322
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,940
this slide

323
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,170
so the key is that the relative entropy

324
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,970
is very nice to work with and

325
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,399
particularly we have the data processing

326
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,560
inequality which says essentially that

327
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,540
the relative entropy is non increasing

328
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,750
under the application of a function to

329
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,370
both sides of the divergence so what

330
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,290
function are we going to apply we're

331
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,209
just going to ask the first component of

332
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,529
this Joint Distribution a pre-image of

333
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,130
the second under the one-way function

334
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:08,230
and when we do this we see that in fact

335
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,540
on the left-hand side by definition the

336
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,250
first component is always a pre-image

337
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,019
but on the second side by the one-way

338
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,690
function property because an adversary

339
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,180
can invert only negligibly it's only

340
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,980
negligibly often at a pre-image and thus

341
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,510
this this relative entropy is super

342
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,649
logarithmic in fact it's the log of the

343
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,880
security parameter of the one-way

344
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:30,220
function like 1 over the security

345
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,160
parameter ok so this talk is about

346
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,690
unifying the entropy so how are we going

347
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,250
to try and put in excess of elantra P

348
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,190
into this framework of relative pseudo

349
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,779
entropy so first let's remember that

350
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,819
relatives aren't free we see it has this

351
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:44,380
one verse 3 a here on the right-hand

352
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:46,750
side of the of this of this relative

353
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,300
entropy and its purpose is to invert the

354
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,720
one-way function but on the other hand

355
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,040
for inaccessible entropy the adversary

356
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,500
is really not an inverter

357
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,410
it's a malicious generator or sampler

358
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,300
and to explain what I mean by that let's

359
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,269
recall this example of a statistically

360
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,439
hiding commitment in which a sender is

361
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,750
supposed to choose a uniformly random

362
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:12,550
message execute the protocol and get a

363
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:15,160
transcript T the security notion we want

364
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,560
to look at is a malicious adversary

365
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,069
which is not just doing this process but

366
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,719
is somehow

367
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:23,769
jointly executing the protocol and

368
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,030
sampling m TN m in such a way that they

369
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,070
want to access more ndred

370
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:31,600
in their adversarial message until they

371
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,250
given the transcript e-tilde the binding

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
property we want is is sort of

373
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,880
quantified over all these malicious

374
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,380
generators or samplers and saying that

375
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,610
you no matter what you do if you're

376
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,530
still poly time bounded you can't

377
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,840
actually access any entropy in the

378
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,610
message given the transcript even if you

379
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,230
maliciously try and execute the sampling

380
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,100
process so our goal is to sort of

381
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,800
capture

382
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,920
now the hardness of maliciously sampling

383
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,780
this pair X tilde Y tilde supported on X

384
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,069
Y going back to the one-way function

385
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,270
example we're trying to get inaccessible

386
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,710
entropy out of the one-way function and

387
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,180
so the first and most natural attempt

388
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,840
perhaps is to look at the relative

389
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,819
entropy of this output distribution of

390
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,150
the maliciously sampled X tilde Y tilde

391
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,680
with respect to the true X Y and we'd

392
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,550
like to say something like this is large

393
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,819
for any polynomial time sampler

394
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,550
unfortunately this is not true in fact

395
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,810
the divergence is zero for the simplest

396
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,000
thing you can do if you're just honest

397
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,060
then you just pick our uniformly random

398
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,320
X execute f of X and by definition sort

399
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,770
of this distribution will be the same as

400
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,930
the one on the right and the problem

401
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,430
here is that this this entry or this

402
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,589
relative entropy isn't capturing the

403
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,420
sort of usefulness of the generator it's

404
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,130
not capturing the fact that it's not the

405
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,839
output necessarily that's weird it's

406
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,630
it's the it's the guts of the sampling

407
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,620
process it's it's it's it's this doesn't

408
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,500
care for the usefulness or the

409
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,630
maliciousness of the generator so the

410
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,970
key idea is sort of we're gonna look not

411
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,020
just at the input of the sampler we're

412
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,270
gonna look at the randomness of the

413
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,550
sampler but to do that we need to

414
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,500
accompany the sample or by some sort of

415
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,479
simulator and what that simulator is

416
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,310
going to do is given an arbitrary image

417
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,260
of the one-way function its goal is to

418
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,170
generate compatible coin tosses for the

419
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,819
sampler in the sense that given why I'm

420
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,260
my simulator is supposed to abuse

421
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,760
randomness for the jeta sampler or a

422
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,520
generator then when you generate back

423
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,280
you get back Y and then we're going to

424
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,840
compare the uniform random miss used by

425
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,730
the generator in the sort of forward

426
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,750
direction and the random miss you you

427
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,370
get from the simulator and so let's try

428
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,300
and both be a little bit more rigorous

429
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,459
and you

430
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,130
some pictures so we start we're just

431
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:44,229
with the one-way function f that map's X

432
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,010
to Y and we're going to introduce two

433
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,589
adversaries the first is this malicious

434
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,649
sample or generator G tilde which Maps

435
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,649
randomness to a joint distribution of X

436
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,970
tilde Y tilde in such a way that it's

437
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,529
consistent with the one wave function

438
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,790
meaning that Y tilde is always equal to

439
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:05,680
f of X tilde and now the simulator

440
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,250
talked about we introduced as a second

441
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,410
adversary that goes from Y back to our

442
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,360
in such a way that if you follow the

443
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,890
diagram from lidar to back you should

444
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,810
get back to where you started or perhaps

445
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,370
the some special special fail symbol if

446
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:23,018
the simulator isn't able to accomplish

447
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:25,240
its task and now with this model in

448
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,060
place we can define our main notion of

449
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,950
hardness and relative entropy and say

450
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,380
that this joint distribution X f of X

451
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,930
has harness and relative entropy Delta

452
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,060
if for all polynomial time adversaries G

453
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,229
and s of this form the relative entropy

454
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,219
of the randomness used by the generator

455
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,310
uniform randomness used by the generator

456
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,620
and the output image of the one-way

457
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,410
function with respect to the sampled

458
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,550
random simulated randomness given a true

459
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,689
one-way function output and the true

460
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:57,459
one-way function output is large so

461
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,649
again this is just a lot of notation to

462
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:04,889
unpack this will be made 0 if both this

463
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,839
generator G tilde is able to perfectly

464
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,600
approximate the distribution of Y as as

465
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,698
we've seen and also it's the simulator

466
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,859
is able to perfectly sample from the

467
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:19,630
randomness used conditioned on getting

468
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:22,329
the output Y so a little bit more

469
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,250
intuition first let's note that if we

470
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,139
look at the example that defeated the

471
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,630
earlier first attempt where we just

472
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,730
consider the honest sampler that picks X

473
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,950
uniformly at random and it computes f of

474
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,230
X we recover exactly the notion of

475
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,100
relative pseudo entropy defined by

476
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,960
Vardhan and ring because here we will

477
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,418
just get that the randomness is the X or

478
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,160
the Y tilde is f of X and if you just

479
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,169
replace Y with f of X this is exactly

480
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,080
exactly what we wrote down for relatives

481
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:51,220
didn't want to be but on the other hand

482
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,928
we also have not

483
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,059
realize too far like we haven't given

484
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,409
the adversary too much power because if

485
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,149
F is a one-way function then in fact

486
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,860
this joint distribution still has

487
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,270
hardness and relative entropy at least

488
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,949
super logarithmic and enter and again

489
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,200
log this one over the security parameter

490
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,120
and the proof is still one line and it

491
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,980
is essentially the same as the

492
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,418
peripheral tip pseudo entropy the key

493
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,600
thing to note is that esepcially if you

494
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,460
take Y simulate the randomness and

495
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:25,408
sample X you have inverted the one-way

496
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:27,730
function if you succeed okay so I

497
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:30,520
finally let's talk a little bit about

498
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,929
this picture now so we've gone through

499
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:40,510
what hardness and relative entropy is

500
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:42,309
we've defined it and now and now let's

501
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,309
look at this diagram that shows these

502
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:48,340
steps you get to get pseudo entropy and

503
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,379
inaccessible entropy unfortunately I

504
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,850
don't have time to go in detail about

505
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,320
these steps I recommend you take the

506
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,780
paper if you're interested but what I

507
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,668
want to point out is that in fact these

508
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,610
steps between the two the two branches

509
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:03,220
are actually quite dual to each other as

510
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,389
we mentioned if you start with hardness

511
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,039
and relative entropy and you fix the

512
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,600
generator G tilde to be this honest

513
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,539
sample or you immediately recover

514
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,070
relative pseudo entropy and then if your

515
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:13,539
goal is to obtain the sort of next block

516
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,399
so do entropy it turns out the step next

517
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:17,559
step you do is you you sort of make this

518
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,809
adversary online in some way and make

519
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,970
some sort of block wise and split into

520
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,730
some sort of block wise notion with

521
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,530
primarily information theoretic

522
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,480
considerations and similarly here you

523
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,039
again do most of your manipulation

524
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,020
information theoretically you just swap

525
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,720
the order a bit you first make your

526
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,450
generator online and then fix not the

527
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,190
generator but the simulator again I

528
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,440
don't think I can convey too much other

529
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,570
than these steps if you look at them are

530
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,820
actually extremely natural in the

531
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,270
context of once you have this hardness

532
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,710
and relative entropy notion and are very

533
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,070
sort of dual and similar to each other

534
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,510
and yeah and sort of gives this one step

535
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,840
towards unifying these enterpise and

536
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,690
perhaps even later the constructions are

537
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,850
more of the analysis so I'd like to

538
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,229
conclude with just some future research

539
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,320
directions

540
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:09,639
first the if you recall this bottom

541
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
layer of primitives in the diagram at

542
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,238
the beginning there was also a universal

543
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,739
one we hash functions it would be nice

544
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:16,840
to be able to use this notion or

545
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:18,190
something like it to also lead more to

546
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,449
get more efficient constructions of

547
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,249
wolfs

548
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,629
in fact the best-known difference of

549
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:24,460
wolfs does go by some slightly different

550
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,259
notion of an accessible entropy so

551
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,929
there's hope that this may also be able

552
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:32,200
to unify that one as well but more

553
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:34,299
broadly I think the sort of key idea

554
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,559
here was this using relative entropy or

555
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,450
KL divergence for just information

556
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,830
theoretic notions in general as a way to

557
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,359
sort of capture the hardness and

558
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,728
cryptographic primitives and reductions

559
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,619
and you know that's in a way that's very

560
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,359
simple and in particular very much

561
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,099
isolates the computational and

562
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:52,299
information theoretic parts of these

563
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:54,639
reductions and with that yeah so I hope

564
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,499
I hope that may be useful in

565
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,979
cryptography and with that I'll conclude

566
00:20:56,499 --> 00:21:05,400
the talk so thank you

567
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,400
[Applause]

568
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:19,789
great thank you

569
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:19,789
questions okay thank you again
