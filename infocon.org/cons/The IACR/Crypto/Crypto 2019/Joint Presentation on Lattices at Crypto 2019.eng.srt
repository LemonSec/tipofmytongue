1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,840
thank you very much yeah so as was

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,259
already said this is going to be a joint

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,930
talk about two papers which are very

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,310
similar in techniques and therefore it

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,700
makes sense that they were soft merged

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:25,238
and basically the plan is that I will

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,049
give a very high-level introduction into

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:31,360
the topic and the techniques and then

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,980
roping will take over in the second half

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:47,079
and give one of the protocols and also

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:49,390
applications of okay so our papers are

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,239
concerned with as you knowledge proofs

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,850
for latest cryptography and in this area

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,129
basically the main problem that one

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,140
wants to solve is proving a short

16
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,329
solution to a linear equation so this

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,420
means there's some public matrix a and

18
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,740
some public right hand side we and the

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,490
program wants to prove that he knows the

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,669
short vector W such that a a times W

21
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,160
equals we and yeah maybe the simplest

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,050
example of this which maybe should also

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,420
convince you that someone natural

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,840
letters problems can be phrased in this

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,110
way is proving knowledge of an lwe

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,720
secret and therefore I've put this

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,580
example on the slide so there you see

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,370
that for example such an AW secret you

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,580
can write in this matrix vector form and

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:40,810
the secret vector will then just consist

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,370
of the W secret and the error and I

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,290
should also say that we are basically

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,030
interested in really concretely

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,300
efficient protocols

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,160
so really protocols where the proof size

36
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,509
is measured in kilobytes and for this

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,509
reason it makes sense to locate ring

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:01,180
based at least for this talk to focus on

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,100
rig based yeah problems so if now the

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,230
goal is to prove such an equation really

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,109
exactly and in particular this means

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:12,670
that the solution you can extract from

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,370
some prover is as short as the solution

44
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,459
some the owners prove a at least really

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,050
knows

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:24,740
then until basically this yeah basically

47
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,710
this year the only proof system for this

48
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,400
were the so called strength improves and

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,920
unfortunately they are very inefficient

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,780
so for example for this ring lwe case if

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,880
you prove this exactly with a stone type

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,910
strain type proof system then your proof

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,670
size is a couple of megabytes large and

54
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,400
in our papers with our techniques we can

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,890
basically improve on this by about it

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,990
sector by about an order of magnitude so

57
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,250
proving such an earring at the sample

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:00,680
now takes a couple of hundred kilobytes

59
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:04,060
yeah before yeah before I give a

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,220
high-level overview of our techniques I

61
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,390
want to also mention other systems but I

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,730
think you have also seen this in the

63
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,850
talk before so maybe I try to go very

64
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,760
quickly here so because these stone type

65
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:20,359
proofs have been so inefficient there

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,370
has been a lot of yeah other basically

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,480
other proof systems developed which

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,680
prove slightly relaxed statements and

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,070
more efficient than stir and hi proofs

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,710
and the most important example are the

71
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,810
so-called approximate proofs and these

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,480
proofs what you do there is that over

73
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,090
what they achieve is that the vector

74
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,799
they prove is significantly longer than

75
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,010
the one that proved really knows and

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,960
also the equation is perturbed by some

77
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,660
by some small polynomial on the right

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,030
hand side but still for some

79
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,920
applications this is enough and the most

80
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,540
most important example are signature

81
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,309
schemes so for example the delisting

82
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,400
signature scheme in the nist competition

83
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,080
this is based on such a proof and you

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,900
can really get down to for example in

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,450
the case of the lithium to 2.7 kilobytes

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,930
but yeah for some applications this is

87
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,690
just not enough then then the so-called

88
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,459
amortized proofs where you prove many

89
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,930
equations at once if you happen to have

90
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,479
many questions if you want to prove and

91
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,919
then amortize over all of them they also

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,090
extremely efficient and different to the

93
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,430
approximate proofs they don't have this

94
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,340
annoying somehow perturbation factor on

95
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,290
the right hand side

96
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,159
what they still have is that they are

97
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,200
not exact because the the basically the

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,780
vector the proof is much longer than the

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,550
one the proven knows and then last but

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,549
not least what you also can do is you

101
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,110
can transfer or transform your latest

102
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,940
equation to something which is amenable

103
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,800
to discrete log based proof systems for

104
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,900
example bullet proof and then prove them

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,570
with the bullet proof if you are fine

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,150
but because some of us being based on

107
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,750
discrete log okay so much for this

108
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:06,210
introduction now to give a high-level

109
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:10,169
idea how our exact proof system works we

110
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,060
maybe look at approximate proofs and

111
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,609
basically one of the main steps in these

112
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,460
proofs is that the prover sends some

113
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,190
masked secret of the masked version of

114
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,770
the secret so if if W is one of the

115
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,140
secret polynomials inside this vector W

116
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,930
then what the prover sends is basically

117
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:33,419
some challenge polynomial alpha times W

118
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:36,419
plus some masking polynomial and yeah in

119
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,669
the case of approximate proofs now what

120
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,680
you do is you choose alpha to be a

121
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:43,530
really small polynomial and then alpha

122
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,120
times W is small and then with the help

123
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,729
of a technique which is called rejection

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,860
sampling you can also only take the

125
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,359
masking polynomial to be quite small and

126
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,900
then the verifier can basically infer

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,550
something about the secret polynomial

128
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,229
about the size of the secret polynomial

129
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,450
from the size of the mask version of it

130
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,229
this is how these approximate proofs

131
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,909
work what we do differently is that we

132
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,140
actually prove that the secret

133
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,330
polynomial inside the masking is it's

134
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,479
short or more precisely that really all

135
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:18,180
the coefficients of the polynomial they

136
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,700
lie in some small interval and yeah the

137
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,200
simplest case is that we prove that all

138
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,110
the coefficients are binary so they're

139
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,210
either 0 1 yeah

140
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,700
standard technique to prove something to

141
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,419
be 0 1 you prove that it's solution to

142
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,010
the polynomial x times 1 minus X and for

143
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,479
the polynomial to now prove that really

144
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,099
all the coefficients are 0 1 what you

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,140
need to do is you need to prove that the

146
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,539
point wise product or the proficient

147
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,820
wise product of the polynomial W

148
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,790
and the polynomial where you flip all

149
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,219
the bits which is the old one polynomial

150
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,080
minus W at this point best product is

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,380
zero and if you now look at this

152
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,859
equation and basically replace W by our

153
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,670
mask version of it and now also somehow

154
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,020
restrict our challenges to not be

155
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,960
arbitrary polynomials but that's really

156
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,180
only integers in the Q then we see that

157
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
we get an equation which on the

158
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,860
left-hand side is some quadratic

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,400
point-wise product and on the right hand

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,500
side is a polynomial where basically the

161
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,510
term we are interested in appears at the

162
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,930
at the leading is the leading

163
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,870
coefficient and this gives us a strategy

164
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,030
to prove that this basically that is

165
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,010
secret inside the math secret is small

166
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,349
and namely we basically only have to

167
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,719
convince the verifier that the math

168
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:41,190
secret is of the correct form so it's

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,540
really like our plus alpha x times the

170
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:48,570
secret and that in this quadratic

171
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,920
point-wise product there is no crediting

172
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,380
term so this leading order term vanishes

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,960
and the difficult part is to basically

174
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,690
prove this in VO knowledge and before i

175
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,729
explain how this works i want to do two

176
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,410
observations or maybe three first since

177
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,830
we now have these coefficient wise

178
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,800
products this is not really compatible

179
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,599
anymore with polynomial products that we

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,490
want to have for at least in the

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,680
approximate proofs we have for for the

182
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,450
challenge polynomial and so on this is

183
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,130
why in the slide before I basically said

184
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,530
we have to redo basically restrict two

185
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,330
to integer challenges and this is bad

186
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,460
because the reason why the the

187
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,710
approximate proofs are so efficient is

188
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,200
because they can use polynomial

189
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,990
challenges now if you cannot do this

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,598
anymore at least what we want to do is

191
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,820
we want to choose the challenges from

192
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,330
all of the Q's that basically have as

193
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,610
large a chance pass as possible but then

194
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,920
we also need a uniform masking

195
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:52,320
polynomial and this as basically the

196
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,829
from this follows that the simple

197
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
technique in the approximate proof

198
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,330
to to prove they're detectives of the

199
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,010
correct form by just giving out a times

200
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,430
are is not enough anymore because this

201
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,709
does doesn't find the this polynomial I

202
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,109
anymore this part of the approximate

203
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:13,300
proof see or they have to change so yeah

204
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,950
we achieve all this by using basically

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,189
some sort of homomorphic commitment

206
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:21,220
scheme and what we need is a commitment

207
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,339
scheme where it is possible to compute

208
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,890
basically linear expressions over our

209
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,019
ring are inside the commitments so

210
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,810
basically given two commitments to treat

211
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,550
messages that the verifier doesn't know

212
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,920
he needs to be able to compute a new

213
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,430
commitment to some linear expression of

214
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,620
the messages and if we have this and

215
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,849
also a proof to prove that there some

216
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,480
commitment is actually commitment to

217
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:50,230
zero then we can we have a tool to prove

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,110
linear or linear expressions in inside

219
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,720
commitments and then in the knowledge

220
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,720
and to give an example how this works

221
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,990
yeah yeah and so I said we need to prove

222
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,640
that that is of the correct form and if

223
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,730
this is somehow no more complicated than

224
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,029
in the approximate proofs and what we do

225
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:20,910
is that the prover gives our commitments

226
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:24,430
to to to the mask in polynomial and to

227
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,860
to to the secret and then he proves that

228
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,349
this linear combination of the two

229
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,670
commitments is actually a commitment to

230
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,829
to the mask secret to that this is yeah

231
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,779
the first part and then now to really

232
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:41,199
prove that the that the secret is year

233
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:44,170
one remember that we had this quadratic

234
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,219
point-wise relation right on on the

235
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,800
right hand side there was this

236
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,199
polynomial in alpha and we were only

237
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,810
interested in the in the leading term so

238
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,849
we basically commit to these lower order

239
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:58,569
terms that that we call gavage terms and

240
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,459
then prove that already basically this

241
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,450
linear polynomial with coefficient these

242
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,910
commitments is is a commitment to

243
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,680
this quadratic product so this basically

244
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,209
means that there is no quadratic term

245
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,170
meaning that this vanishes what we

246
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:15,630
wanted to prove actually so in BAU in

247
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,569
our paper there's a slightly different

248
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:23,550
technique I think I now have to be very

249
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,530
quick to explain this so what what we

250
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,420
already have in the proof is that that

251
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,970
the prover gives out some some

252
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,849
commitment to the to the to the secret

253
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,560
because we needed this for this to prove

254
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,680
that the mass secret is of the correct

255
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,130
form and this means that in this for

256
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,520
drastic relation where we had specified

257
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,170
twice the mass secret we can use that

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,699
the actual secret once and then only the

259
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,500
the mastic but only wants and to do this

260
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,210
directly what we would need especially

261
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,370
the commitment scheme very quickly two

262
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,530
point five products but our commitment

263
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,640
scheme doesn't support this and what we

264
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:06,990
use as basically as a method to to still

265
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,699
do this is we use the fact that the

266
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,490
entity of of a polynomial product

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,740
translates to a quantized product in the

268
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,270
entity domain and then with this trick

269
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,910
you can basically prove that if the

270
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,790
entity of some credit ik polynomial

271
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,880
product that they are in the leading

272
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,189
term an expression evolves which which

273
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,310
shows that the entity of our secret

274
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:35,900
polynomial is zero

275
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:35,900
yeah if this I hand over to ya roping

276
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,010
hi I'm Roopa and the we'll finish the

277
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,470
remaining part of this talk

278
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:58,400
greg has just showing how to construct

279
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:01,900
their knowledge argument okay a curb has

280
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:06,290
- learn how to construct an argument for

281
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,959
Lin equations is a binary solution where

282
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,189
rough idea and next I will talk about

283
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:15,640
how this idea can be extended to prove a

284
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,700
much wider lattice Basin relations

285
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:23,600
okay who's their work and our aims to

286
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:27,410
Churchill so standard rezones and high

287
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:34,040
efficiency simultaneously okay let's

288
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:36,260
start with our main protocol the main

289
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,040
religion considering its work is Lin

290
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,610
equations with kinetic or with quality

291
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,740
constraints over its witness in fact in

292
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,250
particular the proven needs to prove

293
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,810
that he knows secret reputable you the

294
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,810
map Deseret here

295
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,650
satisfy a linear equation a double

296
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,430
equals way and a quadratic formula f

297
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:04,670
double equal zero and here for simple

298
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:08,630
city we considered simplified instance

299
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:12,079
were W it's all history and that the

300
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:18,020
critic formula is W equals W times W

301
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:20,690
story okay so to prove this our son

302
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,360
point is a standard as no protocol you

303
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,310
know latex based set here this is

304
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,740
perfect to prove the Lin equation part

305
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:34,790
but heard nothing about as a practical

306
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:39,410
strength so to protect in part okay so

307
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:41,930
to prove the second part we'll all the

308
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,839
reasons that after receiving the

309
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,120
response today the warfare is able to a

310
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,070
computer the total military and what

311
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,620
have the alpha and the difference

312
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,940
between the two products is the linear

313
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,250
in alpha

314
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,330
and only if WI equals double to

315
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,880
habitable story so if we can reduce the

316
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,940
problem of Akio critical constraints

317
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,830
into the problem our cue that they took

318
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,170
the to this room as they were alpha

319
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,890
which is Dino City here is indeed a

320
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:17,839
linear in alpha so to prove this we

321
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:21,500
can't commit the coefficients and send

322
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,410
since the commitments he and the CP to

323
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:30,410
the welfare and then the project is our

324
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:34,100
C + V is a commitment of T this team to

325
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:37,280
work if the commitment scheme is Homo

326
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:43,970
fake but it requires that the revenues

327
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:47,839
used to commit T it is it is equal to f

328
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:51,940
IC plus SP so next we will require the

329
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:55,310
prover to send the crack revenues to the

330
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,860
welfare and the welfare check will check

331
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:01,310
the quality out comments using this

332
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,650
crack run days the included here will

333
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,319
hold if the commitment scheme is the

334
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:10,100
homologous with respect to addition and

335
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,460
the multiplication by a constant so the

336
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:18,890
Sun is is currently in part partially

337
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:21,140
partially revisions but but partially

338
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,350
revealing the RAM is our government made

339
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,930
a fact is hiding property and that will

340
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,610
comprise the general property of the

341
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:35,359
whole protocol to analyze to analyze why

342
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:37,790
this to analyze why this does not accrue

343
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,430
because we consider concrete commitments

344
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,579
game they weren't originally Papa may at

345
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,329
all his commitment scheme the runways as

346
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,730
is sampled from a constitution and it

347
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,670
can be proved that if we reject sampling

348
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,250
all the Romneys the correction with s

349
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,459
there's a whole protocol is the other an

350
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,490
origin one problem of this communal

351
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,680
scheme and all-knowing all-knowing let

352
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,109
his best communal scheme is that it is

353
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,928
only homo fig with less

354
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,000
to multiplication in Palermo constant so

355
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,689
here instead our sampling are far from

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,439
secure we will sample it from if he were

357
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:22,610
Pittsburgh number okay this isn't part

358
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,799
of our and protocol our the full

359
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:28,129
protocol also includes some exterior

360
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,980
commitments and some octillery proofs

361
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,980
but they are all mated from this talk

362
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,979
note that our protocol camp referred

363
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,168
through the lineage in part where a

364
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,299
standard snore protocol and can

365
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,549
perfectly prove the quality constraints

366
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:49,309
where argue linear equations ordered

367
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,290
compliments so at he so it achieves a

368
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,480
stand rezones

369
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:56,120
also if p is not too small in this basic

370
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,720
protocol will only repeat a few times

371
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,770
rather than 200 times to achieve

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:09,650
negligence on the s so this error so it

373
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:11,950
can't you have officially say okay this

374
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,950
is

375
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:47,379
okay okay okay with automation we just

376
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,990
talked about our main protocol and next

377
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,550
we will see how our men protocol can be

378
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:58,780
used to prove a pool three different and

379
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,419
the commonly used let his religion first

380
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,030
we will see how to prove Lin equations

381
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,040
with short solutions here for simplicity

382
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,928
was to set the boundaries her plus one

383
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:14,110
is a power tool and to prove this we

384
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:16,600
first of all those that I need heater a

385
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,809
is bounded if and only if it can be

386
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:25,360
decomposed into a pan reactor or pontil

387
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:28,149
length so in the first step we will

388
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,909
decompose the vector W into a pan-arab

389
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:34,679
double Prime and through that this pan

390
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:39,070
director set afire a new linear addition

391
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,870
to prove that double prime is a band

392
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,970
reactor we rely on the following

393
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:46,689
observations that I mean he drew a is

394
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:49,630
Valerie if and only if is s father to

395
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,540
eighth grade was a so in the next step

396
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,590
we will prove that double up from is

397
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,260
binary we a cue that wi prime equals WR

398
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,809
m x double prime so in this way we can

399
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,929
transform the whole religion into a

400
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:09,970
linear equation and a heretic constraint

401
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:12,330
over its witness okay so this is exactly

402
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:15,720
what can be proved by our main protocol

403
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,720
okay next

404
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:46,040
there is also some trouble okay okay

405
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:55,380
thank you okay next we will talk about

406
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,250
how to process time or memory in

407
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,580
equations

408
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,540
here's the business here HBR is a beta

409
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:06,060
and is used to select each AR WI and the

410
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,690
task is to preserve the sum of the stock

411
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,149
selected yeah W R equals we for

412
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,270
simplicity here we consider a simplified

413
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:23,010
example that I am equal to and each

414
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:26,400
table is always one to produce okay to

415
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,930
prove this let WI prophecy copy our

416
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,160
table realizing we contrast from the

417
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:35,190
first equation into a standard standard

418
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,370
linear yishun and the correctness of

419
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:41,430
each table from and the fact that each

420
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,250
BR is binary can be argued that we're

421
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,650
currently a constraint so again we know

422
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:54,120
how to prove this from our main protocol

423
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:56,370
okay next we will see how to prove

424
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,229
linear chains with hit matrix here the

425
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,679
protocol should protect boosts the

426
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:04,170
matrix a and direct wo and for

427
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,650
simplicity here we can assume that a is

428
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:12,450
two by two matrix and to process that

429
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:14,970
you are J equals a rj x WJ and it can be

430
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:18,150
very easy to see that we went because

431
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,690
you are n plus 1 2 and with we caused

432
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:24,380
you to 1 plus u 2 2 so we can transform

433
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,540
this in equation with hid matrix into

434
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,220
linear equation with a public matrix

435
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,120
also criminalist

436
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,240
of each you are Jake and

437
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,239
our code will cross a constraint so

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,790
again we know how to prove this to

439
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,590
summarize from our main protocol we can

440
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,500
construct their knowledge arguments for

441
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:50,020
surety different and bicicletas

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:53,130
relations and next we will see how this

443
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,379
general argument can be used to

444
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,090
construct real-world applications here

445
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,230
we will not go stab into Lotito

446
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:07,899
construction and only kill preferred map

447
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:10,929
and some results first as transmission

448
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,920
as transmission from our main protocol

449
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,860
we can construct their knowledge

450
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:19,690
argument for some basic registrations

451
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:23,229
and then from this learners arguments we

452
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:26,410
can construct the real argument for some

453
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,360
cryptographic primitives for example

454
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,600
prove knowledge or plain text for police

455
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,979
game and for some of these cryptographic

456
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,689
schemes for example accumulator or PRF

457
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,700
we currently we only know how to

458
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,160
construct their knowledge arguments for

459
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,900
them from a standard protocol and our

460
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,750
work saw this proper all next from from

461
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,740
suitable lattice Beechcraft graphics

462
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:56,590
game and and there are no arguments for

463
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,540
them we can construct Caprice prism

464
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,970
primitives that are used in real world

465
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,290
applications including risky true

466
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:09,160
signature electronic cash and run truth

467
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:13,030
if we said if we set the concrete

468
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:18,280
parameters of our schemes suitably

469
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:20,470
we found that scheme from our solution

470
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,600
are much more efficient result from a

471
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,630
student hub protocol but is less

472
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,199
efficient that schemes from Offutt

473
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,830
Ramirez world protocol but we stress

474
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,309
that we don't use optimization such as

475
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,030
structural lattice and double

476
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:42,820
application traffic specific

477
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,360
optimizations and we believe that the

478
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,020
efficient could correct

479
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,229
improve if we use these optimizations

480
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,139
okay

481
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:57,650
that's how second for attention and okay

482
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:00,650
okay and I will pass away I will get my

483
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,770
50 credits December and there will be a

484
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:06,570
supporter market today if you are

485
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:17,290
interested please contact me thank you

486
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:17,290
[Applause]

487
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,460
could you go back to your main protocol

488
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,460
sorry could you go back to your main

489
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,260
okay okay so this I think this is this

490
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,490
hole called binary proof and this has

491
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,440
been known for a few years in the

492
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,030
discrete logarithm setting animal was

493
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,250
extent of the lattice setting last year

494
00:25:52,030 --> 00:26:00,310
what's the difference of this protocol

495
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,660
versus the previous ones yeah

496
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,340
you know what's your new technique in

497
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,750
this protocol versus the previous one

498
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:10,990
okay the Meher the main difficulty is to

499
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,140
prove that a vector is small in previous

500
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:16,660
stroke or tacos they used small of oh he

501
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,420
said awesome small for example are a

502
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:23,800
small alpha and they check every is more

503
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:26,710
right but I think the previous protocols

504
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,110
can still prove that the is in the

505
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,170
secret that we have is binary so you are

506
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,790
proving that it's short from the

507
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:38,670
previous protocol says yeah

508
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:43,690
pi cracker no it's not by great

509
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:46,690
increased protocols they told okay they

510
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,370
don't use the little tacky or linear

511
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,570
relations over the compliments

512
00:26:48,370 --> 00:27:00,489
so actually we don't know how to prove

513
00:26:52,570 --> 00:27:04,840
that the witness is binary we haven't

514
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:09,010
seen that maybe if you say okay if we

515
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,189
can use the proofing so let me set here

516
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:18,420
this is possible but we don't know how

517
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,420
to make it in details okay

518
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,629
