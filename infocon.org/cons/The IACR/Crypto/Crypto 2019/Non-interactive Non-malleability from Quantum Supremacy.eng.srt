1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,500
so hi everyone I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,719
this work on building non interactive

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,439
non malleable commitments from quantum

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,869
supremacy what I want to talk about

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,270
today is how we make use of quantum

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,610
hardness assumptions to get better

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,340
results for classical cryptography which

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,649
is a technique using a technique that we

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,260
believe is interesting and new and I

10
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,910
also so we use it to build non

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,629
interactive non valuable commitments

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,429
like I said and we also use it or more

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,860
generally it can be used to replace

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,360
quantum hardness so it can be used to

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,310
replace complexity leveraging with

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,870
quantum hardness in many situations and

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,010
I hope to convey that to you today

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,099
focusing on non interactive non

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,110
malleable commitments let me let me

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,340
start by quickly recalling what a

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:05,700
commitment is so a commitment is a is a

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,460
primitive that allows Alice who has an a

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,880
secret input m to put this input in a

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,990
box

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,580
lock the box and send it over to Bob and

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,490
the requirement is that this box should

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,500
not reveal the messaging unless Alice

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,330
provides a key in the future that allows

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,150
Bob to check that the message inside

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,979
this box was indeed M and we require

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,390
that at this later point

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,880
Alice shouldn't be able to change her

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,740
mind about the message in the box what

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,890
actually happens in the protocol world

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,630
is that Alice and Bob either

36
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,930
interactively or non interactively

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,619
generate a transcript this serves as a

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,180
commitment to Alice's input and later on

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,040
Alice sends some D commitment

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,080
information that allows Bob to check

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,500
that the committed value was indeed this

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,710
message and what we will care about in

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,170
this talk is non malleability which is a

44
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,600
which is a stronger requirement which

45
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,180
requires that any adversity that has

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,699
access to this commitment string should

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,780
not be able to change the string in some

48
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,760
way or Hammer the Box metaphorically to

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,719
come up with a commitment to a related

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,179
message so note that this is stronger

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,850
than hiding because the it's possible

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,220
that there exists

53
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,049
schemes that hide the message em but

54
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,150
there are ways to manipulate the string

55
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,370
so that you generate a string that

56
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,880
commits to a related message without

57
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,190
knowing what this message is at all and

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,049
that's what we want to avoid so more

59
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,750
specifically the situation we want to

60
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,040
consider is the following there are

61
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,330
three parties Alice Mallory and Bob

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,570
Mallory is expecting a commitment from

63
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:50,320
Alice and Bob expects a commitment from

64
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:53,320
Mallory but what if Mallory turns evil

65
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,810
and instead of generating her commitment

66
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,120
honestly she takes the string she got

67
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,000
from Alice tampers with it in some way

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,200
and uses the resulting string as her own

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,550
commitment to Bob so this is what we

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
want to avoid and what do I mean by

71
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,680
avoiding this we want to guarantee that

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,470
the value X that is committed by Mallory

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,640
is independent of the value a that Alice

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:21,700
was committing to and there's been a lot

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,339
of work trying to build commitments with

76
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,179
such guarantees they've unfortunately

77
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,000
mostly been interactive and there's this

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,580
whole sequence of work very recently

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,180
there were two works two concurrent

80
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,130
works one of which got to around non

81
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,900
malleable commitments which means which

82
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,320
adds a message to the interaction

83
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,310
pattern that I that I have here from

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,250
some exponential time log puzzles and

85
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,750
sub-exponential DDH and so we now have

86
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,590
two round commitments from

87
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,960
sub-exponential standard assumptions

88
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,540
however the more interesting question

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,860
has been can be build non interactive

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,620
non malleable commitments from

91
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,690
well-studied assumptions and the reason

92
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,400
that a completely non interactive non

93
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,470
malleable commitments are interesting is

94
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,060
because they don't require any

95
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,830
back-and-forth so they don't require

96
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,010
anyone to wait for the other party to

97
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,930
respond and they can be written down so

98
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,510
they can be broadcast on a ledger they

99
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,490
can be stored for future use they can be

100
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,860
relayed or transferred from one person

101
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,590
to another and that's what's really

102
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,260
exciting about the non interactive

103
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,099
version of this primitive

104
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,780
and towards answering this question

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,030
there was a work of pon de Paz and where

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,340
Kunta Nathan that showed that if one

107
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,919
assumes the existence of what are

108
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,869
adaptive or non malleable one-way

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,020
functions which is a very strong

110
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,640
assumption on one-way functions then

111
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,299
indeed non malleable commitments that

112
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,719
are non interactive do exist

113
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,030
subsequently there was another work of

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,500
actually 10 years later in a year ago

115
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,140
there was a work of Bataan Ski and Lynn

116
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,110
that showed that if one assumes time

117
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,539
lock buzzes and sub exponent shil

118
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,100
keyless and compressible functions which

119
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,050
are similar in spirit to the keyless

120
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,330
multi collision resistant hash functions

121
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,860
that some of you may have heard about

122
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,690
yesterday so with those types of

123
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,040
assumptions one can actually build non

124
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,420
interactive non malleable commitments

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,220
however these are not very well studied

126
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,520
assumptions so can we do better in terms

127
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,890
of assumptions and the the work that I'm

128
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,950
going to talk about today answers this

129
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,919
question partially and says that indeed

130
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,810
one can assume well studied standard

131
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,390
quantum and classical hardness

132
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,830
assumptions and some exponential

133
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,320
versions of those assumptions so

134
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,099
specifically we rely on quantum hardness

135
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,620
of lwe

136
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,270
and classical hardness of factoring and

137
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,070
non interactive witness

138
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,750
indistinguishable proofs and we show

139
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,940
that if you assume some exponential

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,790
hardness of all of these primitives then

141
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,810
indeed then indeed non interactive non

142
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,900
malleable commitments are possible so

143
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,100
before going on to our construction let

144
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,929
me let's go back to the definition and

145
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,420
try to understand what it means to say

146
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,280
that the value X committed by Mallory is

147
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,730
independent of the value a that was

148
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,010
committed by Alice so what we want to

149
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,050
intuitively say is that Mallory's

150
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,060
behavior is independent of Alice or

151
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,990
independence stuff even the existence of

152
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,270
Alice so how do we how can we formalize

153
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,280
this well one way to do it is the

154
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,289
following let's imagine another

155
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,140
experiment where instead of committing

156
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,570
to her input Alice in this other

157
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,370
experiment just committed to zero so

158
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,860
Alice's input didn't even exist in this

159
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,080
other

160
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,720
experiment and now let's look at the

161
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,599
distribution of values why that Mallory

162
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,130
commits to in this other experiment if

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,080
we can guarantee that the distribution

164
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,850
of X in experiment one is

165
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,700
indistinguishable from the distribution

166
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,870
of Y in experiment 2 then that means

167
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,219
that X is essentially independent of a

168
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,140
because X is indistinguishable from y

169
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,030
and Y is independent of a because the

170
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:16,550
second experiment is independent of

171
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:18,349
Alice's input a so so that's that's what

172
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,600
we will strive that's the definition we

173
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,730
will strive to achieve and towards

174
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,470
achieving it let me start with a very

175
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,110
simple construction in a simplified

176
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,750
setting so let's assume that there are

177
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:35,480
only two entities in the world Alice and

178
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:38,210
Mallory and we will and we will assign

179
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,980
to Alice a commitment that is going to

180
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,320
be quantum secure so this is going to be

181
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,110
an lwe based commitment that that will

182
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,969
be press that is conjectured to be

183
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,550
secure in the presence of quantum

184
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,370
polynomial-time adversities at the same

185
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,100
time - Mallory we will assign a

186
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,650
commitment that is quantum insecure but

187
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,990
classically secured so no classical

188
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,960
adversary can distinguish commitments to

189
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,760
sum to input X from commitments to zero

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,440
however quantum adversary's can actually

191
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,420
break this commitment and find out the

192
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,840
value that was committed okay so this

193
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,630
construction is binding and hiding

194
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,729
according to the definitions of binding

195
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,320
and hiding that I informally talked

196
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:29,750
about before is it non manual to answer

197
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,730
this question recall that we need to go

198
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,789
back to the game with two experiments

199
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,860
and argue that the distribution of X in

200
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,679
experiment one is indistinguishable from

201
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,039
the distribution of Y in experiment two

202
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:47,930
when Alice just commits to zero how can

203
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,969
we argue this well there exists so so

204
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,099
looking at these experiments if one

205
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,090
takes the transcript of an execution of

206
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,710
either experiment 1 or experiment 2

207
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,250
given a quantum computer it's possible

208
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,620
to find out what x and y

209
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,750
and the reason is that we started with

210
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,790
commitments for Mallory that were

211
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,980
quantum extractable in polynomial time

212
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,949
that were extractable in quantum

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,350
polynomial time so a quantum computer

214
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:15,389
given such a transcript can find out

215
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,480
what x and y are and if they are

216
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:20,689
different then we've built a quantum

217
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,490
machine that actually distinguishes

218
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:27,569
Alice's commitment to a from Alice's

219
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,759
commitment to 0a so let me let me say

220
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,920
that again slowly the man-in-the-middle

221
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,709
mallory together with a quantum computer

222
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,949
is now a quantum polynomial time

223
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:40,529
adversary that is able to decide between

224
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:45,779
whether it is in experiment 1 or

225
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:48,209
experiment 2 and that's and so if x and

226
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,889
y are distinguishable we have a distinct

227
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,810
we have a quantum polynomial time

228
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,759
distinguisher that breaks hiding of

229
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,649
alice's commitments and this shouldn't

230
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,639
be possible because alice's commitments

231
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,050
were quantum secure and so the

232
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:06,029
distributions of x and y must

233
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:08,729
necessarily be indistinguishable moving

234
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:11,220
on this was the case when mallory was

235
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,100
malicious what if alice and manually

236
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,559
mallory switch rose and alice becomes

237
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,300
the bad guy now note that we had a

238
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,430
commitment for alice that was quantum

239
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,500
secure and one for Mallory that was

240
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,290
quantum extractable and this guaranteed

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,300
that Mallory's message M is going to be

242
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,759
independent of Alice's message X but not

243
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,529
the other way around so how do we

244
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,100
guarantee security in this reverse

245
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:38,040
situation we will well we will rely on

246
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,290
complexity leveraging now what that

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,170
means is we will take Alice's commitment

248
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,579
the that so recall that Alice's

249
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,800
commitment is quantum secure and

250
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,410
Mallory's commitment is quantum insecure

251
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,469
but in addition to being quantum secure

252
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,050
we will make alice's commitment a quasi

253
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,730
polynomially at extractable so

254
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,329
extractable in classical

255
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,750
quasi-polynomial time and this can be

256
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:06,029
done by relying on say the the l w

257
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,670
assumption and at the same time

258
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,920
Mallory's commitment will be set so that

259
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,170
it's sub exponent surely secure against

260
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,060
classical adversary's

261
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,740
can be done by building a commitment

262
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,160
that's a non-interactive commitment

263
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,470
that's based on some exponential DDH so

264
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,540
Alice's commitment will satisfy both

265
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,990
properties of being quantum secure and

266
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,240
yet

267
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,389
classically quasi polynomially insecure

268
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,880
and Mallory's commitment will be quantum

269
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:36,690
insecure but classically more secure

270
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:41,399
than Alice's commitment and by doing

271
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:43,320
this going back to to analyzing non

272
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,149
malleability for the situation where

273
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,290
alice is malicious we will see that

274
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,029
again given a transcript of this

275
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,519
execution there exists a

276
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:55,680
quasi-polynomial time extractor that is

277
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,649
able to look at this transcript and find

278
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,019
out what x and y are and if x and y were

279
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,850
different in both games then this would

280
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,800
be a quasi-polynomial extractor that

281
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,190
distinguishes experiment one from

282
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,540
experiment two which means that alice

283
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,820
together with the quasi-polynomial time

284
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,319
machine are a quasi-polynomial time

285
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,510
breaker for Mallory's commitment and

286
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,820
this would be a contradiction which is

287
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,800
why which is how we will argue that it

288
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:27,390
is non malleable even in case alice

289
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,149
becomes malicious so by the same logic

290
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,730
is before and at the end we have a pair

291
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,920
of commitments where no matter who the

292
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,620
bad guy is these commitments are non

293
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,849
malleable with respect to each other and

294
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,040
Alice cannot Maul

295
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:46,440
Mallory's commitment and manually cannot

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:49,769
maul Alice's commitment so now - ok and

297
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,660
these are just to recap Alice's

298
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,130
commitment is based on quantum

299
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,670
polynomially secure and quasi

300
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,709
polynomially extractable commitments and

301
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,329
Mallory's is called quantum polynomially

302
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,939
extractable but sub exponentially

303
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,500
classically secured at the same time so

304
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,760
these are two commitments that differ

305
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,100
from each other across two different

306
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:16,790
axis of hardness one is harder than the

307
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:16,790
other across one axis and so going up so

308
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,810
just a second yeah so we have we have

309
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,339
now two commitments for two identities

310
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,260
that are non malleable with respect to

311
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,089
each other but what if there are more

312
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,040
than two identities in the world

313
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,680
in cryptography protocol and we want to

314
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,370
argue that every identities committed

315
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,430
value is is not is independent of values

316
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,749
committed by other identities so so we

317
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,519
would like to generalize to this

318
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:43,800
identity based notion of commitments

319
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,639
where the adversary can pick any

320
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,709
identity that is n bits long and the

321
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,509
honest party can pick any other identity

322
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,920
that is n bits long and as long as the

323
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,959
adversary's and honest parties

324
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,399
identities are different we still want

325
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,869
to have this independence guarantee and

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,269
this is this it turns out that this

327
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,360
generalized identity based notion for

328
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:08,610
identities of size n is identical to the

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,470
most general notion of is equivalent to

330
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,389
the most general notion of non malleable

331
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,970
commitments assuming the existence of

332
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,029
signatures and I don't have time to go

333
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,120
into why so you just have to believe me

334
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,189
on that but I do want to spend some time

335
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,259
on explaining how we achieve this more

336
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:29,248
general definition for exponentially

337
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:31,709
many identities towards that we first

338
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:35,249
have a construction for identities that

339
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:37,199
are that are in C log log n for a small

340
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,389
constant C and then we have an

341
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,240
amplification step that helps us amplify

342
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:44,189
the space of identities exponentially

343
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,089
many times to go all the way to

344
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:53,370
identities into today let me start with

345
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:55,499
the first step so to get a commitments

346
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,629
that are secured for non-manual

347
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,970
commitments that are secured for C log

348
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,970
log n identities we will start with the

349
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,009
technique of pass and V who who said

350
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,589
that it is essentially possible to use

351
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,170
complexity leveraging to get a sequence

352
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,029
of commitments a C log log n in number

353
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,579
that are progressively harder than

354
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:18,779
harder than the other and what I mean is

355
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,519
that in classical time t1 the commitment

356
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,290
with identity 1 is secure whereas the

357
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,749
commitment for the identity 2 can be

358
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,879
broken and then the commitment with

359
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:29,189
identity 2 is secure for some other time

360
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,230
some smaller time t2 whereas the

361
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:33,629
commitment with identity 3 breaks down

362
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,699
at this time and as a result the

363
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,500
sequence of commitments gives us a

364
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,359
sequence of non valuable commitments

365
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,740
that are non valuable whenever the

366
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,500
honesty I didn't

367
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,140
is smaller than the adversary's identity

368
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,000
by the exact same logic as before you

369
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,310
can break the adversary's commitment and

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,960
extract his value and if this is

371
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,939
correlated with the Honest parties

372
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,410
committed value then you have a

373
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,580
distinguisher for the honest party

374
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,529
commitment so it better not be

375
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,270
correlated so so we have the sequence of

376
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,279
commitments that are progressively less

377
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,649
secure in the classical world we will

378
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,779
build another sequence of commitments

379
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,880
that are progressively less secure both

380
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,100
in the quantum and classical worlds by

381
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,439
relying on some exponential quantum

382
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,779
hardness of an assumption like lwe or

383
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,839
LPN or any lattice based assumption and

384
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,060
so in a quantum setting this means that

385
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,310
we have a sequence of commitments where

386
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,949
the last commitment is the most secure

387
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,109
one and therefore again by the same

388
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,750
logic these are secured whenever the

389
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,430
adversary's identity is smaller than the

390
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,560
honest parties identity which is the

391
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,989
opposite of the of what we saw in the

392
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,119
previous slide so now we have two

393
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,740
different sequences of commitments one

394
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,990
is secure when the adversary chooses an

395
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,880
identity that's larger than the honest

396
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,830
party identity and the other is secure

397
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,600
when the adversary chooses an identity

398
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,140
that's smaller than the honest party

399
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,230
identity now we need to combine these in

400
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,850
some way to ensure that we have

401
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,250
commitments that are secured whenever

402
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,189
the adversary chooses any identity that

403
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,689
is either bigger or smaller or basically

404
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,650
any identity that's different from

405
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,990
honest parties identity to do this we

406
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,730
will arrange the two sequences of

407
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,370
commitments that we had so far in

408
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,290
decreasing order of security so that all

409
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,479
the quantum secure commitments or the

410
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,520
lwe based commitments will be less

411
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,090
secure than all of the discrete log

412
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,410
based commitments in the classical world

413
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,899
so what I essentially mean is we will

414
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:38,190
set security parameters so that they

415
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,960
decrease in the in this direction what

416
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,970
that gives us is a sequence of

417
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,670
commitments that are progressively less

418
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,780
secure in in this direction in the

419
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,250
classical world on the other hand in the

420
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,500
quantum world all of these are broken

421
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,400
and they are progressively less secure

422
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,520
in the

423
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,260
direction in the quantum world and how

424
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,510
do we use that to argue non malleability

425
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,120
or first how do we construct non

426
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,860
malleable commitments out of this so

427
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,739
let's do this with an example let's say

428
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,719
Charlie has identity 3 what he will do

429
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,700
is he will look at both commitments

430
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,980
corresponding to identity 3 in the

431
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,420
sequence so one is the discrete log

432
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,300
based commitment and the other is the

433
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,520
lwe based commitment and he will split

434
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,800
his message into two parts into two

435
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,139
parts using two out of two secret

436
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,669
sharing scheme he will use the discrete

437
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,930
log based commitment to commit to the

438
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:32,610
first part and the lwe based commitment

439
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,220
with identity 3 to commit to the second

440
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:39,629
part that constitutes a commitment for

441
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,850
identity 3 and why is this not malleable

442
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,040
so let's do this again with an example

443
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,770
let's say we have Alice and Charlie who

444
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,720
have identities 1 & 3 respectively and

445
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,100
you'll see that this is quite this is a

446
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,720
very general example you could just

447
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,760
place two identities anywhere in the

448
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,470
system and we want to argue that they're

449
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,980
both non malleable with respect to each

450
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,320
other so how would we do that

451
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,480
let's say charlie is the bad guy we want

452
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,120
to argue that the message committed by

453
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,400
charlie is independent of the message

454
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,159
committed by Alice the reason for that

455
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,570
is that these commitments are arranged

456
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,550
in order of decreasing classical

457
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,710
security which means that the commitment

458
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:21,480
on the top left of the slide is the most

459
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:26,790
secure one and what this what this means

460
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,250
in what this means now is that the value

461
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,010
committed by Alice using the commitment

462
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,170
on the top left of the slide is secure

463
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,480
even in time that's sufficient to

464
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,000
extract both the shares of Charlie's

465
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,340
commitment which means that Charlie's

466
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,100
values M 1 and M 2 are jointly

467
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,050
independent of one of the shares of

468
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,060
alice's commitment which in turn means

469
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,560
that the message M committed by charlie

470
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,950
is independent of the message L

471
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,960
committed by Alice so that's straight

472
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,460
forward in this direction what about the

473
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,220
other direction so what about the case

474
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,220
when Alice is the bad guy now note that

475
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,650
in the presence of a quantum computer

476
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,190
the the discrete log based commitments

477
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:10,070
break down completely in Paula can we

478
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,310
in polynomial time and we arrange things

479
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,050
so that the lwe based commitments are in

480
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,440
decreasing order of quantum security

481
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:22,370
from Charlie to Alice what this means is

482
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,290
that it's possible to break the to break

483
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,159
all commitments except the one on the

484
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:32,030
bottom right of the slide in some in

485
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,410
quantum time T and the commitment on the

486
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,620
bottom right corner should still remain

487
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,650
secure and this implies that a1 and a2

488
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,290
are jointly extractable in quantum poly

489
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,330
time T whereas m1 M sorry m2 remains

490
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,940
hidden which means that a must

491
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,010
necessarily be independent of one of the

492
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,660
shares m2 of Charlie's message and

493
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,720
therefore a must necessarily be

494
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,330
independent of the message n so we've

495
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:02,750
been able to argue non malleability in

496
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:04,760
both directions now and I only have one

497
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,580
minute so I'm going to very quickly give

498
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,230
you give you some high-level insights on

499
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,500
how we've managed to amplify this all

500
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:15,710
the way to 2 to the N identities the way

501
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,110
we do that is by showing that it's

502
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,720
possible to non interactively amplify

503
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,270
the space of identity is exponentially

504
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,860
assuming sub-exponential non interactive

505
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:28,520
witness indistinguishable proofs

506
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,060
now amplifying c log log n exponentially

507
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,070
just gives something that looks like log

508
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,540
n to the power some constant which is

509
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,060
not enough so we need to apply this

510
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,730
amplification theorem multiple times to

511
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,830
go all the way to 2 to the N because I

512
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,390
don't have much time to go into this I'm

513
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,429
going to hide all the details of the

514
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,830
construction under the rug and only

515
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,240
mention two features of our construction

516
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,949
so one that this is that this results in

517
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,770
a loss in parameters each time we

518
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,240
amplify and this happens because we are

519
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,310
restricted to the non interactive

520
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,060
setting where we don't really have any

521
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:07,730
techniques to do simulation and the

522
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,770
other is that this only is non malleable

523
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,540
commitments that suffer from a selective

524
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,150
aboard problem which means that the

525
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,830
adversary cannot create commitments that

526
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,990
are valid and at the same time

527
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,389
correlated with the value committed by

528
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,250
the honest party but what he can some

529
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,720
do is create commitments where the

530
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,270
probability that the commitment is

531
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,460
invalid is a function of the message

532
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,780
committed by the honest party so that's

533
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,120
something that we cannot deal with at

534
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,700
the moment and that brings me to the

535
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,399
open problems it would be really

536
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,010
interesting to remove this limitation on

537
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,320
selective abort and get non interactive

538
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,580
non malleable commitments that would so

539
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,379
removing this would result in

540
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,280
commitments that satisfy the strongest

541
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,809
definition that could be interesting and

542
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,610
another open question is whether we can

543
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,860
make them non malleable in the

544
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,270
many-to-many setting which is true for

545
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,010
some of the previous constructions that

546
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:01,429
were from less well studied assumptions

547
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,590
but not true for hours and finally can

548
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,540
we find some other ways in which we can

549
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,389
make quantum assumptions to get better

550
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,309
forms of classical cryptography with

551
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,299
that I'd like to conclude thank you and

552
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,299
I'm happy to answer any questions

553
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:28,170
any questions okay let's thank the

554
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,390
speaker again

555
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,390
