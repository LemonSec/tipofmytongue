1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,889
okay thank you for introduction and

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:15,870
first my oral English is not good or so

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,779
maybe I need a speaker slowly my name is

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:25,320
Leticia I from Cherry's academia of

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,570
sizes so this respect verb is about a

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,879
modular invention hidden long parabola

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,510
and immersive akong conclusion generate

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:40,409
so I will in the darkness file paths so

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,470
the first part I need to introduce the

10
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:49,460
modular invention hidden number problem

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,699
this parabola is per the introduced 2001

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:58,049
Pauline Holloway and how group reduced

13
00:00:52,699 --> 00:01:02,129
this is a broad complicity assumption in

14
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:07,380
order to design in sotas so the random

15
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,090
number generator and a messy code NASA I

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,720
will introduce the definition definition

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,740
is about given prime key consider a

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,000
cigarette alpha alpha is a belong to

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:28,649
prime field P and the given n plus 1 GI

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:34,620
so GI is now under given 1 over alpha

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:38,940
plus TI a must be given MSB in other

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,360
words 1 plus 1 over alpha plus G is on

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,620
Louie

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,490
but given MSB MSB is my most significant

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,720
piece

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:56,699
so our core is recover the hidden number

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:59,070
alpha ok so previous works in Pauline

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,610
Holloway and the hawk graph give the

29
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:08,060
tips analysis about this problem and two

30
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:12,920
pumps was a present were given free

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:16,940
theoretical and also he give conjunction

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,059
mi a champion shot in the heart whenever

33
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,920
the

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:29,700
over lockup she is Muslim 103 then

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:35,970
lingshan it all give a rigorous proof

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:40,369
for the first part okay this paper we

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:45,360
give a new punch this Bank is about her

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:50,220
Theatre overloaded P Madison one over T

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:57,090
plus 1 where T is any given positive

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:02,550
integer so when he is Madison - so our

41
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:06,810
pump is 1 over T plus 1 is more than the

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:13,380
previous bank 1 over 3 in other words we

43
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:20,940
disproved conjecture ok that's that I

44
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:24,810
will transformation this problem this

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:29,010
problem we can omit a millage even that

46
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:33,540
alpha why we need immolate alpha because

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:37,709
alpha is unbound problem alpha supersize

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:42,500
is a similar to P so we need a immolate

49
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:49,850
alpha we can get this shaped equations

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:56,400
where alpha OT p oj c oj is now

51
00:03:49,850 --> 00:04:02,790
excellent x1 xn total and Louie moreover

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:07,920
this is small compared to P so this

53
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:15,510
problem so this parabola could write

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:21,048
this so our new goal is find is recover

55
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:24,690
x o x1 + QX and in Palama x such that

56
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:31,049
the Pumped X is as much as possible

57
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:32,930
what is pumped X X is equal to P over 2

58
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,569
2 th

59
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,810
yes that designer route is route

60
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:46,590
recovered we can recover the hidden

61
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:52,830
alpha so we can serve em H&P moreover X

62
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:58,530
is a bigger and implies data is small so

63
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:01,139
we want to EXCI the big and bigger yes

64
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,198
this paper or we can use that who are is

65
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,960
a the cops with technical the comics to

66
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:11,340
be technical is proposed by cops miss in

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,340
the lighting light history a 19-6 the

68
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,650
this this technical user have many

69
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,039
application such as the creeper the

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,120
lenses RS a sudden random number

71
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:30,060
generator and completion computation had

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:34,229
problem and so on so now i will

73
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,529
introduce the cops mister technical so a

74
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:41,699
reveal this technical we can divide the

75
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:46,139
four steps the first one we can collect

76
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:50,879
the servo polymer such that the designer

77
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:54,810
route is either huge the other route is

78
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:59,719
a common modular route is the step 1

79
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:04,250
step 2 we can construct the next air

80
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:06,960
area is depend on the equation a

81
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,960
coefficient vector of a polynomial least

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,680
this big agus is bumped in bound in

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,318
venue let's three second step three we

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,469
can use the latest reduction algorithm

85
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:26,250
such as IRL so in order to obtain and

86
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:31,189
plus one polynomial such that the

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:34,919
desired root is the common root over

88
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:38,279
over integer over the integer so the

89
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:43,669
last step we can use the global passes

90
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,669
to the compute that desired root

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:54,000
but it's the last step wind either less

92
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:59,880
following assumption sorry this

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,690
assumption is me the idea by the unplan

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:10,139
polymer idea is a dimension 0 it's me

95
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:15,570
this equations roots slumber is a

96
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:19,760
phylite in the pilot so in this paper we

97
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:27,120
justify this the assumption use computer

98
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:31,800
experiments okay the costume is method

99
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,440
or the technical is a corn idea either

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,880
ham for polynomial is a very important

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,320
to this paper yeah to get n plus 1

102
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,550
polynomial we need the following

103
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:52,110
simplified condition this is a

104
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:59,190
determinate air power 1 over dimension

105
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:03,199
air is modem P power T to power D ok so

106
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:07,289
the left side of the condition is me

107
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:14,340
geometric mean of all diagonal of the

108
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:17,510
basis matrix yeah so the polymer whose

109
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:23,580
corresponding diagonal elements is

110
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:27,270
necessary in slalom p2e is called home

111
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,380
for columbia so they're having four

112
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:37,319
polynomial the mall the bank eggs is

113
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:43,669
peak energy and energy why why it works

114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,669
so I need a display the last page so

115
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,860
consider

116
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:56,120
triangle Peck spaces matrix B the

117
00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:00,070
dimension W you to tell me later is a P

118
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:06,380
to alpha times X to beta

119
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:12,200
okay if we and a new linear independent

120
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:16,970
GI into B into B so we can get a new

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:23,149
triangle basis matrix B plus so P plus

122
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:27,800
is a dimension is a tableau plus one if

123
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:33,110
G is a hem for polymer so depressed

124
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:39,760
determinate is equals determine letter P

125
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:45,560
times come I so come is more than C to D

126
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:48,740
to people and the GI we can use this is

127
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,680
the condition we can catch X is more

128
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,110
than this one

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,849
after under the GI we can't get a new

130
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:02,230
pump this is this a new so this is a

131
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:08,660
pump is bigger than this band Y because

132
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:14,899
gamma I is this Muslim p2 t because come

133
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:21,000
i at G is a harmful polynomial so if we

134
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:25,150
can evil way

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,510
I'm I'm polynomial Kim oh sorry

136
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:32,709
this is ahem for polynomial we can cater

137
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:38,110
this but this will be very very big

138
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:45,130
because this is about her exposure about

139
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:53,140
M so we want and M is very very much so

140
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:57,910
let's the I will introduce a work so we

141
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:01,689
end the new and choose T plus one coming

142
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:06,640
for polynomial into into the net is

143
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:11,410
compared to the previous work but the

144
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:19,060
lumber of all polynomials is an choose T

145
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:24,219
plus 1 is 1 plus o 1 it means and the

146
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:28,979
hemp or polymer is a dominant so weight

147
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:32,950
method is a very efficient this is a

148
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:38,500
behind reason so we can carry the new

149
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:44,920
part X is more than P 2 1 minus 1 over T

150
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:47,770
plus 1 this is the imply this band learn

151
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,719
the previous report is X is more than P

152
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:58,170
2 2 over 3 this is bounder so the

153
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:04,000
conjecture context so the loop and is

154
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:12,160
the improved conject so we can give it

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:15,760
an example because this is this is next

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:22,480
week and triangle edges we can choose

157
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:26,350
the 11 polymer where g90 2011 is ahem

158
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,450
for Colombia because his angular is

159
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:33,340
smaller and P 2d

160
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:36,430
he 2d compare

161
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:40,420
the previous twerk can you just the

162
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:47,260
choose the age polynomial he told the

163
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:55,360
Jews that she night eternity 11 so crisp

164
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:57,970
and is a p2 1.3 but the new pant is p2

165
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,990
one point three seven five

166
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:07,600
so the Lubanga is better than the band

167
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:09,220
the reason is come for polymer until the

168
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,860
mind a kiss

169
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:21,070
our ladies sorry so this is a experiment

170
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:26,410
we can verify this we found her we found

171
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:31,170
her the experimental part is a a better

172
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:37,540
path than the theoretical part way to

173
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:40,390
the 100 experiment every time so

174
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:47,020
immersive a conclusion generate is a

175
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:50,980
another problem it's me isn't it given a

176
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:56,880
cigarette cedar will oh-wee oh-wee zero

177
00:13:50,980 --> 00:14:01,510
we can output so the random sequence

178
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:06,580
impress one of the puts in from the a

179
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,530
tank view we can fund we can fund rehab

180
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:14,620
we can recover the seder

181
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:18,900
Mayo given impress one of the pools this

182
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:22,930
problem is also could be translated into

183
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:28,510
this shape this shape column your

184
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:33,370
equations because this shape for your

185
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:37,300
equations is the same shape as mi HMG so

186
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:44,350
we can also use the algorithm to the

187
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:46,370
safe the I CG in short case so

188
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:51,270
conclusion

189
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:55,260
after more than 15 years we improved the

190
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,860
pump for the sale of the mi H&P for the

191
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,240
first time

192
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:08,670
moreover we also obtained to the best a

193
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:17,970
tanker result on the ICG q la thank you

194
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:17,969
[Applause]

195
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,390
two questions really one of them is can

196
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,430
you say a few words of what what are

197
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,800
these helpful polynomials how did you

198
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,930
get them and the second question is is

199
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,579
there an idea where that can help you

200
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,420
improve in the coppersmith methods in

201
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:45,300
other contexts sorry sorry you mean as a

202
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,150
first problem is a polynomial equation

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,890
well what are these helpful polynomials

204
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,410
that you are adding into the lattice I

205
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:58,040
mean you have more polynomials than okay

206
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:02,010
this is a very technical detail so I I

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:07,439
didn't write the detail in the slides

208
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:12,030
you can generate the paper from from the

209
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,600
crypto 29 other he preached he printed

210
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:17,880
if you can earn some some problem or

211
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,410
trouble you can write in me and other

212
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:25,560
authors is very technical detail so it's

213
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:28,890
very long so I need I just the high high

214
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,160
level high level how do you hem for

215
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:35,400
polymer is very important okay so you

216
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,040
the second area popular was this can it

217
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,260
can the technique that you're using be

218
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,319
applied to coppersmith technique more

219
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,819
generally another attacks sorry

220
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,890
again this technique be used more

221
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:56,260
generally in other coppersmith style

222
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:56,260
attacks other coppersmith attacks other

223
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:07,970
for example yeah the the attack on RSA

224
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,310
for example using coppersmith technique

225
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:15,199
yeah can that be improved using your

226
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:18,619
ideas so you mean I could you use this

227
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,100
idea to improve the other bump a lot of

228
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:26,750
anger but I think her this this problem

229
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:32,360
this method could be used the unique

230
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:37,000
creature cub in equation 3 my ignition

231
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:41,919
to the good so I did endure how to say

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,920
maybe I neither program she here

233
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:49,140
to quench hidden Lampe the lamas so the

234
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:54,690
other virus of the hidden Lama problem

235
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:57,750
may be useless the method yes

236
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:01,440
in the example you showed you had nine

237
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:06,090
original polynomials and then you added

238
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,080
three helpful polynomials and number ten

239
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,280
eleven twelve

240
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,679
yes could you add more the more you add

241
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,920
the better your attack will become so

242
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,740
why did you stop it three helper

243
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,980
polynomials is it all you can find all

244
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,620
the all that exists in in the example

245
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,400
yeah yeah this this went probably very

246
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:33,719
important them so indeed proof the

247
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,030
linear independent so you can catch the

248
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,860
more and more high before polymer but

249
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:43,860
this the people polynomial is a linear

250
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:46,679
dependent then the previous is no use

251
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,449
so what is the general bound so many

252
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,100
bicycle and pedestrian

253
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,530
the three polynomial either just the

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:19:01,350
linear individual so we indeed approve

255
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:03,810
at the most but most the lumber 3 is a

256
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,540
linear independent but do you have a

257
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:10,379
general formula for how many linearly

258
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,360
independent helpful polynomials you can

259
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,570
find how many exist

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,350
[Music]

261
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:22,560
yeah so I I cubed this one

262
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,290
so he's uncouth t plus 1 and 2 still

263
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,909
plus 1 is a linear independent okay this

264
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:32,850
always exist yeah yeah yeah I think most

265
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:36,690
yeah this one I can show you so this

266
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:40,139
this is this is basically the linear

267
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:44,640
independent ok because we can prove

268
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,950
improve is a triangle triangle that is

269
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,880
basis matrix so is a media independent

270
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,880
okay thank you

271
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,060
we have time for another question or two

272
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,379
okay let's thank the speaker again thank

273
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,899
you

274
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,899
[Applause]
