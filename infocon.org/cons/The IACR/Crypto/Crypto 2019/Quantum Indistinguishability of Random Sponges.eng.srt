1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,600
thanks a lot for the introduction um

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:16,869
yeah just dive right into it they go so

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,590
quantum adversaries can break RSA and

4
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:23,140
indeed an anniversary that has given axe

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,110
that has access to a large-scale quantum

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,330
computer I can use the Shor's algorithm

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:34,420
to break a couple of most widely used

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,710
public key cryptosystems and the

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,200
question that this fact pose poses might

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:45,610
be other quantum attacks breaking

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,030
symmetric cryptosystems and here the

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,610
answer is yes and this is indeed the

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,930
superposition attack by Kaplan and

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,210
others and Centauri and Schaffner and

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:03,100
those attacks work in in the so called

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:06,190
q2 model so this means that we give the

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,300
adversary quantum access to the and to

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:13,899
the function may be also keyed function

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:18,039
so this gives more power than the usual

20
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:22,080
post quantum model and this will be the

21
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:24,929
the model that we are in this talk and

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,970
we present a scheme that is secure

23
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:31,000
against those superposition attacks so

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,920
in the stronger model and so first I

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,670
want to do I will talk about the attack

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,479
and somehow give you the the gist of it

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:43,890
and so it attacks among other things the

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:49,690
CBC construction so here it is we have

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:54,489
the CBC takes the internal faction

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:56,410
function FK and how you evaluate that

31
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,429
you take the message divide it into

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:03,729
orbit blocks and an excerpt to the

33
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:09,130
internal state and apply F repeat until

34
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:12,310
the whole message is analyzed and the

35
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:16,629
security notion that we aim I'm here at

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,880
as the PRF security so we want for a

37
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,410
random key

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,540
a very construction to be

39
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,359
indistinguishable computationally

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,280
indistinguishable from a random function

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,640
mmm in the model where we give the

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,610
adversary again a superposition access

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,839
to the whole thing so as you have seen

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,420
on the previous talks the adversary can

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,920
prepare a superposition of messages and

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,260
the second register she gets the outputs

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,839
of the function and there is an attack

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,070
running in the inner time in the number

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,410
of bits of the internal state that

50
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,079
breaks the breaks the construction

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:03,870
namely the adversary can find a

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,760
collision that gives the kind of allows

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,360
you to easily distinguish from from an

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,760
imposter okay so this is how the attack

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,000
works and this is the our result so mmm

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,310
if FK is a pseudorandom function secure

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,020
and by q2 model then the sparse

58
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,270
construction similar to the one you've

59
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,330
seen before but I will give more details

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:32,550
on it later so this is the superposition

61
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,280
the deficit a can can can prepare

62
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,750
against the the function okay then the

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,760
resulting construction is secure in

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,910
there and the Q tomorrow as well and

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,519
this is kind of the interaction with the

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:54,090
whole construction okay so this is a

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:57,810
short version of the result um right so

68
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,160
the following we'll discuss details of

69
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,970
the statement first I will give you more

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,799
give you the definition of the

71
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,950
construction and you will see how

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,440
similar it is to the CBC construction

73
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,239
and in the end we'll discuss and for why

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,480
the attack does not work in this case

75
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,260
mmm then I will restate the theorem

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,390
giving you more details and then give

77
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,909
you a sketch of the proof that works

78
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,700
following the modular structure of the

79
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,110
probe by andreyeva and others mmm and

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,060
some of the the key

81
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,310
the statement that we need to make is

82
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,490
the quantum indistinguishability of

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,110
random sponges so we take the sponge

84
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,539
construction instantiate it with a

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,759
random function and we want to show that

86
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,199
this is indistinguishable from a random

87
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,689
function and this is the hard part and

88
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,120
that is solved by the by kind of the

89
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,879
main lemma of our paper that takes more

90
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,400
than half of it basically and there we

91
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,099
use the quantum so-called polynomial

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,068
method by handing and then I will

93
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:05,310
conclude with some opposing some open

94
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:10,680
questions so the sponge construction mm

95
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:12,810
differs from CBC by the internal state

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,550
so now it consists of two parts

97
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:21,779
one of our best and then second part

98
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:26,039
consists of C bits and when we feed the

99
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:29,129
input into the the construction we exert

100
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,128
the Arbit blocks only to the first are

101
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:36,599
bits of the state and the second part is

102
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:38,849
left untouched well until we evaluate

103
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:43,080
the internal function on the whole state

104
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:45,900
and then we feed all the rest of the

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,550
blocks and this is called the absorbing

106
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,599
phase so I'm going to take a sponge and

107
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,180
absorb water and then to get this water

108
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:56,339
out we squeeze it and this is what

109
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,759
happens in the squeezing phase we output

110
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,830
the first are bits of the state and it

111
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,479
is in this construction we can actually

112
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:10,680
ask for longer outputs so we can output

113
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:15,568
more and more blocks of the well of the

114
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,400
output set by applying fi again Megan so

115
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,650
the most prominent use of this

116
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,900
construction is in catch XO the

117
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,698
standardized hash function which are

118
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,549
three and others and some of the use

119
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,629
that is closest to our approach or like

120
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:39,610
our result is the Karaka function used

121
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:43,630
in the house basic scheme things plus

122
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm pointing this out because raka uses

123
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:53,240
this construction with five being the

124
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:55,039
heat function um so somehow I will

125
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,110
explain this a key in business here but

126
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,539
more so this is the same theorem may be

127
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,520
seen before with more details so now I

128
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,318
added the deal so f is a fixed input

129
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,990
length a pseudo-random function or

130
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,550
pseudo-random permutation securing the

131
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,479
queue to model or I give this

132
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,560
superposition access to this guy and

133
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,389
advantage of this it's epsilon and then

134
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,050
the resulting keyed internal functions

135
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:23,030
punch this guy is a variable input

136
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,060
length so the random function securing

137
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,330
the same model with advantage so absent

138
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:34,400
class Q to the fourth power over to to C

139
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:37,130
and C we call the capacity necessarily

140
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,650
important later and right coming back to

141
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,639
how we key the sponge so those of you

142
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:46,008
that know the construction and know how

143
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,039
how we key it this is a very specific

144
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,960
way to do it because sometimes the

145
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,300
internal state is key so basically

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,489
instead of starting with all 0 string we

147
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,759
and put the key in there so we start

148
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,190
from different place or we even put

149
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,500
prepend the message with the key but

150
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,500
here we just key the internal functions

151
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,810
ok so how do we prove this statement

152
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,509
this is pretty straightforward so we

153
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,409
start with the point with a kid function

154
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,820
we want to show that it is close to so

155
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:22,280
computationally indistinguishable from

156
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,650
point with the random internal function

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,039
so this follows from the definition of

158
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:33,679
ok and then we want to go to the random

159
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:38,899
function kind of right with the same

160
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:41,059
input output format as sponge and this

161
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,429
is done by indistinguishability so

162
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,989
basically this is what we call quantum

163
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,370
anesthesia and this is the hard part

164
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,949
right because this follows from the

165
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,690
definition so quantum annealing

166
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,679
indistinguishability of a construction

167
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,899
sponge is

168
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,679
when no other sorry can distinguish a

169
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:03,459
construction from a random Oracle and

170
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:08,049
those five five here and G are uniformly

171
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:10,748
at random now it's important to know

172
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:12,879
that we give the adversary access only

173
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:15,279
to the whole construction and not the

174
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,279
internal function because this would

175
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,230
bring this would put us in the realm of

176
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,829
differentiability that we discussed

177
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,230
before but it's not we not what we do

178
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:30,029
when we can go on me we can use only

179
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:35,079
this notion to prove the statement that

180
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:36,670
sponsored a PRF so right classically for

181
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,128
example the end andreyeva and others

182
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,809
paper this they use the in

183
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:44,079
differentiability bound but it's not

184
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:46,809
necessary okay so as I said this is the

185
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:51,368
main kind of technical statement that we

186
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:56,040
need so to prove this we're going to

187
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:58,889
focus on the sponge construction with

188
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,839
fixed capacity so this is this guy

189
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:05,290
versus with capacity going to infinity

190
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,569
and so this is part of the construction

191
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:13,238
so some of this part will be added some

192
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:18,579
fixed value say thousand 24 bits or are

193
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:22,149
going to infinity so huge so why we do

194
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,679
that we know that because if C goes to

195
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,209
infinity we can show that this is

196
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,660
actually a random function

197
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,998
so basically mmm if this is infinity I

198
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,589
mean very very large going to infinity

199
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:39,040
then every input to Phi is different so

200
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:41,980
and Phi is a random function and when

201
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,759
evaluated on fresh inputs it will always

202
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,040
output a uniformly random output mmm so

203
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,529
this also and this also be the case in

204
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,519
the squeezing face so all outputs will

205
00:10:50,529 --> 00:11:00,029
be just random strings so this works and

206
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,029
so now we focus on the fixed C and

207
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:09,190
important observation that we make is to

208
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,900
say that the probability of others are

209
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,430
interacting with the construction is a

210
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:19,240
linear combination of like this of

211
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:25,270
probabilities that sponge of X I equals

212
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:29,770
y i4 2q pairs X I Y I and so forth right

213
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:33,939
this goes over every possible inputs and

214
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:38,319
outputs and and this statement is

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:47,680
someone somewhat standard and the well

216
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:51,210
quantum well quantum cryptography but we

217
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,359
will use this so this is the same

218
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,240
statement

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,990
mmm in the following way so we're gonna

220
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,730
focus on this part and say that this is

221
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:05,530
a polynomial of a small of small degree

222
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,990
and 1 over 2 to capacity and when we do

223
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,380
that and that's because if this is the

224
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,180
case so this part this probability of 2

225
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,370
Q and put out two pairs is a polynomial

226
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,430
of small degree then the whole thing is

227
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:22,180
also a polynomial of small degree and

228
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:27,910
this gives us the indistinguishability

229
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:30,040
statement that we end it and this part

230
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:34,030
is the hard part because we need to

231
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,880
analyze as probabilities and you have

232
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,650
already seen the picture but mmm yeah

233
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,520
the construction is not straightforward

234
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:48,459
so to find this this polynomial was was

235
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:51,250
the hard part and ok maybe one more so

236
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,260
kind of if we have those polynomials

237
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,680
then going to the indistinguishability

238
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,980
is it's kind of it's completely outside

239
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,530
of the scope of cryptography or it's

240
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,100
just a statement about polynomials then

241
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:10,329
we say that two polynomials differ and

242
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,880
some odd yeah ok

243
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,130
so again this is the main llama finding

244
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,470
this polynomial and but and also finding

245
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,700
the parameter in which it is a

246
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:26,650
polynomial and we show that this is 1

247
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:29,560
over 2 to C and the proof right goes by

248
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,800
just case distinction and counting

249
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,500
number of possibilities by that I mean

250
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,089
number of possible values inside the

251
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,070
construction of kind of values of the

252
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:44,620
internal states in those two Q

253
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,120
evaluations and basically there is

254
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,300
nothing quantum going on here

255
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,720
it just end depth very detailed analysis

256
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:55,209
of the probability expression and so

257
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,820
this is basically it so what we have

258
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,400
done we've proven quantum and

259
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,050
distinguishability of random sponges so

260
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:08,530
this is a technical part and you can use

261
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:10,740
it to write to know that sponge heat

262
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:14,439
biking the internal function is a

263
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:19,000
quantum secure pseudorandom function in

264
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:23,230
this very strong model now we did by

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,010
direct equation probability I didn't say

266
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:30,220
it before but we also managed to prove

267
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:34,780
the whole statement for f being as

268
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:37,390
random permutation or I being a random

269
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:41,640
permutation directly so not going

270
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:44,970
through the PRF JP switching lemma but

271
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,170
looking at the polynomials and kind of

272
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:51,660
generalizing a bit about so this might

273
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:55,630
be of independent interest right and

274
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,370
kind of now we wanted to also think of

275
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:01,330
why the supervision attack doesn't work

276
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,000
and well the intuition is that well

277
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,640
because of this hidden state so this

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,580
part is the adversary has no access to

279
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:15,100
this part and in the CBC I mean in the

280
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:20,160
attack against the CBC construction

281
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:23,089
she prepares a large superposition that

282
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,120
support that are supposed to interfere

283
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,309
in the end to write to make that a quirk

284
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,550
and this this interference does not

285
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:35,449
happen if there's part that she does not

286
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,670
control but yeah so this kind of maybe a

287
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:42,639
technical explanation and we're looking

288
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:45,740
for something more general like yeah

289
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,339
more useful for for other possible

290
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:53,089
attacks mmm right and the second thing

291
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:56,149
is that we we think that our result is

292
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,790
tight we don't have the algorithm but

293
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:02,559
and of this Q to the third power

294
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:09,259
suggests that just a collision attack

295
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:11,629
would suffice and right so the main open

296
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:15,319
question is well word heart on the the

297
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:17,480
proof where can we use it maybe some

298
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:20,139
other construction but they kind of to

299
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,339
see this this polynomial we need this

300
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:25,009
this this part of the state that is

301
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,860
hidden from the user but maybe there are

302
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,269
other interesting cases we would like to

303
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,999
understand better why this purposes

304
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:35,379
attack does not work as I said we have a

305
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:39,740
technical understanding but not so much

306
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:41,420
high level and then right what about in

307
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,199
the finish ability so kind of the notion

308
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,759
more general and also useful when we

309
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:53,809
talk about hash functions and not heat

310
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:56,019
objects and right so we actually have

311
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,129
managed to to do this together with

312
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,889
Kristen - Kristen Schaffner and

313
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,990
Sebastian zoo and we use the technique

314
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:07,849
presented to plantations ago and

315
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:10,839
actually also the the one way to hiding

316
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,829
lemma my my honest homework and

317
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,359
represented on the previous presentation

318
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,359
so thank you very much

319
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:34,110
we have a few minutes for questions in

320
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,620
classical crypt analysis we sometimes

321
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,658
consider related key attacks in which

322
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,000
you are allowed to modify the key in a

323
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:47,159
particular way and see what is the

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,320
effect did anyone look in the quantum

325
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:53,280
world it what happened when you are

326
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:56,908
allowed to modify a fixed classical key

327
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,120
with a superposition of many many

328
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:02,100
possible changes simultaneously so you

329
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,639
are doing a related key attack but in

330
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:09,510
the quantum world mm-hmm

331
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,140
I am NOT and one did it your techniques

332
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,640
for example will apply if you look at

333
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,030
your construction suppose that the key

334
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,520
is only the state of the initial

335
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:26,090
register right and now you are allowed

336
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:28,320
to add to the key any superposition of

337
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:33,299
initial States what will happen to your

338
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,299
proofs also while analyzing this this

339
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,600
probability of those Tokyo input-output

340
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:43,740
pairs and we have to constrain somehow

341
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,500
the kind of which ones we are looking at

342
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,809
so there we fix the initial state to be

343
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,720
zero so we would just need to say that

344
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:54,149
this is also under the control of the

345
00:18:51,720 --> 00:19:03,960
adversary so I guess yeah we can do this

346
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:06,840
we haven't explained initially said that

347
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,700
you cannot like prepare the key that

348
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,649
your analysis is for the kind of

349
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,659
dedicated key mode that the functions

350
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,309
internal function is keyed advising

351
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,559
differentiability result does it mean

352
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,360
that you can do essentially what a

353
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,889
sponge initially suggested to building a

354
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,840
PRF that you can just prepare and key

355
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,179
and that the secure does it follow from

356
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,120
in differentiability maybe this sub

357
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,850
tight bond

358
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:33,049
[Music]

359
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:36,230
I would think so and so mmm I will go

360
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,750
through in the indistinguishability okay

361
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:43,630
because we we need to do this step kind

362
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:46,429
of get rid of the kids stuff and then to

363
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,389
then do the random kind of in the same

364
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:54,559
shitty part and this hammer give that

365
00:19:50,389 --> 00:20:00,769
the we escape from the fact that like we

366
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:03,889
don't want you don't want that very to

367
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,840
have access to the internal function and

368
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,629
in the case you're talking about this

369
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,039
would be natural right but you think it

370
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,899
also your technique doesn't directly

371
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,639
apply but indirectly through in

372
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:15,949
differentiability it would be secured in

373
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:17,389
the yeah I would say so but this is

374
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:25,429
completely different proof technique

375
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:29,689
yeah one question about the owed to

376
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:31,669
model so you're giving superposition

377
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,320
access to this primitive and then

378
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:36,429
getting the superposition answer back

379
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,950
is there a like a real world or

380
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,240
compositional motivation for this in

381
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,990
this model it's a kind of a general

382
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,980
question right so one motivation that

383
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:52,700
I've heard about is kind of hard worry

384
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,179
where you imagine the hardware with this

385
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,240
Keats

386
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:57,860
function you know that you can that

387
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,049
someone has it and some of us may be

388
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,789
some kind of obfuscation well the key is

389
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,870
in there but not really accessible and

390
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:10,220
you can pull it down and make it quantum

391
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:18,350
but and the more the most real world is

392
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:21,519
the post quantum model right we may be

393
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,519
one or two more minutes for questions

394
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:29,230
right let's thank you on again

395
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,230
[Applause]
