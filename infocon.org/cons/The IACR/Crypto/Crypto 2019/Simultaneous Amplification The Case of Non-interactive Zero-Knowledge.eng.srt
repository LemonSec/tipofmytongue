1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,299
so I'm going to talk about simultaneous

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,010
amplification the case of non detective

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,800
zero knowledge and this is joint work

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,139
with the Whipple's animate so in this

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,970
work as you can guess from the title we

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,160
just consider a very basic question and

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,689
the question is that suppose I give you

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,300
a non interactive zero knowledge scheme

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,340
which is not fully secure by which I

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,410
mean that it doesn't have full soundness

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,810
and full zero-knowledge property can we

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,760
construct an Idzik argument system which

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,799
is which satisfies full security so let

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,000
me define the problem formally and show

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:44,129
you how we do it so let's recall what

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,930
non interactive Z knowledge is in non

17
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,030
interactive zero knowledge argument

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,280
system there is a trusted party which

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,280
outputs a common reference or a random

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,659
string as you will and then any prover

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,100
can take an instance and a witness for

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,960
that instance along with the random

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,159
string and output a proof to convince a

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,710
verifier of this fact and it has two

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,090
security notions associated with it the

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,000
first security notion is the soundness

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,710
notion which is associated with the

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
following experiment or the experiment

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,619
is that the trusted party gives out a

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,360
CRS randomly and then there's a

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,100
malicious proverb which is think of it

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
as a polynomial time malicious poober

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,399
who wants to convince the verifier of an

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,980
incorrect state in a statement which is

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,770
not true with a proof that verify is

36
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,280
corresponding to that CRS and we say

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,479
that an exact argument system is Delta's

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,240
sound if if the maximum probability with

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,330
which this malicious poober can convince

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,750
the verifier of such a false proof is

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,158
bounded by at delta s and i will refer

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,470
to this Delta s throughout the talk

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,280
Delta s is I will refer to as the

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,140
soundness error likewise there is also

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
the zero knowledge property in which

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,979
there is a simulator I will denote it

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,069
with mysterio and what it does it it

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,980
takes an instance X and it can fake CRS

49
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,869
and a proof and gives it out to the

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,619
verifier and then verify I can verify

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,680
this fixed CR

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,409
the proof and the $0 properties sales

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,129
awfully this for any polynomial time

54
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:30,099
verifier many cheating verify it holds

55
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:33,280
that the probability with which it can

56
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:37,060
distinguish between a fake proof and the

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,269
crs generated by the simulator with an

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,610
honest proof and the proof this is

59
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,180
bounded by probability delta z and i

60
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:51,280
will refer to this delta z as the zero

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,819
knowledge error okay so now let me try

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
and discuss the relation between these

63
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,319
two parameters so if you look at

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,470
standard nesic arguments we have this

65
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,510
property satisfied so take your favorite

66
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,629
knizac argument that you know from lwe

67
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,120
or by linear maps or even capital

68
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,429
permutations it was that delta s plus

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,940
delta z is negligible because they are

70
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,930
fully secured on the other extreme

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,060
there's a setting which you can

72
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,200
construct clearly and that setting is

73
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,819
when Delta S Plus Delta Z is equal to 1

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,589
and this is because I can give you two

75
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:29,319
particular examples let's just take

76
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,940
Delta s 0 and Delta Z 1 this you can

77
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,649
easily construct by having the prover

78
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,310
always output with witness in the clear

79
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,290
so there because it's outputting witness

80
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,359
in the clear there is no soundness loss

81
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,418
and you can't expect your knowledge

82
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,040
because the witness is revealed and

83
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,650
there's a complimentary condition when

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,019
Delta s is 1 and Delta Z is 0 in this

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,599
case also it's very easy to construct an

86
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,569
is ik argument by just having the prover

87
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,560
output 0 and having the verifier always

88
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:02,260
accept and 0 as the valid proof all

89
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,500
right so what we do in this word we show

90
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,798
that lets take us setting which is very

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,440
slightly non-trivial we just have Delta

92
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,169
s plus Delta Z a little bit less than 1

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,560
let's say it's 1 minus epsilon for an

94
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:19,120
arbitrary small constant epsilon and

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,668
then if you are willing to assume public

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,250
key encryption and Switzer exponential

97
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,320
security what we can show is that such

98
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:30,460
an is ik is enough to imply a fully

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,530
secure in Nasik and along the way we

100
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,080
also

101
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,568
introduced a new object which we call as

102
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:44,289
secret sharing for instances and I will

103
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:47,379
talk about it later in the talk so let's

104
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:49,870
just so first I will describe how the

105
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:52,599
overall approach of this work so what we

106
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,150
do is we redefine two transformations

107
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,789
and somehow use those transformations

108
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,830
one after another

109
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,780
to start off with a week music to a

110
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,520
fully secure Nasik so the first

111
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,409
transformation is a sound s amplifying

112
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,008
transformation and the goal of this

113
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:11,949
transformation is to in to to improve

114
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,669
the soundness of the of the newzik so it

115
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,219
takes a Delta s Delta Z nesic with sub

116
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,859
and assumes of exponential PK and it

117
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,409
increase it improves the soundness from

118
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,110
Delta s to Delta s to the n whereas n n

119
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:29,830
is any polynomial parameter of your

120
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,469
choice so it improves the soundness

121
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,030
however what we show is that it doesn't

122
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:36,240
kill the zero knowledge property

123
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,068
completely we show that it goes from

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,669
Delta Z to this parameter that I have

125
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,050
written 1 minus 1 minus Delta Z to the N

126
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,900
don't worry about this at the moment but

127
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,340
this is what it does

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,169
the second transformation is the zero

129
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,388
knowledge amplifying transformation it's

130
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,940
job is to improve the Z knowledge

131
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,440
property and we show that analogous to

132
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,690
the sound and simplifying transformation

133
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,870
it improves the Z knowledge from Delta Z

134
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,699
- 2 times Delta Z to the N so it

135
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,099
exponentially improves the sound of the

136
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,810
knowledge and we also show that it

137
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,628
doesn't kill the soundness completely so

138
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:15,550
it goes from Delta s to this number 1

139
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:18,039
minus 1 minus Delta s to the n ok so now

140
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:23,580
let's see why these two transformations

141
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:27,690
are enough and so the the reason is it

142
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,979
obvious right yeah so the reason is that

143
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,810
you can use these two revolution one

144
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,960
after another to construct something

145
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,250
secure so let me not bore you with the

146
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
general theorem let me just give you a

147
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,649
concrete example so let's say you have

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,199
Delta XS 0.3 and Delta Z is point 6 so

149
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:45,070
that soundness error plus you knowledge

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,160
error is actually

151
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,800
quite large its 0.9 so in this setting

152
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,790
what you can do is first apply the sound

153
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,140
amplification with this parameter log

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,610
lambda and what you get is something

155
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,800
like this don't worry about the

156
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,110
calculations these parameters are

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,960
correct but you get something and then

158
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,520
you you use this now they can apply the

159
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,099
zero knowledge amplification with this

160
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,049
parameter and what you get is something

161
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:17,410
constant and negligible finally you can

162
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:21,610
just also do the founder's amplification

163
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,750
again to get something fully secure so

164
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,310
this is why these two transformations

165
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,170
are enough for our purpose

166
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,340
all right let's let's now look at these

167
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,510
two transformations the first

168
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,419
transformation is the sound s

169
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,280
amplification and as you already know

170
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,960
how do you increase soundness you just

171
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,520
repeat and get repeated in parallel and

172
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,760
this has been studied in many many words

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,349
[Music]

174
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,070
historically so what we do is that we

175
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:51,250
have we just have some parameter N and

176
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,219
have the CRS a generation B just

177
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,670
sampling n independent copies of the CRS

178
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,800
using your underlying music and then if

179
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,720
you want to prove a statement X then

180
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,700
what you do is using each copy of the

181
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,950
CRS you generate an independent copy of

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,789
the proof for the same same statements X

183
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,250
and that's it that's your proof so we

184
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:16,690
know this time again that this improves

185
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:18,010
soundness so this is the latest version

186
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,980
of the soundness amplification which

187
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,830
directly applies to file repetition and

188
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,560
this was due to kinetically bian Steiner

189
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,710
hoop and we also reprove in this in our

190
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,240
paper what they showed is that suppose

191
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,390
you have one is like argument system

192
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,310
which is say Delta s sound and the

193
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,949
soundness holds against some adversaries

194
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,799
of size s then when you repeat it in

195
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,140
parallel with the n repetitions then

196
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,109
what you get at the end is something

197
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,500
like Delta s to the n plus a small

198
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,390
edited additive factor and Epsilon and

199
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,060
it holds again the adversaries of

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,860
slightly smaller size which is Hotel de

201
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,750
office Epsilon and I'm hiding some

202
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,930
factors in AU tilde but they are not

203
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:06,370
important so let me repeat again what it

204
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,378
does is it takes deltas sound argument

205
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,980
which holds against adversity of sizes

206
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:14,079
what we get is what ideally we would

207
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,910
expect is Delta s to the N what we don't

208
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,899
quite get that we get Delta s to the n

209
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,000
plus some additive factor and epsilon

210
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,420
which also factors in the reduction of

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
the size for which against the class of

212
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,810
adversaries which the resulting system

213
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,279
holds soundness against and further in

214
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,569
this work we show that if you are

215
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,759
willing to assume public key encryption

216
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:43,540
then even the adaptive soundness is

217
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:46,209
conserved so this was soundness

218
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,519
amplification and this we already know

219
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,109
how to deal with it let's now focus on

220
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,470
the zero knowledge amplification part

221
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,449
this is new to our work so in zero

222
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,639
knowledge one first the first idea that

223
00:09:55,449 --> 00:10:00,099
comes to mind and which I would show is

224
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,800
wrong is the following suppose you want

225
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,449
to increase increase zero knowledge

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,079
poverty what you would think is let's

227
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:10,870
just compose one proof with another so

228
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:14,469
left let's have the crs be two

229
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,259
independent sample CRS of the underlying

230
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:21,939
music and let's prove X's and L using

231
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:24,399
Diner this X using the CRS one and then

232
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:26,889
you can use your astute would prove that

233
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,079
this proof that you generated is valid

234
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:33,579
and you will output by two so that's

235
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:35,109
that's the idea however you would you

236
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,638
would expect that this shouldn't

237
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,279
increase as you knowledge because

238
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,079
suppose in every one is Delta Z secured

239
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,459
then on composition you would think that

240
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,680
you should get something like Delta Z

241
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,469
square but what we show is that this

242
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,628
intuition is completely flawed in fact

243
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,110
there is a very simple counter example

244
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:55,689
to this fact and this counter example is

245
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,740
the following so suppose you want to

246
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:02,800
build a music counter example let's

247
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,360
start with the secure music and then we

248
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,839
build the counter example as follows

249
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,519
so the crs generation for this counter

250
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,459
example is just the crs for the

251
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,179
underlying security sake

252
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:17,279
and then in order to prove a statement

253
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,899
if your statement has some specific

254
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,269
structure let's say it has bought

255
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,980
appended with some string in that case

256
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:27,480
you just output the witness in the clear

257
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:30,029
along with this statement otherwise you

258
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,269
just sample a bit be if beat shows up

259
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:37,379
one then you output the proof

260
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:40,220
honestly generating the using the using

261
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:42,649
the underlying music argument honestly

262
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,990
otherwise if B is equal to zero you just

263
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,929
format the string with but and output a

264
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,339
little longer the witness so you don't

265
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:52,139
have to worry about too much about the

266
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,920
detail but the point I'm trying to make

267
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,059
is if you use such an argument then

268
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,089
there is no hope to increase soundness

269
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,290
beyond 1/2 and there is no hope to

270
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:03,449
increase your knowledge beyond 1/2

271
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:10,259
because with some 1/2 probability it

272
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:11,969
clearly leaks the witness so we need to

273
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,749
develop new technology in order to

274
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,369
handle this issue and what we do is we

275
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:19,439
we define something called as verifiable

276
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,049
sharing for instances and here the goal

277
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:24,809
is that suppose you have an instant be

278
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:27,720
instance and a witness you will secret

279
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:32,249
share it in into an instant witnesses

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:34,499
pair so X W is the instance witness and

281
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:37,439
you you will get shares X 1 W 1 through

282
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:40,350
xn w n such that there are two security

283
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:43,829
properties that are satisfied the first

284
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,379
security property is that if X 1 to xn

285
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,349
are adverse like an adverse adversarial

286
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:52,170
sharing of X and they happen to be in

287
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,549
the language then X should also be in

288
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,079
the language so this happen

289
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:59,369
this holds with respect to adversary

290
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:02,128
sharing of of X comma W and the second

291
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:04,769
property is that if X 1 and X n were

292
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,369
honest degenerated shells and I happen

293
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:11,100
to just leak out n minus 1 greatnesses

294
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:16,470
then those witnesses should not leak any

295
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,749
information about the membership of X we

296
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,540
can actually construct it in a not very

297
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:23,929
difficult manner there is this thing

298
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,620
called MPC in the head which was

299
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:28,170
proposed by

300
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,960
elevates Ostrovsky and Sahai and then we

301
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,550
can instantiate it for semi honest MPC

302
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,270
protocol so with perfect correctness

303
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:39,300
this in a very non not sort indirect

304
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,010
manner gives you this notion and you can

305
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,829
use public key encryption to implement

306
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,550
commitments for this so I would refer

307
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,350
you to the paper for construction so now

308
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,510
once you have this sharing the zero

309
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,150
knowledge amplification question is very

310
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,580
simple what you do is just have

311
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,100
independent copies of CR aces as the

312
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,680
part of the CRS have this public key as

313
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,380
the set up at the set up for generating

314
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,479
commitments and then you need a proof

315
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,450
you just secret share your X and witness

316
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,160
to generate shares and then for each X I

317
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,200
you will use the Sierra site we generate

318
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,779
the profile and that's it that's the

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,029
output of the zero-knowledge

320
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:21,800
amplification the compiled version of

321
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,800
the document

322
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,120
so now let's now look at this

323
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,720
transformation in zero-knowledge

324
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,100
amplification case we have we can prove

325
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,540
the following thing about the soundness

326
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,360
we prove that the soundness is not

327
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:41,339
completely killed and we show that

328
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,010
suppose we have a Delta s sound argument

329
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,680
system which happens to be against

330
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:51,120
adversity of sizes then when you use

331
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,819
this transformation then what we can get

332
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,029
is something like 1 minus 1 minus Delta

333
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,940
Z Delta s to the n plus order of epsilon

334
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,770
sound against adversity of slightly

335
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,740
smaller size that is a strength of salon

336
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,380
again the same phenomena happens here we

337
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,240
started with Delta s and we would expect

338
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,070
one minus one minus Delta s to the end

339
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,170
but we don't quite get that we get an

340
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:18,150
additive term which also factors in the

341
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,529
reduction of the size of that messy yeah

342
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,150
so this is the main theorem for

343
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,890
zero-knowledge

344
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,770
amplification and what we show is if we

345
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,689
started with Delta Z zero knowledge

346
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,150
assuming public key encryption which is

347
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,660
sub-exponential secure what we get is 2

348
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:37,439
times Delta Z to the n plus order and

349
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,829
epsilon 0 is property against circuits

350
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,830
of slightly smaller size

351
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,390
and the tooth the tooth term here comes

352
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,010
just because we first argue witness

353
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,569
indistinguishability and then we argue

354
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:53,290
the zero knowledge so there's a factor

355
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:55,780
of two last year all right so let's now

356
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,959
look at the how do you argue soundness

357
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,000
theorems in both both the cases and the

358
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,050
idea was present even before our word

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,720
this is this notion of verifiable weakly

360
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,729
verifiable puzzles and I won't talk

361
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,880
about it in detail you can look at the

362
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,320
our paper or also the Kennedy Halloway

363
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,020
Steiner paper let's now look at how do

364
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,580
you argues your knowledge theorems so

365
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,470
for arguing zero knowledge theorem I

366
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,810
mean actually need to rely on this

367
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,760
machinery called hard corsets and we

368
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,099
rely on this very beautiful theorem by

369
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,930
modern Tarot who proved an

370
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,450
indistinguishable ax T version of this

371
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:38,020
hard cassette theorem and it's on the

372
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,210
next slide so it looks scary but

373
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,470
actually it's what it says is quite

374
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:47,440
simple what it says is that suppose I

375
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,560
have two functions a and F which are

376
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,070
gamma indistinguishable by gamma I mean

377
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,339
this this probability is gamma to any

378
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,700
adversary of sizes whenever x and y are

379
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,380
sampled and every suppose I have yeah

380
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,360
a of X and F of Y are gamma

381
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,220
indistinguishable then what you can do

382
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:11,109
is finds fine sets s0 and s1 which have

383
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,480
high enough density like 1 minus gamma

384
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:16,958
such that when you sample randomness

385
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,360
from s 0 and s 1 then ENF become epsilon

386
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,670
indistinguishable for adversities of

387
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,040
slightly smaller size which is s times

388
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,530
epsilon square

389
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,830
let me repeat myself what this theorem

390
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,060
she says is that if you have two

391
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,250
functions en F which are gamma

392
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,950
indistinguishable against some class of

393
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,590
adversity of sizes where x and y were

394
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,440
randomly chosen then there exists two

395
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:44,230
sets s0 and s1 of density one minus

396
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,440
gamma one at least such that when you

397
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,980
sample from them ena and F now suddenly

398
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,260
become epsilon indistinguishable

399
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,790
where it this is indistinguishability

400
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,490
holes against adversity of slightly

401
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,409
smaller sites so now by choosing this

402
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,420
epsilon appropriately you can said you

403
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,890
can choose this advantage appropriately

404
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,420
so this is a very powerful theorem and

405
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,590
it's used in almost all the

406
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,530
amplification results so here is our

407
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,179
zero knowledge amplification strategy

408
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,760
unfortunately I won't have come full

409
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:22,110
time to talk about like the complete

410
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,940
details but here is the first idea so

411
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,979
the basic idea is consider a mental

412
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,760
experiment where you are sampling a

413
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,230
uniform string so as I told you the

414
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,580
[Music]

415
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,650
fornix since it's delta is easier

416
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,560
knowledge it has a hard cassette or a

417
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,780
good set of density 1 minus Delta so a

418
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,370
uniform string will lie in the hard

419
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,889
cassette with probability 1 minus Delta

420
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:47,699
Z and it will lie in the complement

421
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:50,390
otherwise and so we can actually use

422
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,700
this property to construct a hybrid like

423
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:56,900
like this so what you do is you sample a

424
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,520
string you sample a string like this

425
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,250
such that one is set with probability 1

426
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,460
minus Delta Z and 0 is sampled with

427
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,430
probability just Delta Z so now when you

428
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,620
get a 1 use some sample you generate CRS

429
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:15,060
1 and the proof 1 from the hardcore set

430
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,560
otherwise if you get a 0 you generate it

431
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,990
from the compliment of the hard cassette

432
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,419
and remember when you are in the

433
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,180
hardcore set you can switch this part to

434
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,850
a simulated proof and your goal would be

435
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,360
to somehow simulate at least one of the

436
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,250
indices so that now you can get rid of

437
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,709
one of the witnesses for one of the

438
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,360
exercise and then it will become it the

439
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,300
hybrid will become independent of the

440
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,189
witness and and then that will allow you

441
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:47,399
allow you to argue security however this

442
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:50,490
is a simplified approach and this as is

443
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,750
cannot work and the reason behind is is

444
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,700
the following the reason is that if you

445
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,800
look at these sets hard courses they are

446
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,360
extremely inefficient to sample from and

447
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,190
they are very calm but they have very

448
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,500
complex descriptions

449
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,450
so if you sample from them you can

450
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,350
actually completely break the security

451
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:13,970
of the secret sharing scheme so it seems

452
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,649
like we are in some trouble but

453
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:20,549
fortunately what we have at our disposal

454
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:24,029
is that the sets have very high density

455
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,519
and so if it's like one minus Delta Z

456
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:29,190
they're dense where Delta Z is like one

457
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:32,580
over poly then it has high density and

458
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:36,330
then and then it doesn't leak too much

459
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,250
information about about the secret

460
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:43,139
sharing scheme so we can formalize this

461
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:45,570
argument using an idea which was which

462
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:49,080
was also there in the in my work with

463
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:53,340
probe ng inanimate on on ended on IO and

464
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,980
we use those ideas here to formalize a

465
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,610
way to efficiently sample from hard core

466
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:04,649
sets and I will refer you to the paper

467
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:08,459
for details and with with this finally

468
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:11,580
let me conclude with some open questions

469
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,590
so first Ken is it possible to get rid

470
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:18,059
of public key encryption to get an

471
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:21,539
unconditional result the second question

472
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,220
is can we construct this amplification

473
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,399
with better parameters so right now we

474
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:30,269
have this the our compiler is not very

475
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:32,580
efficient also there is another annoying

476
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:34,679
thing that is we can only handle when

477
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,220
Delta s plus Delta Z is one minus some

478
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,100
constant

479
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,820
can we go all the way to one minus one

480
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,250
by security parameter and finally

481
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,960
another interesting direction is can we

482
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,470
study simultaneous amplification for

483
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,990
other cryptographic primitives with this

484
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,200
I would like to conclude and please ask

485
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,200
me questions

486
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:07,150
thank you various do we have any

487
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,720
questions okay if not let's think I use

488
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,069
again

489
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,069
[Applause]
