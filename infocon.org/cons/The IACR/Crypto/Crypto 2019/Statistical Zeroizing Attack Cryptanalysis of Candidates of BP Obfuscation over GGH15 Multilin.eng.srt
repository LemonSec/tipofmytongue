1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,020
thank you for introduction I talk about

2
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:13,360
statistical terrorizing attack on office

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,820
occasions over GG G 15 Virginia well

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,750
this is joint work with Johnny Chan

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:23,050
Ronnie Cho Ming jihad and chun-li the

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,570
online of online consists of backgrounds

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:30,009
previous work and our work and further

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,770
works ok I was tucked back on part in

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,590
this team Jala confiscation is

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,469
polynomial time algorithm the transforms

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:42,929
the program P into an obfuscated program

12
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:46,179
P which preserve the functionality and

13
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,519
gives a one bit unintelligible on

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:52,059
Bologna one bit a little unintelligible

15
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:54,699
is to hide on bit information that one

16
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:58,690
of two equivalent programs is overstated

17
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:01,358
here by equivalent amines post programs

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:06,158
have the same functionality and have

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,250
synthesized for such programs their

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,820
office Katie the programs are

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,050
computationally in this together I won't

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,660
be any information it is very powerful

23
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,240
tour since there are many cryptography

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,369
applications based on existence of

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,729
office occasions such as functional

26
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:30,040
encryptions and we need encryptions and

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,290
with fat chicks changing so constructing

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,360
office kitchen is a challenging problem

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:40,210
in cryptography the core of this period

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,789
is to construct office kitchen for NZ

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,089
one circuit since it can be booster for

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:48,280
two I offer all circuits when you have a

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,250
home of inclusion with and cont position

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,950
circuit there are two approaches to

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,820
construct office occasions the first

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,130
approach is called direct construction

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,320
it is basic law cryptography multi neo

38
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,929
maps represent two by real military

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,280
candidates

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,410
GGH 13:13 and GDG 15 also it is

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,280
branching programs and are somatic

42
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:18,480
circus is a input program and it is

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,330
probably secure on the idealized version

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,760
idealized means martini arrives only

45
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,680
provides the handlers of their

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:33,250
operations instead of real competition

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:38,069
however in the real world it has been

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:41,470
suffered from many theorizing attacks

49
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,629
the other approach is construction we

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,450
are bootstrapping it is based on the

51
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:50,200
function encryptions and strengthen

52
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:54,220
generators recently so is furniture is

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,379
secretively by new map and weeks learned

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,489
on generators are used to construct

55
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,420
office Keesha

56
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,940
this will be discussed in desktop so I

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,730
focus on the first approach is correct

58
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,730
which is a direct construction I

59
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,709
introduce brief history of occasions

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:20,319
based on gjt 15 Virginia web now first

61
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:24,910
to candidate curve gthe artist of your

62
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:28,988
papers was proposed in 2013 it is based

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,840
on any martini events so it is natural

64
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:36,870
to consider GGH our story of occasion

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:41,049
plus based on gg gg 15 martini away and

66
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,530
the first con tomate tag was pasted was

67
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,720
proposed in few days few years later by

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,290
serving the prince prince variety of

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,829
problems they showed the digital story

70
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,540
of occasion based on GD 8050 Martino web

71
00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:00,669
is not secured in the same in years

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,150
implementational of us implementation of

73
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:07,629
obfuscation space 2015 was proposed but

74
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,799
it was broken by the next paper called

75
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:14,440
scimitar 18 a paper savita rating

76
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,760
propose a new class code tag which

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:22,000
targets all GGH our story and a DSS

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:26,139
office caches and it also presents a new

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,650
seeker of us kitchen which is robust

80
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,090
against or no no text in the same years

81
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,219
another paper

82
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:40,150
called pjg 18 propose a provably secure

83
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:45,730
location based all the algebraic borders

84
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:48,880
I talked about later so now only two

85
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,250
schemes are standing now Savita really

86
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,219
envisioned office occasions are secured

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,410
against or not text moreover being your

88
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,419
host Keisha is probably secure on the

89
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:03,700
GDG 15 the right model which captures

90
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:07,659
generalized or no algebraic 0 IG

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:12,669
revising attacks on GGG 15 so in this

92
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,370
situation we naturally in this situation

93
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,549
we have a literal two questions are they

94
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:23,290
stick here and it's the model enough to

95
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:26,160
construction our our work is a passer

96
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:28,690
answer with these tools at two questions

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,940
in this world we introduced a new

98
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,940
cryptanalysis called status codes

99
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,820
arising attack on most occasions based

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,669
on gjt 50 martini away we also applied

101
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,000
the status code tab to see Victoria and

102
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:46,690
billions of us occasions as a result our

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,080
tech breaks the civet of reification for

104
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,479
current parameters and we showed the

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,130
algebraic security water is not enough

106
00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:01,060
to achieve ideal locations indeed we

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,340
break indeed we break the BG me office

108
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,729
kitchen for year the parameters whose

109
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,880
secret fruit whose the secretive

110
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:16,539
profiteer horse so our take is not

111
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:19,570
captured by the algebraic bowler to

112
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:23,979
introduce our tank we we briefly divide

113
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:27,610
gjt 50 ma Geneva gjt 15 martini events

114
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:30,340
offers the additions multiplications and

115
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,250
zero test operations our operations are

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:37,049
defined on a graph whose vertices are

117
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,710
random matrix is AI with on a tee from

118
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,710
AI to AJ

119
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,900
the encoding of g50 martini aware has a

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,789
special structures if this encoding of

121
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:55,979
em with on 80 from i to j then AIT is

122
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:58,750
approximately equal to m IJ and

123
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,990
additional and multiplications are the

124
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:06,190
same as various operations and the last

125
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:10,060
operations kill the key operation of GGG

126
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:13,630
fifty martino map is a zero test it is

127
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,800
used to determine whether the battery is

128
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:21,460
zero or not indeed a fatigue double

129
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,630
prime is encoding of and with a with the

130
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:28,210
speciality from zero to H then H of 0 t

131
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:33,490
double prime is approximately to equal

132
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:36,580
to M reso H duty to construction so we

133
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,900
can determine whether n is or not by

134
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:44,080
calculating normal the matrix a 0 d

135
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:49,150
double prime if n is 0 then the

136
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:54,849
batteries sorry the matrix should be

137
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:58,630
small however if M is that zero then the

138
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:05,650
dome is not smart because a H a sub H is

139
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:07,990
the Lindo matrix or we now record the

140
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,270
diffusion of branching programs for

141
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,090
boolean functions a branching program

142
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:18,150
for boolean functions consists of 280

143
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,150
binary matrices and function G

144
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,030
evaluation at an input X is to multiply

145
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,960
this binary matrices in predetermined

146
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,419
order if putting a function outputs 0

147
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,059
then the result matrices also 0

148
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:39,520
otherwise if boolean function up to 1

149
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:42,150
then the leader treacherous is not is

150
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,660
none Jian but is non zero matrix

151
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:49,930
although we entered this branching

152
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,760
program for boolean functions any engine

153
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,109
circuits can be converted into a

154
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,439
branching programs

155
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:02,860
so Frenchy program is used to is used as

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:05,300
an input program of office occasions so

157
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,590
we are ready to describe how to

158
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,859
construct an office occasions first I

159
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,440
hope conscious level 2 algorithms called

160
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,740
office occasions and variations of a

161
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,750
schedule has the three-step first

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,720
convert your program into a branch of

163
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,610
program and the next step is randomized

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,240
branching programs while preserving the

165
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:32,180
functionality the first candidate GGH

166
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,000
RSW used a safeguard and research

167
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,069
candidates see Victoria and beating your

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,160
host occasions use a chronic intensive

169
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,200
product both randomizing techniques are

170
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,420
used to prevent any invalid evaluations

171
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,310
the last step of obfuscation is to

172
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:55,819
encode a randomized matrices using judge

173
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:59,239
1580 15-year evaluation of a prosecution

174
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:03,710
is simple it is it is the same as the

175
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:08,060
zero test of GGG 15 Virginia where as an

176
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:10,400
example we introduced simplify the

177
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,619
between your vacations our target

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,920
program is the set of a batteries and I

179
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:20,720
which always alpha zero so we'll skip a

180
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,180
soft scripted related to input X for a

181
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,090
mattress name why we can calculate the

182
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,660
randomized no mattress as I had using a

183
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:33,380
chronic or tenser product and then using

184
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,500
of GDG 50 martini map we computed we

185
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:42,040
compute D prime i which is encoding of

186
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:48,610
as I had with an edgy from i to i plus 1

187
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:52,130
and then P&G also begin g papers and

188
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,850
extra-long matrix called OPI to prevent

189
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:59,510
or a direct attacks

190
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:03,620
moreover to hide the extra long matrix p

191
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,110
i they cut they multiply to invertible

192
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:10,540
matrices are i inverse and are

193
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:14,990
plus one we call the reserve a trace

194
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:18,410
di then the occasion over a program M is

195
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,910
the set of a which is the concatenation

196
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:26,990
of a zero from GGC fifty martini web and

197
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:32,569
identity matrix and the set of encoding

198
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:35,779
the batteries di as I already said evil

199
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,810
nation is the stay almost the same as

200
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:42,579
zero test of GGG fifteen we just comes

201
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:46,550
to the norm of the matrix a product D is

202
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:54,140
indeed the matrix is the approximately

203
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:58,130
equal to approximately equal to the zero

204
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:02,089
test of GGG 15 and proto extra long

205
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:06,070
batteries we the product of extra long

206
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:09,170
battery is much smaller than Q so

207
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:14,600
evaluation process preserve the

208
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:19,160
functionality now I talked about

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:24,260
previous work first we record the

210
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:28,160
security diffusion of IO when you have

211
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,529
two equivalent programs amen and and one

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,939
of a sketch program of one of them

213
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:37,910
corridor P then secretly / io is the

214
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,630
loan can determine whether P is the N

215
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,640
word and in polynomial time other words

216
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:50,930
in other words other words words we want

217
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:55,730
to determine whether P is M or n doctor

218
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:58,489
the observation of analysis of Education

219
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,670
is simple we consider the simple

220
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,360
branching programs which is alpha 0 M is

221
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:08,120
the set of to 0 matrices and

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,930
instead of one identity matrix and one

223
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,500
zero matrices then two programs post-ups

224
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:20,329
zero and we also consider the simplest

225
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,269
of occasions called o P the simplest

226
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:26,899
means we skipped or and amazing

227
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,329
techniques in of two constructs for

228
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,180
constructing of occasions then we

229
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:37,010
observe a variation of all P it depends

230
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,589
on branching programs and or n moreover

231
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,750
a variation over oh please

232
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:45,380
batteries over integers since all

233
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,380
matrices are small therefore although

234
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:53,750
attacks have been using this algebraic a

235
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:56,600
difference over integers so the recent

236
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,089
paper pigeon g18 show the or nonzero

237
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,570
izing attacks can construct a Nigerian

238
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:06,940
relations between zero test leaders of

239
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,940
zero tests and randomized Dimitri's

240
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,890
between your post occasionally move the

241
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:18,500
algebraic relations by adding the extra

242
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:22,959
flow matrix V I so we get algebraic

243
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,959
framework it may not be used for anymore

244
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:32,839
now I talk about our attacks on the

245
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:35,000
outside of our diving framework we

246
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,360
employ the statistical properties from

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,910
the same observations the evaluation of

248
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:46,130
branch of a sketchy program depends on

249
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:51,140
branching programs M or M so we can

250
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:54,769
define two random variables X sub I and

251
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:59,500
we now consider matrices as random

252
00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:02,390
variables then we can we the two random

253
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,510
variables XM and xn are very defined

254
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:10,250
which corresponds to evaluation of M and

255
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:12,529
evaluation evaluation event like

256
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,990
previous Oh tell your software to

257
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,990
distribution we altered their 2d

258
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:22,730
divisions may be different because of

259
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:26,720
the new Tom the new Tom paper to rate

260
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:31,120
this revisions to show this we need to

261
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,130
compute their expectations and variance

262
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,649
the simplest case of aesthetics

263
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,439
catalyzing attack is when the

264
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:44,089
expectations of two distributions are

265
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:47,180
different coin graph is distributions

266
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:51,589
for random variable exam and ready graph

267
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,989
is distribution for and the variables X

268
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,770
n then we can easily find the social

269
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,250
situation of the T and if in addition of

270
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:03,829
all P is small then he they we know

271
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:09,740
Pecos and with over me probably

272
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:13,730
otherwise pkers however in our cases

273
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,870
most expectations are 0 so we need to

274
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:21,589
consider on other cases if two variables

275
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,350
are Gaussian and their variances are

276
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:29,240
different they we also find the social

277
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:32,180
series of the team and we know when when

278
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,550
evaluation of all P is small larger than

279
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,069
T then P across them with Oberman

280
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,930
probability unfortunately in our this

281
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:45,290
two random variables are that caution

282
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,899
decisions actually if they are out of

283
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,480
air they are too much complex because of

284
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,110
their summations and product of random

285
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,070
variables

286
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:59,270
moreover tearing down barriers have the

287
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:04,520
dependency so actual test because a lot

288
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:05,750
a lot a lot a lot of competitions so we

289
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,089
need to

290
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:14,400
we need to formally analyze it we pour

291
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:17,730
some ingredient from the cryptography

292
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,180
and statistics they are simple variances

293
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,829
and standard library argument and here

294
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,420
is the assumptions or product of D is

295
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:35,189
the huge the assumption is verified

296
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:37,470
using the implementation of HHS s 2 so

297
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,810
our T also start from the same

298
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,740
observation that evaluation over two

299
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:46,919
programs the evaluation of occasion

300
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,810
depends on branching programs the

301
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,440
difference of statistical properties

302
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:54,720
showed the witness IO as a result we

303
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:00,390
break the civet of reification for

304
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:03,750
current parameters and the algebraic

305
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,590
water proposed by VG mg is not enough to

306
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,650
construct an idea of Ischia

307
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,230
the implication of our attack is simple

308
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,040
or statistical properties should be the

309
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,270
same regardless of which programs

310
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,790
therefore when you use a permutation

311
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,230
branch program which is the set of all

312
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,600
permutation matrices

313
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:29,220
it is the counter measure of our tip

314
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,949
borovo if you can change parameters

315
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:38,310
resource those countermeasures now our

316
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,150
talk about further works the first

317
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,520
Photoworks

318
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,040
is how to apply statistical generating

319
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:49,800
or text to other of occasions based on

320
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:52,170
GGG 13 or 13 13 to the best of our

321
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,100
knowledge e is seemed to be impossible

322
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,110
because of their structure is is too

323
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,790
different

324
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,159
the next question is how to construct

325
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,580
our first Keisha which is a pro very

326
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,530
secure against theorizing attacks

327
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,350
moreover which class of attacks should

328
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,230
be considered to construct our first

329
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,050
occasion we need to construct we need to

330
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,180
consider and list the two tiles algebra

331
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,870
the right no texts are deregulating or

332
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,840
text and

333
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,159
status codes original text however we

334
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,709
don't know anyone
