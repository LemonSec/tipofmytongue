1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,899
don't work with senior Park at MIT and

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,850
Harvard the subtitle of this talk is

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,980
repeatability and claim ability of ring

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,629
signatures but it might as well have

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,220
been unrepaired ability and unclaimed

6
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:20,730
bull and claim ability offering two

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:24,240
features so ring signature is defined by

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,130
Rivest Shamir and Taman allow or variant

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,810
of digital signatures that allow signing

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,128
on behalf of some set of parties that

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,420
have the requirements that only a member

12
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:35,190
of the set can have produced the

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,520
signature but they hide which member of

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,459
the set was responsible so parties can

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,940
independently generate secret key public

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,090
key pairs and post their public keys and

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,769
at any point afterwards a party can take

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,750
a set of public keys including

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,410
themselves and sign on behalf of that

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,120
set and the signature provides the

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,589
guarantee is that only some member of

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,989
that set can have produced the signature

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,259
but an outside adversary can't tell

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,158
which member so ring signatures are

25
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:11,520
motivated in part by whistleblowing

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,729
scenarios so suppose a official wants to

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,240
come forward with evidence of

28
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:20,009
misbehavior in an agency they can so

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,899
they may be wary of retribution from

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,029
higher-ups so they may want to use a

31
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,490
ring signature scheme to sign on behalf

32
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:31,109
of some set of party some set of senior

33
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,579
of senior officials where the ident

34
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:36,208
where this set of people sort of

35
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,059
provides some sort of reputation that

36
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:43,139
someone in a position of information has

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,779
provided this message but then suppose

38
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:49,109
that that someone comes to each of these

39
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:51,298
individuals in in the in the in the ring

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,229
and demands proof that they did or

41
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,469
didn't sign the message can can they

42
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:02,189
comply and it's not clear under under

43
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:06,238
the usual definitions so for another

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:11,008
example suppose that someone wants to

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:13,590
use ring signatures to to harm the

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,239
reputation of a celebrity or a

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,820
politician

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,290
so suppose they sign a message on behalf

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,810
of a set of parties

50
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,140
including themselves and including some

51
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,730
celebrity where the where the contents

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,920
of the message are some embarrassing

53
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:35,659
statement so of course this doesn't this

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,319
doesn't actually say anything about the

55
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,429
celebrity having said anything

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,290
embarrassing because anyone in the ring

57
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,290
could have produced the signature but it

58
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,120
may sort of it may they may post this on

59
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,000
the internet it may go viral and it

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,430
might be it might harm the reputation of

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,170
of the prominent figure so is there

62
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,299
anything that Alice can do to to recover

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,708
her reputation and prove that she was

64
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,220
not responsible for producing this

65
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,200
signature so to do this let's take

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,659
another look at the anonymity

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,040
definitions for ring signatures so we

68
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,510
have the unforgeable ax t definition and

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,099
also the anonymity definition that an

70
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,629
adversary can't tell which party in the

71
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,608
ring produced the signature so we we

72
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,888
want to be more specific about the power

73
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:23,129
of this adversary and what information

74
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,569
that they have so there's a whole

75
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,280
landscape of definitions for ring

76
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,410
signatures I'm going to talk now about

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,629
two of the of the strongest ones

78
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,400
anonymity against adversarial a chosen

79
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:37,290
keys on anonymity against full key

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,889
exposure so in in the adversary chosen

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,709
keys setting you have you have a bunch

82
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,019
of you have some honest parties that

83
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,639
produce the produced keys and you have

84
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,040
the adversary that can corrupt as many

85
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,099
parties as they want and can also

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,078
generate malformed keys and at the end

87
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,388
the requirement that you have is that

88
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,459
the adverse that as long as there are

89
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,440
some two parties that were not corrupted

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,480
by the adversary the adversary cannot

91
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,659
distinguish which of these parties was

92
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,190
responsible for the message even

93
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,260
stronger definition is provided by

94
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,000
anonymity against full key exposure in

95
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,790
which the adversary can corrupt all of

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,940
the parties but as long as some pair of

97
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,108
keys were sampled honestly even even

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,750
knowing all of the secret keys the

99
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,349
adversary still can't tell which party

100
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:30,719
which party signed the message these

101
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:31,889
definitions don't don't tell us the

102
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:35,810
whole picture

103
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,669
of whether a signatory who wishes to

104
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,969
later approve or deny authorship of a

105
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:47,128
signature should be able to do so and

106
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:49,498
both both versions are are very are

107
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,740
natural to consider and what we'd like

108
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:55,080
is a guarantee one way or the other of

109
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,469
whether this was possible or not so in

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,349
our work we introduced four definitions

111
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:04,289
that let's specify whether this is

112
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:08,250
possible so a reputable ring signature

113
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,680
scheme is one in which a non signer can

114
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,180
prove that they were not responsible for

115
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,349
producing the signature that some other

116
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,949
party and the ring produced the

117
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:21,750
signature unconverted an unrepeatable

118
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:23,819
scheme this is not possible even if I

119
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,129
did not sign the message I am NOT able

120
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,129
to convince someone else of this fact

121
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,069
and we can also look at whether I can

122
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,990
prove that I was responsible so so a

123
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,419
claimable scheme is one in which if I if

124
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,449
I produced a signature I can later come

125
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,719
forward and demonstrate that I was

126
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:49,319
responsible for that that the signature

127
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:52,649
was produced using my key if I choose to

128
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,139
or I can never do this and we can also

129
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,229
define an unclaimed bull scheme in which

130
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,389
no matter what I do later if I as long

131
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,529
as I assign this use of rings an

132
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,719
unclaimed bull scheme to sign this

133
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,399
message even if I later want to come

134
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:08,069
forward and prove that I was responsible

135
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:12,240
for signing the message there's nothing

136
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:13,620
convincing I can say that that will that

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,620
will assure you that I was responsible

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,469
for signing the message now when you

139
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,159
look at the idea of an unclaimed bull

140
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:26,969
ring signature scheme it seems like this

141
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:28,699
shouldn't be achievable it may seem like

142
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:31,289
this shouldn't be achievable because

143
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,699
suppose that you sign the you sign a

144
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,068
message and you remember the signing

145
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,409
randomness then you can always come

146
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,360
forward and say here's my signing

147
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,949
randomness you know you shouldn't do

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,599
this but here's my secret key here's my

149
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,860
signing randomness you can run the

150
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,700
encryption you can run the signing

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,410
algorithm yourself and you can see

152
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,599
that that this signature is produced so

153
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,000
in order to have a meaningful notion of

154
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,710
unclaimed ability we need to guarantee

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,120
that non signers can also produce fake

156
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,520
signing randomness that looks real so

157
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,230
even though I might remember the signing

158
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,940
randomness and be able to produce it

159
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:16,270
later anyone else in the ring can also

160
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,520
later come up with with with convincing

161
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,010
fake signing randomness and claim that

162
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,680
they produce this signature using this

163
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,690
other signing venomous so nothing so

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,690
nothing I say later this would be

165
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,900
convincing to guarantee that I signed

166
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:35,380
and that I produced the signature now

167
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,349
this this this guarantee feels somewhat

168
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,280
in the flavor of deniable encryption

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:43,090
where you also want to produce

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,909
explaining randomness for it for a for a

171
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,460
ciphertext but it's somewhat

172
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,220
surprisingly a deniable encryption seems

173
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,799
to require very heavy and machinery like

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,630
indistinguishability obfuscation but in

175
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,010
contrast this notion of unclaimed

176
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:03,730
ability were able to achieve from

177
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:05,380
standard lattice assumptions so so sort

178
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,080
of the intuition behind the guarantee of

179
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,850
unclaimed ability is that any anything

180
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,070
that can be produced by the true signer

181
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,840
can also be simulated by any other

182
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,040
member of the Ring and we can even

183
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,099
require that the simulation is

184
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:22,930
information theoretic so so in this work

185
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,810
we define these four notions of ring

186
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,900
signature schemes and we construct each

187
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,160
of them we can start clear involving

188
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,810
signature schemes and a generic

189
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,960
transformation from any ring signature

190
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,350
scheme I'm claiming bull from sis

191
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,600
lattice assumptions and reputable ring

192
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,640
signatures from verifiable random

193
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,940
functions and the fourth variant

194
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,860
unrepeatable we show is implied by the

195
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,360
stronger of the notion of the

196
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,140
pre-existing additions of ring

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,640
signatures that I presented earlier ring

198
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,370
signature is anonymous against Phil key

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,970
exposure so in this talk I'll focus on

200
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,970
the other three

201
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,390
to give some so our work also gives some

202
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,110
taxonomy of the landscape of ring

203
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,910
signatures we we can show that

204
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,490
unclimbable is a stronger definition

205
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,610
than unrepeatable it implies it and also

206
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,770
playable and reputable ring signatures

207
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,390
are compatible notions so we can have a

208
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,060
single ring signature scheme that's both

209
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,230
claimable and repeatable and the other

210
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,849
thing i want to mention is that the

211
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,500
claim bowl and unclimbable are not

212
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,839
opposites and neither repeatable and

213
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,830
unrepeatable you can have a signature

214
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,620
scheme that's neither

215
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,540
for instance if claiming requires

216
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,089
remembering signing randomness our

217
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,860
nation of claim bowlers is is stateless

218
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,900
but you can have a notion where you can

219
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,630
claim some of the time or only if you're

220
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:54,560
stateful so there's room for four

221
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:56,480
definitions in between as well so for an

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,079
outline of the rest of the talk I'm

223
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,300
gonna I'm going to talk about construe

224
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,010
three notions of clam bowl unclaimed

225
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,810
bull and repeatable ring signatures and

226
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,280
constructions for them so I'm going to

227
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,010
start with the simplest to build which

228
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,010
is claim bull ring signatures and we're

229
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,350
gonna so to remind you a ring signature

230
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,630
is claimable if the signature torii can

231
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,300
later come forward and and reveal their

232
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:24,800
identity and and prove that they were

233
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,510
the signer so the the intuition for this

234
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,699
is that if we could remember the signing

235
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:33,560
randomness it seems like if we if we

236
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,330
build things carefully this should

237
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,900
constitute a reasonable this should

238
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,250
constitute a convincing claim there's

239
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,569
two issues that we need to deal with we

240
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,310
need to make sure that the signing

241
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,900
randomness uniquely determines the

242
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,400
signer which since I'm going to talk

243
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,140
about unclaimed ability in the next

244
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,939
section that's not true in general

245
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,490
and finally we don't want to remember

246
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,680
the signing venomous so this notion of

247
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,600
clearing bility sort of seems partway

248
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,140
between a ring signature and a standard

249
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,560
digital signature so let's start by so

250
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,120
suppose we want to take a ring signature

251
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,579
scheme and a standard digital signature

252
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,870
scheme and combine them so if we want to

253
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,370
assign a message we can produce

254
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,070
signatures under both scheme

255
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,430
but in order to preserve anonymity we

256
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:24,500
can't release the digital signature

257
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:26,989
signature so we can so so we might mask

258
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,870
it using a commitment and then the

259
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,910
signature that we can produce is

260
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:36,200
consists of a ring signature and also a

261
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,120
commitment to a standard signature and

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,880
then the other thing we want to we have

263
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,680
to worry about is we don't want to

264
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,640
remember assigning randomness so we can

265
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,229
we can sort of store a compressed

266
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,840
version of the sighting randomness using

267
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,520
using prfs and keep it as keeping the

268
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,320
pfk as part of the secret key and then

269
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,990
if we want to claim we can simply D

270
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,030
commit to this commitment and reveal

271
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,830
that this signature contained a

272
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,390
commitment to an ordinary digital

273
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,390
signature that's tied to my identity

274
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,089
but if I choose not to do commit and I

275
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,609
never open the commitment that it hides

276
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,260
my identity so it's also satisfies the

277
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,260
definitions of a normal ring signature

278
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,719
so now I'm going to move on to the

279
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,350
second notion unclaimed ability which we

280
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,390
built from lattice assumptions so the

281
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,000
idea of behind unclaimed ability is that

282
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:37,069
the signer cannot later come forward and

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,810
prove that they were the signer so in

284
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,580
order for this to be the case non

285
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,530
signers must be able to come up with

286
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,880
convincing signing randomness so that

287
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,860
anything produced by the signer

288
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,140
something indistinguishable can be

289
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,840
produced by any non signer in the ring

290
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:57,080
and the key technical tool for this will

291
00:12:50,840 --> 00:13:00,170
be a lattice trapdoors so our scheme is

292
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,020
a Arin claim involving signature scheme

293
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,670
is a simple augmentation of the lattice

294
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:10,790
based ring signature scheme of recurse

295
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:12,290
key ankle I so and in this scheme I'm

296
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,660
gonna in this talk I'm going to present

297
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,810
a simplified version that only allows

298
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:23,630
you to sign random messages but in the

299
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:26,449
paper we give the full scheme so the

300
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,350
public key is going to be a an sas

301
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,140
matrix

302
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:34,910
so nlw matrix with an early a random

303
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:37,100
matrix with an sis chapter and then to

304
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,730
sign a random vector you use the

305
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,220
trapdoor to generate a short vector X

306
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,370
where all of the entries are small so

307
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,140
that a times X is equal to the message y

308
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,180
and then you can just release this so

309
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:54,100
this would be a digital signature for

310
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,650
random messages but of course it reveals

311
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,150
which matrix was used to generate the to

312
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,010
generate the signature to verify you

313
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,430
need to know which public key was used

314
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:06,620
so it's not a ring signature scheme but

315
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,560
suppose that we have a bunch of

316
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,970
different a bunch of different public

317
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,280
key is generated by different parties

318
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,490
and we want to produce a ring signature

319
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,600
with respect to the set of public keys

320
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:22,310
so we can concatenate them into a matrix

321
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,440
and then we can ask we have a we have a

322
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,410
message that we want to sign we can ask

323
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,960
we want to produce a very tall vector

324
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,140
with small entries so that the matrix

325
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:38,720
vector product equals the equals the the

326
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:41,270
target message and using trapdoor

327
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,420
extension techniques you can generate a

328
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:48,079
short X using the trapdoor for any one

329
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:52,699
of these a matrices so any party in the

330
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,040
ring can do this and so basically one

331
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,030
way to see this is you can break up this

332
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,300
matrix vector product as the sum of a

333
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:05,510
bunch of products of smaller matrices

334
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,819
with with with pieces of the vector and

335
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,280
then you can say suppose I'm party to I

336
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,200
can take all of the other terms in the

337
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,910
sum and move them to the other side and

338
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:22,700
then my trapdoor to matrix 2 allows me

339
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:26,030
to produce a short vector X to that so

340
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,470
that this equation is satisfied even

341
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:32,120
though I don't know I don't know trap

342
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,110
doors for any of the other a matrices so

343
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,150
this allows me to so

344
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,510
/ images generated under different

345
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,890
trapdoors are indistinguishable so the

346
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,770
signing random is generated by different

347
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:49,050
members of the Ring are all so innocent

348
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:50,730
miserable this means that no one can

349
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,319
credibly claim authorship of a signature

350
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,970
because anything that the true signer

351
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,050
can produce could also have been

352
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,670
produced by any other member of the Ring

353
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,120
so what I described here is a simplified

354
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,790
scheme that for signing random messages

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,710
but using the same transformations used

356
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,020
by Burke Erskine kalai we can turn this

357
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:15,630
into a unclaimed blowing signature

358
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,670
scheme for arbitrary messages so now I

359
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,660
want to turn to the final part of the

360
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,810
talk where I'm going to talk about

361
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,449
repeatability which we construct from

362
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,839
verifiable random functions so in a

363
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,970
reputable ring signature non signers are

364
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,650
able to prove that they were not

365
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,810
responsible for signing the message that

366
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,069
some other party of the ring in the ring

367
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,300
can sign the message what was the party

368
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,880
that signed the message so this really

369
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,030
consists of two separate guarantees

370
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,580
firstly we want to make sure that even

371
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:50,040
in the presence of a malicious signer

372
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:53,310
non signers are always able to repudiate

373
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,370
in the scheme and secondly we want to

374
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,130
make sure that no signer can later

375
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,420
repudiate if they want to distance

376
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:05,359
themselves from a message that they

377
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,560
actually produced so the key ingredients

378
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,760
the building blocks for our scheme are

379
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,139
zaps and brf's zaps are to message

380
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,530
public coin witness indistinguishable

381
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,080
proofs and vrf serve verifiable random

382
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,629
functions are pseudo-random functions

383
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,550
that also have the capability to release

384
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,770
a proof of the output associated with

385
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,629
any individual input without

386
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:34,020
jeopardizing residual pseudo randomness

387
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:36,030
of any other input so suppose we wanted

388
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,250
to use the vrf to produce a ring

389
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:42,780
signature well what we might do is we

390
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,670
say okay we can we can use the message

391
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,800
as the input to the VF and we can

392
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,610
produce an output and then we can also

393
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,980
prove that

394
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,020
that output is correct so the the public

395
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,059
key would consist of the public key and

396
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,820
then to sign a message you can release a

397
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,040
vrf evaluation and proof of the message

398
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,040
the problem is of course that this is

399
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,470
tied to an identity so we might want to

400
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:10,260
try to hide which identity was used to

401
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:13,650
produce the signature by using a sap you

402
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,660
know this isn't going to work so and the

403
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,580
SAP will say this is the right message

404
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,450
that this is the right output for the

405
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,699
vrf on input the message this isn't

406
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,549
going to work because apps provide only

407
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,870
a witness indistinguishability guarantee

408
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,010
so if there's only one witness they

409
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,439
don't actually hide it they're not

410
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,660
guaranteed to hide anything so this

411
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,160
won't this won't hide which member of

412
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,080
the Ring was responsible for producing

413
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,270
the signature it does give a digital

414
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,639
signature but not a ring signature so

415
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,760
instead let's try let's try to use two

416
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,980
VR FS and then use this app to prove the

417
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,270
statement that either the output under

418
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,110
the first three ref is correct or the

419
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:56,070
output under the second is correct and

420
00:18:51,110 --> 00:19:00,120
here like in the security proof we can

421
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:02,100
switch from we can switch from using the

422
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,389
vrf of one party in the ring to the vrf

423
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,379
of another party in the ring so we can

424
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,809
get the unanimity definitions of a ring

425
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,790
signatures this does give a ring

426
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:15,178
signature but then when we want to

427
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:17,190
repudiate we have to show that that both

428
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:21,510
of these vrf output sisk is incorrect

429
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:24,929
and to do this we sort of we we still

430
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,850
can't do this I mean we can do this once

431
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:31,559
by sort of revealing our key material

432
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,629
and showing that these are these are the

433
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,040
these are the wrong values that my vrf

434
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,080
outputs are different but then I'm

435
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,940
revealing my vrf outputs and anyone else

436
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,129
can forge the same message the same

437
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,220
message under my key so we don't want

438
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,750
we'd so this is not good we want to make

439
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,240
sure you can repeat it over and over

440
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,450
again as many times as you want without

441
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,280
violating an anaemic without without

442
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,919
violating anonymity of later messages

443
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,200
that you sign and without allowing the

444
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,390
adversary to forge on messages that you

445
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,530
repudiate so this isn't going to work

446
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,350
either

447
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:10,710
so one didn't work two didn't work let's

448
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:12,090
try let's try four okay so now the

449
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,570
statement we want to use the self to

450
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,060
prove is that one of the first to v RF

451
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:21,659
outputs is correct and one of the last

452
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,070
year v RF outputs is correct and then

453
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,810
our signature will consist of the Zap

454
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:30,149
proof and the four outputs so now in

455
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,830
order to repudiate we want to show the

456
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,580
opposite of this statement we want to

457
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,939
show that if I want to repeat it I want

458
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,740
to show that for my key either one of

459
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,570
the first two outputs is incorrect

460
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,170
either both of the first two outputs is

461
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,629
incorrect

462
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:50,940
or both of the second apples or it is

463
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:54,270
incorrect so in order to do this I can

464
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,540
produce vrf proofs of each of these I

465
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:00,240
can produce a I sorry I can evaluate the

466
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,310
via naívi RF on the message and produce

467
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,840
these output values y1 prime and y 2

468
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:08,850
Prime and then I can prove that that my

469
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,020
v RF outputs are different

470
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,570
using a zap and then the other two

471
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,000
values Y 3 Prime my four prime are not

472
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:21,120
used in the honest repudiation but

473
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,990
they're used in the proof to two hybrid

474
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,399
over two hybrid from one from

475
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,470
repudiation under one signer to

476
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,870
repudiation under another signer and to

477
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,640
show that releasing these repudiation x'

478
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:38,070
does not jeopardize the other properties

479
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,590
that we want so to summarize we present

480
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,629
four new variants of ring signatures

481
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,409
claimable repeatable unclimbable and

482
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,260
unrepeatable

483
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:51,360
that provide functionality for allowing

484
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:53,490
members of a ring to to prove that they

485
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,780
were or were not responsible for for

486
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:59,550
producing it a particular signature and

487
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,280
also definitions that guarantee that

488
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,050
there should be impossible we all we

489
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,399
give constructions of these from various

490
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,180
and we give constructions of these from

491
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:14,569
various assumptions thanks very much

492
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,979
[Applause]

493
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:18,749
right Thank You Adam we have a little

494
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:20,309
bit of time for questions if you have a

495
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:22,259
questions please step up to the

496
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:42,418
microphones in the aisle so that

497
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:44,099
everyone can hear you so the question is

498
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,139
can we transform the unclaimed bill

499
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,869
construction from sis into a claimable

500
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,248
one so you can take any ring signature

501
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,259
construction and transform it into a

502
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,759
claimable one but if you start with one

503
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,409
that's unclimbable once you apply the

504
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,359
transformation will do it will no longer

505
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:59,699
be unclaimed it will no longer be

506
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,228
unclaimed Abul so you can you can turn

507
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:03,179
it into a claimable one but then you'll

508
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:17,339
you'll lose the structure that made it

509
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:24,779
unclaimed if you have an unconditional

510
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:32,039
what they say they'll be three

511
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:34,199
signatures by the secret key for any

512
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:40,199
secret key you can find the randomness

513
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:41,969
in the group so it would be so I'm not

514
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,949
sure the particular constructions you're

515
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:47,369
referring to but if you can produce

516
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:50,879
randomness for any signature that that

517
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,978
is indistinguishable from if if any

518
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:54,329
member of the Ring can produce signing

519
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:55,979
randomness that's indistinguishable from

520
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:59,479
real signing randomness for a particular

521
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:59,479
signature than it would be unclaimed

522
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,820
so thanks for the question in the

523
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,789
designated so in our definition of clam

524
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,289
bullring signatures there's no

525
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:24,809
designated honest party and the

526
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:28,200
definition you're referring to my

527
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,360
understanding of it is that you can at

528
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,419
the time of signing you can refer to you

529
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,789
can designate some public party who's

530
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,590
who's identified who can who later has

531
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:39,809
the ability to Dianna Mize you whenever

532
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,668
they want and our signature there's no

533
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:53,428
public party there's no trusted parties

534
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:55,110
at all in our claim but the designated

535
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:56,730
party candy anonymize here so you're not

536
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,178
anonymous with respect to the party that

537
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:09,299
you designate it's my understanding I'm

538
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:11,279
we can talk offline signatures because

539
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,090
the step-out ring signatures also has

540
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,090
this property

541
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:25,549
so I need to I need to look at the paper

542
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,549
you're referring to I'm not I'm not sure

543
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,100
thank you all right I think to add them

544
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,230
again

545
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,230
[Applause]
