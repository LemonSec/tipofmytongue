1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,440
a machine loo from osaka kyoto

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,690
university this joint work of is an

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,700
indiana tahu

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,540
in this talk we are introduced public

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:23,320
key encryption and is titled

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,299
resilient material in city security then

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,970
I will introduce a new concept namely

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,539
quasi adaptive Harsha proceeding and

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:35,339
different two new properties for for

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,870
this hot proceeding then I will show

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,510
generic construction of public link

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,199
encryption from quasi adaptive hockey

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,070
team and prove and show how to achieve

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,160
with Heights

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,010
wicked resilient multi-talented CCA

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,260
security also gives some installations

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,250
about how the adaptive Harper C team and

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,649
conclude the talk now a public key

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,920
encryption scheme consists of three

20
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:07,360
areas key generation encryption and

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,819
decryption well it happens that under a

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,050
same public aid there might be a lot of

23
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:16,090
a separate extra for example if for

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,450
server server may receive a lot of

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,369
attending the a lot of server attacks hi

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,709
did for him and thus in the better

27
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:27,060
clients so how to protect the message

28
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:30,819
hidden in the huge amount of server text

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,429
so sup for public encryption we define

30
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,759
the traditional standard escrow notion

31
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:38,920
is a CCA security so it is an

32
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,039
indisputable security against the chosen

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,440
ciphertext attack it characterized by a

34
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:46,840
security game played by a challenger

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,229
anniversary for the anniversary

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,750
it knows public key it has access to

37
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:55,660
multiple access to encryption Oracle and

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,470
a deep decryption article for encryption

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:02,140
Oracle it view all put a sequence were

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,229
challenged separate acts and for the

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,840
decryption our code will do a decryption

42
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,780
services for the adversary but it

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,299
refused to decrypt Italian Asafa texture

44
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,230
the CCA security requirement

45
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,560
requires data the third sequence our

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,810
tally no serve attacks

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,569
it's true to be hard for the adversary

48
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,910
to tell whether the challenges of

49
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:28,429
attacks are the encryption of the left

50
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,620
some messages of the encryption of the

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,080
right message even the two sequences of

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,030
messages are to them as a theater

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:42,160
bursary since a security is your lay is

54
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,739
damper a security reduction if there's

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,239
the worst or a brake assist a secret

56
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,480
game then may construct another

57
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,739
algorithm a PBT algorithm B which so a

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,100
had a problem this is your relation that

59
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:02,030
the security doctrine in earlier shows

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,720
that is advantage your lay upon D the

61
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,360
biosecurity Loss Factor L times the

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,930
monthly gob and the secret a loss factor

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,510
if it is if it is a constant or at least

64
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,380
a linear to the secret parameter then we

65
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,620
call it a patsak reduction with a

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,209
particular doctrine it is durable

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,690
because it we can avoid security

68
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:33,769
argument that impose into the into the

69
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,980
secret into the into the public a scheme

70
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:39,769
so we can make it more efficient that

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:46,220
why wait we focus on higher to security

72
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:47,930
reduction it well known that the single

73
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,780
channel in the city security implies

74
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,600
Mokpo telling the city security by a

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,109
simple hybrid arguments we can prove

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,570
this secret reduction and the discreet

77
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,970
doctrine parameter is Q where Q is a

78
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,190
number of the challenges of attacks or

79
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,829
the number of the increment query

80
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,079
made by the anniversary this secret

81
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:14,720
security deduction is not a paid one

82
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,090
recent years a lot of work focusing on

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,100
how to team Matt Italian disease is

84
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,619
security

85
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,220
most of them use to protease why

86
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,900
approach is to make use non interactive

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,030
with your knowledge proofs a team and

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,270
the other user variant so how to proceed

89
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,270
him

90
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,680
on the other hand we can also adapt the

91
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:40,159
mati Italian the city security into a

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,800
liquid resilient setting in those ways

93
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:43,520
anniversary who can implement such an

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,650
attack

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
in that case the diverse room may know

96
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,080
some information about secret key so

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,759
tomorrow that we allow a diverse array

98
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:59,688
to query a liquid Oracle and the Oracle

99
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,310
will will reveal some information of the

100
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,310
secret key to the other bursaries of

101
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,949
course we away have assumption that the

102
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,680
Nicator Oracle at any case the total

103
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:13,099
metallic Adria is a bonded so it is a

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,490
liquid abandoned model so in this way we

105
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:20,199
can we can define a decay resilient

106
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:23,240
Martita Linda sees a security notion

107
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,159
after now all they're the only word only

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,620
one work that achieve we fish in the

109
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:30,370
annotated a leaky resilient am a teacher

110
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,669
induces a secure a public key encryption

111
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:37,819
that is the fire that is done by a P et

112
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:40,270
al in 2013 it'll make use of a

113
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:44,529
non-interactive was your knowledge

114
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:49,549
system to achieve with attached security

115
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:53,300
but society the public key and the 7800

116
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:56,330
had is a is a very large so in this work

117
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,819
we will try to solve the problem in

118
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:04,279
another way and the resulting more

119
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:09,189
efficient public encryption so up in our

120
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:12,889
approach the building that technical

121
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:17,150
attack in your building block is a quasi

122
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:19,449
attacked him how to proceed him so for

123
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,239
such a harsh precedium

124
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:26,419
it a defines a heart function over a set

125
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,689
X and as a hash function is indexed by

126
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:33,109
the security key as K and on the other

127
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,439
hand it is associated with a collection

128
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,909
of languages remember that for the

129
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,610
traditional Harsha proceeding move

130
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:41,330
introduce a bactrim group for each heart

131
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,180
receding

132
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,620
it is associated with a fixed language

133
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,320
but now we are

134
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,500
with a collecting of language and we can

135
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,889
protect the secret key in two different

136
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,710
languages as a result we have a

137
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,020
collection of a production case and each

138
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,419
protection case depends on the languages

139
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,940
that's why we call our heart proceeding

140
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:10,520
party adaptive similarly for each for

141
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,820
each infant in the set X we can evaluate

142
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,130
the Hartree team as a hash value with

143
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,030
the stupid key but if the instance in

144
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:22,880
the language LF any language LR we can

145
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,580
evaluate the heart value but the

146
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,139
production key all the language together

147
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,698
with the witness over the the instance

148
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,380
so there are two modes to evaluate the

149
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,690
heart of a neo if the intent in the

150
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:39,860
language and the yellow 0

151
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,840
Allah Allah - now we defend as such a

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,210
how to proceed with the two new

153
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,030
properties and the properties are

154
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:51,638
parameterize the typical property the

155
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:56,030
first one is al 0 L 1 universal property

156
00:07:51,639 --> 00:08:00,560
it said that even that's a to protection

157
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,900
case on languages 0 L 0 and L 1 for any

158
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,680
instance that nothing in the language 0

159
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:10,520
and L 1 then that value is U is a pseudo

160
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,430
either is uniformly distributed so what

161
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,460
that mean it means if the secret key is

162
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:20,539
uniformly distributed so so it has our

163
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,150
full entropy so given to protection case

164
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,380
our two languages then we have a

165
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,359
security

166
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:32,000
loss however their remaining entropy in

167
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,810
the secret cave will guarantees that the

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,390
heart failure our X is uniformly

169
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,539
distributed as long as the instance is

170
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,750
true they need a language l 0 now in L 1

171
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,880
because this is a universal property so

172
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,920
another property is

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:57,170
l0 l1 Christian keeps meeting property

174
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:58,939
or I said that given to to public

175
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,860
protection keys

176
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:06,560
illunga dl0 and Elwha it is that it is

177
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:10,790
statistically close to to protecting

178
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,709
keys on the lambda LCR a while but with

179
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:18,560
two independent the security case more

180
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,380
precisely if the secret secret key is

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,680
uniformly distributed we can compute a

182
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,260
to protection case but we always replace

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,569
the to protection case to another one

184
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:34,640
another tool and another to each atom is

185
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,940
protecting the fur armor an independent

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,550
secret decay so to inhibit so one secret

187
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:45,980
key is replayed to to inhibit a secret

188
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:49,430
case another important property is

189
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,050
alvaro multi-tracking properties it said

190
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,380
when the secret key is uniformly

191
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,829
distributed for several instantly

192
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,680
randomly chosen from a language l 0 then

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:06,320
such values with those instances are

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:09,199
pseudo-random we can always exchange the

195
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,450
two properties for cause adaptive or how

196
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,370
to proceed humor into liquid resilience

197
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,400
idea that meaning if the two properties

198
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,910
in universal and kiss meeting is also

199
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:23,060
heard in the presence our Killa Kate

200
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,949
then we call that properties are equally

201
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,010
resilient Universal and the liquid

202
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:31,190
resilient kiss meeting and then Sahara

203
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:36,530
proceeding became ke ke

204
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:39,650
Lily Lily resilient one now we are ready

205
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,020
to to show our construction or public

206
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,680
encryption from a quasi adaptive Harsha

207
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:50,630
precedium

208
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:55,130
it make it makes use of three part 3

209
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:57,650
quadratic adaptive how to proceed him so

210
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,830
the secret key consists of the three

211
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:06,199
keys so 3 harbour city MO has three keys

212
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:09,230
and the public key of the PPE consists

213
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,420
of the three protection case over the

214
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,590
three secret key and all the protective

215
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,420
case are the same lon

216
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:20,810
l know let's see how to encrypt a

217
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,150
message m to encrypt a message Emma

218
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,869
first we'll run into the instance from

219
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,790
language L say what we compute three hot

220
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,250
values because we have three hash

221
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,280
proceedings the three the first hash

222
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,550
value is used to hide the message so we

223
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:42,459
community is the first heart value Class

224
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:45,709
M method and then we prove that this

225
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,330
subject is valid will confuse the second

226
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,310
hash value under third heart value and

227
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,070
we add them all together and the value

228
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:57,380
is funded to approve path so the server

229
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:59,420
taxing is a instant X D and a path to

230
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,450
decrypt a separate X and subtracting is

231
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,310
X deeper we can always use the three

232
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,680
simple case for the three hard proof

233
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,199
sees him to compute three heart videos

234
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,359
one heart well you to re uncover the

235
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,060
method and the other two are value to

236
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,670
edit the map gets value to check whether

237
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,510
it is equal to the proof I in the

238
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,120
subtext if it is the way we output the

239
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:28,790
method otherwise we think that we take

240
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,740
it as an invalid value jacket okay so

241
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,319
correcting issues are also followed from

242
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,780
the correctness of the three has proved

243
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,460
settings now let's see how to achieve

244
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,640
with high tamati italian assist a

245
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:43,130
security remember that he always is

246
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,910
easily the game at the other was Ray has

247
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,790
it he can see the public key he has a

248
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,800
magical

249
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:57,110
queries encryption Oracle and a

250
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:59,510
decryption Oracle so now let's to to

251
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,970
prove the proof procedure is five steps

252
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,819
the first step that we make a chain in

253
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,460
the encryption Oracle

254
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,230
instead our evaluates the hash value of

255
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,630
the three harsh radios we make

256
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,380
encryption Sasori three Harsha values we

257
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:17,300
do not use a public evaluation mode by

258
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,790
the pro technically now we all stop

259
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,430
secret key to computer Sri Hari knows

260
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,920
that always because the instance are

261
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,108
chosen from language al does the

262
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,878
equivalent

263
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:31,909
the second step is also a change in the

264
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,979
encrypted Oracle now we change the

265
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:38,779
language in the increment Oracle from

266
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:40,699
language L to another language l 0 so

267
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,159
that means that when we generate the

268
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:46,969
scallion of saffat extra we choose

269
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:49,729
instance X not from L but from another

270
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:54,409
language L 0 this is also ok because our

271
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:58,189
subset a membership a problem the first

272
00:13:54,409 --> 00:14:00,679
step is wait we do a change in the

273
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:03,649
decription oracle so for the decree

274
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:06,470
miracle we read decrypt the ciphertext

275
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,259
which is ax e pad we will check the ins

276
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:14,149
in the x if it is not in the language al

277
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:16,509
we reject it immediately and this we

278
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,799
will show this is this chin is in

279
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,859
distinguishable because I will check

280
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,909
dilemma this lemma we will be justify 8

281
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,739
line later

282
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:31,220
now we skipped it because it to

283
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:35,089
complicate it okay now now so increase

284
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,999
your call only only only working on

285
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:42,859
language l 0 the decrement orko only

286
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:45,319
work on language ax l okay so the

287
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:47,419
behavior of the two Oracle's in fact can

288
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:54,319
be characterized by the protected keys

289
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:58,429
ah language l 0 and L now we can use the

290
00:14:54,319 --> 00:15:02,118
ll0 kiss meeting property of the first

291
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:04,579
part precedium that means the project to

292
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:08,269
protect protection case and the same

293
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:10,008
secret key can be replaced by to protect

294
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,829
kids but with two different and

295
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:16,009
independent of security so we change the

296
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:19,998
CD key working on language l working on

297
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:23,149
language l 0 in the encryption article

298
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:26,619
in the incremental oracle change change

299
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:29,929
it into a totally new secret key

300
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:32,539
okay now the increment or co use a new

301
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,850
new case that if different of rama's are

302
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:36,670
secretly in the public key different

303
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,380
from the ok

304
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:44,439
in the dick recruitment article so this

305
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,210
new K is used to compute our value which

306
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,590
is high that the method is in the

307
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:56,710
separate acts now according to the L

308
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:59,800
according to the l0 mati tracking

309
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,690
property of the first half precedium all

310
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,449
the hash values a pseudo-random or we

311
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,850
can replace them into a truly random of

312
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,730
values if they are truly random of

313
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:15,340
values then they are perfectly had all

314
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,560
the plinth acts then the secretary then

315
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:21,040
we are thus the CCE security we are

316
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,930
there but we are all of them because we

317
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,079
skip an important lemma which is

318
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:32,560
rejection Emma so we have we go back to

319
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:35,380
step 3 in step 3 we see that if for

320
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,349
decryption given a server tax if the

321
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,750
instance in the favor tax is not belong

322
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,940
to the language L we reject it

323
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:48,730
immediately now we show that if X is not

324
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:51,100
is not belong does not belong to lambda

325
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:55,390
L then this equations the checking

326
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,910
equation will not hold so this is a

327
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,420
rejection lemma so we defined an even

328
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,389
too bad we will show that bad happens

329
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,159
hardly it was a probability the bad

330
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:15,520
happening is negligible so this will our

331
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:17,980
goo now I see in step 3 we see

332
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,040
encryption Oracle only work on lambda L

333
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,319
0 degree or co-own lyrical angry L so

334
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:29,460
all the behavior are characterized by

335
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:35,649
the protecting keys 0 and RL

336
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:37,980
then according to the ow l 0 universal

337
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,650
property of the second heart precedium

338
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:45,010
then for any instance that that is not

339
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,740
in the l0 language there is this this

340
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,460
this ha ha value will be uniformly

341
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,080
distributed

342
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,989
so this increasing

343
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,668
we will not hold the bed will not happen

344
00:17:52,989 --> 00:18:01,809
that so we can always put X from l0 in

345
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:05,259
this condition in we were talking about

346
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:11,799
we all only dyskinesia is satisfied can

347
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:14,980
we attract a pet in that case when we

348
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,950
check mate check check a bed we also use

349
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,309
protecting protecting keys are all zero

350
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,070
so encryption decree narco which hack

351
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:31,059
bad the three passes replace only use

352
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:34,779
protection case language L and L 0 now

353
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,700
according to l l0 keep switching

354
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:40,389
property over the second and the third

355
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,269
harbors idiom we can always change keys

356
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:47,559
now we change the case that appears in

357
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,600
l0 now only in the case for the second

358
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,289
and the third heart will say team say

359
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,309
already know why is a is s K hat XK

360
00:18:53,289 --> 00:19:01,029
tilde now the new wise SP hide pram as

361
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:04,690
key to the pram so so lambda L 0 we

362
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:19,379
replace new replaced with a new with new

363
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:22,539
- new secret keys ok now let's see now

364
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:25,719
encryption or Coty Clarke oh we have a

365
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:28,929
new case old case but it's a new Kyoto

366
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,580
crease old Keesey they are all projected

367
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:48,389
on al 0 or L so according we can again

368
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:51,249
we can use so now we can we can we can

369
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,320
partition the instance in the encryption

370
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:55,690
Oracle when generating that hell in the

371
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,269
subtext for all the telly receptors are

372
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,730
all the instance now originally they are

373
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:04,590
from our 0 now we're packaging it into

374
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:08,559
two languages so half of them

375
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,928
half of them will come from l0 and the

376
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,330
other half will come for lol one

377
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,370
according to the serial number of

378
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,379
Italian staff attacks if they are

379
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,049
foretelling the subtext we'll choose the

380
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:21,789
first one first to instantly from our

381
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,149
zero under the other two years in the

382
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:26,379
froma

383
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:28,750
and one inside the case in increment

384
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:32,408
Oracle the secret a new ship decay are

385
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:38,320
protected now in not only in a language

386
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:40,509
L 0 but all but also L 1 now we can use

387
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,980
our zero Alma universal property over

388
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:45,490
the second harsh precedium

389
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:49,059
and the put condition in check or bet

390
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:54,850
this condition only acts belong to the

391
00:20:49,059 --> 00:21:06,908
Union of Iran I want to recheck a bad ok

392
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:08,860
and under this next let's see all the

393
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,750
protection case all of all the

394
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,559
protection case that work working on a

395
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:17,710
zero and alwa now we can use the key

396
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,080
switch in property we can put the two

397
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:25,629
one case into two case for the third

398
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:27,939
half proceeding similarly we now

399
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:30,580
repartition all the instances in the

400
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,740
encryption oracle we applications

401
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,299
instance according to a second bit of

402
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,120
the serial number of the challenges of

403
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:40,750
attacks in that case all the new case

404
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,439
now are projected in a zero and Elwha

405
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,350
now we use a key switch in property

406
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,289
again then to new case becomes focused

407
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:54,100
we carried our announce info become

408
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:55,809
eight eight become 11 then after log Q

409
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,209
steps the Q is a number of the

410
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,509
Challenger subjects then we will fully

411
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,700
randomized all the secret keys used in

412
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,649
the third in the third how to proceed

413
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,950
him and we recheck about they were all

414
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:12,820
Rios the new the new Lisa critic a new

415
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,850
new secret key and the Alt key only use

416
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,139
want there so with different input this

417
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,399
will be running mate

418
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,360
to distribute it so pass so bad will

419
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,420
never happen

420
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,020
okay then we we have our finished the

421
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,490
reject a lemma now let's have a quick

422
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,379
conclusion the summary of the proof will

423
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,810
be useless Universal and the case of

424
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,600
eating property and we all use log few

425
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,399
steps so we only use a log Q sub set

426
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,129
membership promises what we can achieve

427
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,740
with head security reduction but if we

428
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:47,080
can use legal reasons and universal

429
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,150
Orchestra meeting then our proof can be

430
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,990
come neatly resilient imarti telling the

431
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:56,950
city security is also had the intuition

432
00:22:52,990 --> 00:23:00,520
a cambiar is a heart procedure coming in

433
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:05,110
installation kit from a symmetric parent

434
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:08,350
group with cabeza and let's go to the

435
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,810
conclusion we introduce a concept attack

436
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,139
we harsh precedium which generalization

437
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,909
how to proceed introduced by bactrim a

438
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,040
group and we defend two new properties

439
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,530
and we also give a modular construction

440
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,110
or public encryption from this new

441
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,149
Hardcore say team and efficient the

442
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,229
installation of a symmetrical group who

443
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,880
shows that our our scheme is very

444
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,520
efficient as a publicly owned have four

445
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,440
elements and services over had over had

446
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,500
only seven elements and how the problem

447
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,030
is a symmetric confirm a problem so this

448
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,870
is before the multi fit in public

449
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,870
occasions thank you

450
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:57,000
[Applause]

451
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:59,320
we have time for a question and if there

452
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,800
is no then let's thank the speaker again

453
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,800
[Applause]
