1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,830
okay thank you for introduction so my

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:14,379
name is to use the sake and oh this so

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,340
actually we had the similar incident at

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,740
first talk I mean the co my colleague

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,050
dampens the way and Italian the way

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,299
worked really hard and they wanted to

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,520
come here to present the results but for

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,260
23 day fits them with the issue and

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,170
that's the reason I'm in presenting the

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:37,360
paper okay so this talk is about

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,730
cryptanalysis on Morris and this so

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,500
first I'd like to give overview of our

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,930
results and without mentioning a

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:49,600
technical details and the second part is

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,379
technical details which is automated try

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:58,000
to search and to do it we have to solve

17
00:00:53,379 --> 00:01:00,820
some problems and we propose the way to

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,059
solve the problem which is particular to

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,090
the ciphers which used under gates for

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,459
the source of non-linearity and third

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:14,729
part I give some detailed analysis on

22
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:16,300
Morris okay so this slide shows the

23
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,800
fundamental knowledge about

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,090
authenticated encryption so on privacy

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,720
and authenticity

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:30,670
are two basic notions which is required

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:33,280
for secure communication and the

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,399
previously encryption and Mac are

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,640
independently computed to provide both

30
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:42,849
privacy in the authenticity and also

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,149
include gated an encryption is only in

32
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,670
one approach so this simplified is the

33
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:51,849
security discussion or this simple parts

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,489
the some issues for implementations and

35
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:56,590
the moreover we can enjoy some higher

36
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:05,080
performance by sharing the computation

37
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:08,140
of Mac and encryption and from 2014 the

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,739
community had some competition to select

39
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:14,500
portfolio of authenticated encryption so

40
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:18,130
this is called the Caesar so the

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,890
competition started from 2014

42
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:27,040
with 58 candidates and most notably the

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,290
last round has started from March 2018

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,640
and the seven candidates was selected

45
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:37,500
for the final round and this year six

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:41,230
schemes what chosen are the portfolio

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,630
but this is the list of seven final run

48
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,290
candidates and avataq target Morris in

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,829
the center and this is a six final

50
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,350
portfolio and so you can see that Morris

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,510
was not chosen we guess that about tax

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:02,230
I've acted to the decision okay so the

53
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:11,079
Morris has three members depending on

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:13,750
state slice and key size and so the

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,270
confidentiality it depends on key size

56
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,160
and the integrity is always the 128 bits

57
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,900
and the bottom table compares the

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,510
results of the previous work and this

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,330
one now actually the biggest version of

60
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,480
Morris has already been attacked at AJ

61
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,330
crypt two thousand eight ten and the

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,480
complexity was a to this one pipe too so

63
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,300
it's a bit high expensive they do to

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,149
disk complexity it the talk couldn't be

65
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,410
applied to smaller version of Morris

66
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:51,370
which cranes security up to 128 bits and

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,340
in this research we found linear trails

68
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,920
with much higher correlation which

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,800
requires only two DC 76 data complexity

70
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:05,109
and a time complexity and this allows us

71
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:09,990
to attack old versions of amorous okay

72
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:12,730
so I try to explain linear trellis arch

73
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:16,090
this is the very basics of the linear

74
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:22,000
cryptanalysis so suppose we have an

75
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:24,489
event E which occurs with probability 1

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,180
over 2 plus minus Epsilon and we say

77
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,599
that this has bias epsilon and then the

78
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,449
correlation is defined as double of the

79
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:38,080
buyers and the weight is its negative

80
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:40,539
log Elizabeth so let's consider the case

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,990
of a linear approximation of an

82
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:46,599
operation and so we consider the

83
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,949
probability so which we can see the

84
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:53,589
event that bit a and bit beer goes

85
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,449
through the and gates and let's consider

86
00:04:53,589 --> 00:05:01,330
the case that we approximate it

87
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:07,539
its output as 0 the probability is of

88
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:12,099
course 3 over 4 so the buyers is 1 over

89
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:15,068
2 plus 1 over 4 is the bias is mm - to

90
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:20,619
the coordination is it's double so 2 to

91
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:23,919
the minus 1 and as a weight is 1 and we

92
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:26,199
have pining a polymer which is quite

93
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,979
convenient to calculate the correlation

94
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:36,369
of X or of similar it independent

95
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:40,300
incidence and the correlation of 2x or

96
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:43,809
event said that that code the

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,610
correlation of X or two independent

98
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:49,930
events it's just like a multiplication

99
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:54,219
of the correlation of all each event

100
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:58,749
which is quite easy okay so the planning

101
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:02,740
a polymer is very convenient but in many

102
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:04,990
cases inputs are dependent so suppose

103
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:11,169
that we have an equation why it's

104
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:17,159
completed by the that equation including

105
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:20,889
two quadratic terms and actually the

106
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:23,740
equation is illustrated in the figure so

107
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,969
the question is can we approximate it up

108
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:31,119
Y to 0 with correlation to this minus Q

109
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:35,459
well the implication is if we

110
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:39,129
approximate the first and gates to the

111
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:43,790
ones impact x2 with correlation to the

112
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:46,370
minus 1 and X the other if we

113
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,500
approximate in the second X our second

114
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,250
and gates to 0 with correlation to the

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,800
minus 1 then the result will be 0 so if

116
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,890
pining a piling up lemma applies then

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,400
the coordination that Y is 0 can be

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:06,349
calculated at the 2 to the minus 2 so

119
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,030
however oh this answer is no because the

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,640
piling up lemma only works for

121
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,640
independent approximations and this case

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,460
is dependent so we need seminar a we

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,780
need some tool to deal with dependent

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,960
and gate so so we provide an algorithm

125
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,119
to evaluate the correlation of any

126
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,270
quadratic podium function including

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,820
independent and gates

128
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:38,479
ok so today we first introduced the

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,830
concept of disjoint quadratic form so

130
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,050
the definition is as follows

131
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,500
so let F is a building function

132
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,800
quadratic building functions and the let

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,380
Sigma of FX I do you know it's the

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,290
number of quadratic terms in Burbank

135
00:07:51,380 --> 00:08:00,770
variable X I okay so at an X I XJ exciti

136
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:05,030
and XJ of F is a separated co-direct

137
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:09,789
term if Sigma for each variable is 1 and

138
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:13,880
in particular F is called disjoint if or

139
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:17,780
it's called tons are separate quadratic

140
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,540
terms the bottom demonstrates some

141
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,400
examples so let's focus on the rightmost

142
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,570
one which is not separated product term

143
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:33,760
so for this example the variable x2

144
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:36,860
appear any involved in two product terms

145
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,819
so this is not separated the quadratic

146
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:45,980
term and then example for this joint

147
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:50,690
product form each variable appears only

148
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:56,110
once in the coded terms we don't have to

149
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,110
consider the impact from linear term so

150
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,189
this is a definition of disjoint

151
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,770
quadratic form and why we introduced

152
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,290
this one because then the correlation

153
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,810
can be easily calculated by piling up

154
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,430
lemma because every time is now

155
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:17,550
independent okay so now we propose an

156
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,680
algorithm that compare that converts any

157
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,359
quadratic poonam function to a disjoint

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:28,199
quadratic form so this shows the basic

159
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,720
procedure of the transformation so let's

160
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,440
consider some vodiane function showing

161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:39,120
the Bob so which contains four quadratic

162
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:42,180
terms in the algorithm we first extract

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,470
the variable appearing most in called

164
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:51,599
arc terms in this example the variable

165
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,430
is X 2 which appears three times okay so

166
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,740
after that for the time with the

167
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,290
smallest index I mean in this case X 1 X

168
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,170
2 X replace the counterpart of the

169
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,620
variable I mean X 1 so that is the index

170
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:09,089
1 can disappear from or as a variable or

171
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:15,420
other quadratic terms so that means we

172
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:20,010
replace X 1 2 X 1 X or X 3 X 2 X 4 and

173
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:25,020
then by this replacement other quadratic

174
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:29,160
terms with X 2 disappears at the bottom

175
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,380
its results of the application we still

176
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,670
have like several other variable which

177
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:40,290
appears more than once but for the index

178
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:43,439
to the number of occurrence is only 1 so

179
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:48,569
by just applying this basic procedure

180
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:53,220
iteratively we can eventually get this

181
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:58,580
joint called that quadratic form so this

182
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:01,890
is algorithm for the for this example

183
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,990
so first is applying the basic procedure

184
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,330
so the example is the same as the

185
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,940
previous month in the previous slide and

186
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,590
so we get the second month with a

187
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,710
variable Y

188
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,470
and after we get it then a second

189
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,830
process is check if the variable for

190
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,680
non-id pv substitution means the body I

191
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,520
prefer white van appears multiple times

192
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,739
and in this example y one appears

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,650
actually twice so the answer is yes so

194
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,900
we have to go to step and if this is no

195
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,339
then we just can go back to step one and

196
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:42,329
just like a try iterate the analysis

197
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:44,880
okay so the in Step three we apply basic

198
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,730
procedures for the non IDT's habit

199
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,330
substitution terms substitution

200
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:55,050
variables so I mean in the example in

201
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:58,290
the middle we try to reduce the number

202
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:04,500
of index one to one

203
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:07,199
by doing the same same approach so after

204
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,430
the second application the number of

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,410
terms with index one is only once so we

206
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:18,329
still have the PI

207
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:21,060
twice in in two different quadratic

208
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:26,400
terms so we have to iterate the basic

209
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:30,540
procedure for g5 later but after several

210
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:37,310
more iterations we eventually get this

211
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:42,709
joint for that form okay so by using

212
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:46,349
this algorithm how we combine it with

213
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:51,990
MIP approach and then we get some good

214
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:54,089
mini trail on Morris okay so first I try

215
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,280
to introduce the overall structure of

216
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,940
Morris on centigrade authenticated

217
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,339
encryption scheme so it's three streams

218
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:08,250
like it has a stream cipher like

219
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:10,740
structure so first we have some the

220
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,600
state is in general I initialized by

221
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,150
some key and some knowns and some

222
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,600
constant and some initialization process

223
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,530
run and we also observe some associated

224
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,290
data if there is this and then step is

225
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:27,108
updated okay

226
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,738
so then so we have some updated state

227
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:33,169
and if in each step we extract this and

228
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:36,049
cleaveth by using the function G and

229
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:38,299
then the X or miss stage to produce the

230
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:41,358
corresponding ciphertext then the

231
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:43,699
message is used to update the internal

232
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:46,100
state and then this process is repeated

233
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:50,959
until oversee our mrs. Brock sy

234
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:54,649
encrypted okay well then F is a step

235
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,839
update function it looks like this

236
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:00,139
picture so I don't get into the details

237
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,859
but the important thing it's the update

238
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:06,679
function consists of just XOR and and

239
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:11,739
gates and rotation which is easy to

240
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,738
model in a mixed integer linear program

241
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:22,129
okay so this is overall structure so the

242
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:27,858
approach is approximately approximate

243
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:32,929
this is this encryption process only by

244
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:35,839
using ciphertext so in the first thing

245
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:37,850
to do is approximate ciphertext bits in

246
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,730
the first block to some internal state

247
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:46,489
so I mean lambda 0 is linear is linear

248
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,439
the approximate to gamma 0 and then the

249
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:53,139
similarly lambda 1 is approximately to

250
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:57,349
gamma 1 and so on well we also need to

251
00:14:53,139 --> 00:15:00,220
make some approximation for step update

252
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,259
function so interpret alpha 0 is

253
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,819
approximated to some beta 0 and alpha 1

254
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:11,749
is approximately two-bit one and so on

255
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:14,689
ok so because our operations are simple

256
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:16,100
this is ok this can be modeled by mix

257
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:19,879
the engineering and programming very

258
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:22,339
easily but to to be a ballad a linear

259
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:26,029
trail we have some we need to set some

260
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,829
conditions the first one is the input

261
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,230
I'm in the state after the

262
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:35,569
initialization must be all inactive and

263
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,710
the last state which is denoted by alpha

264
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:44,719
K must be also in

265
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:48,830
inactive and the son of the internal

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,770
state a must be some like a buried but

267
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:55,280
by just like imposing God conditions we

268
00:15:51,770 --> 00:16:00,319
can model the transformation by mixing

269
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,939
integer linear programming okay so so

270
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,660
this is a lot of sketch of the searching

271
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,060
procedure

272
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,910
so first in the in the preparation phase

273
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,920
so we need to pick the target number of

274
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,100
the Brock's passed of course we can try

275
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,959
several choices of K and then how we

276
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,330
model the step function and the

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,060
keystream generation by mixed integer

278
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:24,410
linear programming and by setting some

279
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:27,260
conditions are mentioned before okay so

280
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,750
after I make the model does the phase

281
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,300
one is to solve mixed integer drinkin

282
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,630
programming to find a minimum number two

283
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,760
to find the trail with minimum number of

284
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,710
octave and gates okay

285
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,890
so this just minimizes the number of

286
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:45,140
octave gates because it involves some

287
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,510
dependent on gates it doesn't really

288
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:51,560
mean that the results are like that's

289
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:55,370
best so after that in the phase 2 for

290
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,530
each solution of MLP we calculate the

291
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,310
correlation by transforming the system

292
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:03,530
to disjoin the quadratic quadratic form

293
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:09,010
this allows us to evaluate the

294
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:16,220
coordination of the entire structure

295
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:19,819
okay so so this the next two slides are

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,339
some worth like for expert which nodes

297
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,649
the previous results I mean how the beam

298
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,050
yure discovered being a trail look

299
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,870
before from the different from the

300
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:33,590
previous one

301
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:37,100
well I again don't explain the details

302
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,889
but the idea is in the median trail we

303
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,580
passed approximately ciphertext bits to

304
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,460
some some bits in the second stage ii

305
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,409
eternal state and then the second the

306
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,840
bit of second the inner internal state

307
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,020
is approximated to the fourth in the

308
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,620
intermedia

309
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,930
internal state okay but the approach

310
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:02,550
here I mean the trail here is exactly

311
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,540
the same as the previous one the new one

312
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:13,110
is in the next ride so after we get and

313
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:16,260
the bits of s for ya here after we get

314
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:21,959
the bits of s for a we approximate that

315
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:26,760
bits to X or Sam of three bits of the

316
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,880
internal state then this X or sum of

317
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:35,160
three bits is approximated to the

318
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,210
psychotics bit so after we reach one bit

319
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,550
of s4 we only need just two

320
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,400
approximations this is really like short

321
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,409
compared to previous one that's a reason

322
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,670
why about trail has much higher

323
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,650
correlation okay

324
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:58,440
so here's again the summary of the

325
00:18:52,650 --> 00:19:01,950
attack results so our trail has

326
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,470
correlation to is minus 3 mm - at 8

327
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,060
which only requires data compress need

328
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,980
to be 76 and the spun

329
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:14,190
shows the number of the products we need

330
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,130
to to complete the linear trail the

331
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,610
previous one requires 5 a message box

332
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:25,740
that we can build of a trail only by

333
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,300
using 4 message box ok so the

334
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,570
information below is about the

335
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:35,040
verification process so we tried it to

336
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:38,970
verify our trail and so the so there is

337
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,920
a smaller version of Morris proposed by

338
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,330
the previous book called the mini Morris

339
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,280
so this is like a shrink version and

340
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,639
yeah because the state is small or we

341
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,060
can experimentally bit by the

342
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,430
coordination and so we did we checked at

343
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,980
the correlation and the theoretical

344
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,460
suggested code addition is 2 to the

345
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,250
minus 8 and our verification confirms

346
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,460
that the correlation is the 2000

347
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,330
seven point seven point eight for Minnie

348
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:15,270
Morris 640 and tears - eight point one

349
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:18,990
five for bigger version with Minnie

350
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:22,680
Morris so which is quite cross and we

351
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:26,160
also did some verification of the dear

352
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,800
Morris but due to the high complexity we

353
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,830
can't do the experiment so we separated

354
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,710
the trail by fragments similar fragments

355
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,189
and bit by the correlation of the

356
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:43,350
fragments one by one and it worked very

357
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:47,820
well ok so I try to give the concluding

358
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:51,179
remarks so also we did automated

359
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:55,409
bringing a trail search on Morris and we

360
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:57,900
showed that we showed a new algorithm to

361
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,940
convert a quadratic boolean function to

362
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,550
the disjoint call that quadratic form

363
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:09,750
and the searching procedure is combined

364
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:12,300
with a MLP based automatic search and as

365
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,860
a result our we broke security cream of

366
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:21,389
all versions of amorous and so one open

367
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:25,050
problem is our algorithm is now taking

368
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:29,700
the input as quadratic podium functions

369
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:33,629
so the open program is extending this

370
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,200
conversion to deal with boolean

371
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,340
functions with degrees higher than two

372
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,610
yeah that's about it thank you for

373
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,610
attention

374
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:54,840
thank you very much

375
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:58,980
is there any questions thank you for the

376
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:02,510
network so quadratic s boxes are

377
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,510
becoming popular

378
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:15,450
can you imagine implications to those

379
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:18,990
constructions as well ah yes I think I

380
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:23,100
think it should work but we we didn't

381
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,900
try to apply to the case like that in

382
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:35,610
general yeah their conversion should

383
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:37,790
work thank you any more questions okay

384
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:41,809
then that's thank you off again

385
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,809
[Applause]
