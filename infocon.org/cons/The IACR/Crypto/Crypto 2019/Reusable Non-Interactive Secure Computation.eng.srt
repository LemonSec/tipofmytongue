1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,420
okay thank you for introduction oh thank

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,760
you

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,879
I'm going to talk nonuseful interactive

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,920
competition with Melissa afghani you

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,410
bought a new rifle and beam or time

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,199
kangan and so there are two parties

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,630
senders and receiver I was considering

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,029
the problem of like each party has the

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,780
input and they won't let the receiver

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,220
knows a function of their joint input

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,720
okay so it's called nain interactive

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,479
which means it's a two message protocol

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,729
the receiver send message to sender and

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,870
the sender returned message back the

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,309
receiver knows the output so for example

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,870
if you have the home of encryption you

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,280
get it

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,400
let the receiver send the encryption of

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,500
her data and the sender do locally

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,869
evaluation and the send encryption off

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:04,199
to back but how much encryption is quite

22
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:08,040
efficient so in the more practical one

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,039
it's using couple circulated ot so

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,740
 circuit for any input the

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,380
receiver at the sender has the sender

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,220
can compute the cobra circuit and also

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,770
two tags for each input wires such that

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,460
if you also consider the receivers input

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,330
and keep the receiver the couple struck

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,490
head and the corresponding input hacks

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,130
they truant lis review the odd foods and

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,520
nothing else computationally so this

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,130
lead to directly lead to a protocol and

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,220
I skip work on that the sender just send

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,800
the Kawasaki team playing and also use

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:54,090
of your transfer to send one tag of

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:56,340
employer so far so good but this part

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,950
have many advantage like they enjoyed or

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,880
you can use all the different

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,370
authorizations and the different

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,729
assumptions and different models it's

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,510
quite efficient and also by like you

43
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,750
Vario

44
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:15,650
ruffle mod manage and emit they actually

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,750
make this protocol maliciously secure

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,850
but what

47
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,050
I'm going to talk about today its

48
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,970
reusability so this part is not reusable

49
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,410
what as reusable mean and the why do we

50
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,180
care about we'll go back to definition

51
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,060
you should consider that the first

52
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,800
message it's not sent to the sender the

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,230
first message of the receiver is just

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,720
some public message he you can publish

55
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,390
on your favorite social media like

56
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,700
Facebook or Twitter so that the sender

57
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,649
can just grab your message formed to

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,359
your Twitter and the send your message

59
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:56,900
and then the receiver gets output okay

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,760
for ability we want the receiver doesn't

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,270
need to post a new Twitter every time

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,480
she used this protocol so one new party

63
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,280
comes a new center comes he can just

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,049
read the Twitter and use the same

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,760
message and send the receiver message

66
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,870
and the receiver should also know the

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,239
corresponding function outputs so if you

68
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,730
hire about correctness and the same only

69
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,340
security it automatically goes through

70
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,140
but will consider malicious party in

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,239
particular when the standard malicious

72
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,850
seems become quite tricky so when all

73
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,519
centered are malicious in particular

74
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,730
they can stand model message to the

75
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,920
receiver and they can learn the receiver

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,570
behavior after receiver gets message and

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,390
also they can send new message

78
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:53,239
reductively we want the port code to be

79
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:56,839
secure even under such attack ok so what

80
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,130
goes wrong with the old protocol in the

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,980
code boat protocol when the standard

82
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:04,359
malicious say the center replaced one of

83
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,298
the entry tag with with some trash and

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,600
then when the receiver gets this trash

85
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:14,989
the receiver would behave accordingly

86
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,478
and the sender might learn that if the

87
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,180
sender found oh I changed this input to

88
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,580
trash and the receivers behaviors change

89
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,440
he know the corresponding input rate and

90
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:29,310
the reach valet the security but you can

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,099
do some part

92
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:38,909
like you can instead of faith the input

93
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:41,159
in plain text to the OT Oracle you feed

94
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,590
some encoding of the input such that

95
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:44,909
like the fill bit of the encoding

96
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,169
doesn't leak any information about

97
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:51,479
inputs this way you can make it also it

98
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,960
is should be malicious security you can

99
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,669
make it secure in the one shot but not

100
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,409
in the Ryoka setting because in the

101
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,900
rules were setting the sender can repeat

102
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:06,090
attack and learn every bit of the

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,520
encoding well hopefully in such case

104
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,378
like although a few bit of the encoding

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,240
doesn't leak me put the inputting in

106
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:18,840
total would licked it and you might want

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,029
to get some small pair but our first

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,859
time in the paper shows that it's

109
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:27,150
impossible in a sense that if you only

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:32,250
rely on OT there's you cannot construct

111
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:35,400
useful and I see but our first one that

112
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,620
hacker unbounded so it's we show there's

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,628
no information circle basically you know

114
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,940
to have remote we also have a serum

115
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,620
shows that if you are willing to assume

116
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,150
like the our black box emulation they

117
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,729
are like why function and you only

118
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:52,049
consider certain functionality like even

119
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:55,289
competition why it's simple so a

120
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,349
different route it's from Isaac he then

121
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:01,378
Isaac repays the protocol like the

122
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:04,500
sender would prove that his message is

123
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,969
on its generated but in this case the

124
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,610
products typically become quite

125
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:14,610
efficient because it exactly require

126
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:16,680
none black box use of odd primitives so

127
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,020
to get round with that we consider the

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,479
arithmetic analog of ot which is called

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,258
oblivia linear function rational or in

130
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:29,789
short in such case we there is a field

131
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,740
or ring F the receivers input is just

132
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:35,759
one field element and the sender's input

133
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,219
is two filaments the odd hood is okay

134
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,839
valuator receivers input and the linear

135
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,090
function specified as by the sender

136
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,280
support

137
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,560
the first thing we'll show is like this

138
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:52,080
functionality is complete for reusable

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,910
Isaac escape in a sense that you useful

140
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,870
very happy motto you can have the

141
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,830
information you can construct

142
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:02,040
information circle you see secure

143
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:05,820
reusable a/c and of course we also need

144
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,770
to construct such photo we use a PI

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,440
layer Samsom you mention later in

146
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,659
Sierra's model here CS means a common

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:18,900
reference stream so we need to trust it

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:22,020
setup so if you consider it assuming the

149
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,650
field is binary field then o le it's

150
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,419
actually equivalent to Ooty this kind of

151
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,599
contradicts with our person result we

152
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:34,890
show that such protocol it's impossible

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,720
if it's the OT happy model therefore

154
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,080
it's not surprising we need the field to

155
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,820
be super large especially large I was

156
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,950
the code allows it's proportional to

157
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,110
it's roughly the one over the field size

158
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:55,940
so okay now I will give you a quite

159
00:07:49,110 --> 00:08:01,710
brief overview of how we construct s20

160
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:03,410
so the first one we want to use this as

161
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:10,890
black box and that's all we need to

162
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:12,750
construct I see we can sir what if we

163
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:18,210
only have a one shots okay one shot

164
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:21,060
means no useful okay when the sender is

165
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:25,950
malicious he doesn't actually have

166
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,050
well-defined input but you see security

167
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,270
is it there's a simulator the simulator

168
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:34,589
rates to input the sender sent to the

169
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,478
are Oracle and from that the the

170
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,450
simulator can extract an effective input

171
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,849
such that the receiver should output F X

172
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,200
Y star where Y starts the effective

173
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,970
input

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,589
okay I'll mention that for now my NPC

175
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,300
typically the receiver would abort or

176
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:55,110
some party to abort when they saw

177
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:59,339
abnormal behavior but in this

178
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,800
okay in the 90 of settings now abort

179
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,649
it's free in a sense that whoever the

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,079
receiver detect malicious behavior the

181
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,769
receiver can just pretend the sender's

182
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:15,449
use 7014 put this is not very important

183
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:18,860
okay so why assume you have search

184
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,510
simulator is still not reusable secure

185
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,140
the simulator absolute might be a

186
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,709
distribution in such case the receiver

187
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,829
would output also have entertained ideal

188
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:34,349
world and therefore it also have entropy

189
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:36,779
in the real world this entropy is not

190
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,120
coming from the receivers input because

191
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,420
it's secure my shots occur but it is

192
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,899
coming from the receivers randomness but

193
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,120
that's the probiotic part if it leaks

194
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:52,260
the resource randomness and the sender

195
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,750
repeat searched for cause the random is

196
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,019
liquid fruit cumulate to a degree the

197
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,899
protocols normal secure so therefore the

198
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,730
fix is quite simple we want to construct

199
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,100
a protocol where the simulator is

200
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,769
deterministic and then you check

201
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,140
everything it works well like if you

202
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,339
have one short security uses security

203
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,189
and the datum and simulator is

204
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:20,339
deterministic it's automatically uses a

205
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:23,160
queue for useful setting so let's start

206
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,880
with well let's start with so assuming

207
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,040
everything's arithmetic so the input for

208
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,120
post party it's a vector over some field

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,980
and that functionality it's a romantic

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,740
branching program or automatic and say

211
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,079
circuit and so once again we'll consider

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,160
more general general case by the very

213
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,439
end of these slides so by using

214
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,370
randomized encoding by a shy and cushy

215
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,860
oh sorry if I a new syllabus there is a

216
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:58,130
randomized encoding that the sender can

217
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:03,360
encode his input into a fix and back

218
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:07,050
such that matrix ax a times the input of

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,190
the receiver ax plus B reveals nothing

220
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:14,219
but

221
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:18,240
the output so if you only satisfied with

222
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:25,910
see me honest you can just use the oil

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:28,830
Yi as black box and there is what FXY

224
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,790
but were you okay when the sender is

225
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:36,240
malicious we want to make sure like the

226
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,969
matrix a and B is on its generated so in

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,760
particular we want to replace this oil

228
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,780
Eve that box with something we called

229
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:50,640
certified oil which is a super powerful

230
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:52,890
primitives such that if the input on the

231
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,670
sender said satisfies some constraint it

232
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,130
just evaluate a linear function but

233
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,349
otherwise the functionality

234
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,050
functionality would inform the receiver

235
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:10,940
says no like the sender is doing some

236
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:17,729
simulations so basically there are some

237
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:18,710
if there's no certified like it's just

238
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,530
some playing ie

239
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,900
but mister certified we want the we want

240
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,470
the sender to be able to prove any

241
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:31,110
Earth's Mac taken string on the

242
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:34,790
coefficients he troops so in particular

243
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,460
this implies the testing verify earnest

244
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:42,660
in or Ahmad because you can preventing

245
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:45,180
constraints but for this talk general

246
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,870
somatic constrains to heart we only

247
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,859
consider a super-simple constraint

248
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:56,370
record okay so we only consider one a a

249
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,660
I equals AJ for some IJ so this is

250
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,860
totally simplified for general

251
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,030
constraint it's only in the apron

252
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,650
okay actually even for this one we won't

253
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:11,010
fully cover it so how does it go to get

254
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,810
a favor of our construction to receive

255
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,600
her through some randomness and the fit

256
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,270
to one of the OE

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,870
Oracle and the sender rules

258
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,300
one of the coefficients and some random

259
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,120
one renfa element and receiver get aw

260
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,370
oppressor so here it happens artists

261
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,200
this oily output you should view that as

262
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:38,140
a commitment of a because yeah like as

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,780
you can check later the sender can open

264
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,180
the commitment by sending a and are to

265
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,180
the receiver and it's easy to track this

266
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:52,780
is statistically sound and zero

267
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:57,579
knowledge in our hyper-model and say

268
00:13:52,780 --> 00:14:01,000
litter the sender want to send AP use

269
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,640
abs coefficients and excise the

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,490
receivers input and let the receivers

271
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,150
know say Si plus B so this is what the

272
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,950
receiver to learn in order to do that

273
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:17,439
the receiver through the new retina

274
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:20,980
simply like for this index I and he feed

275
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,450
something something holding to the over

276
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,400
you hybrid or we have a model and now

277
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,040
the center ok the sender to something

278
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,100
else

279
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,819
let's not check the detail white or why

280
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:41,350
we trust that we can some new or your

281
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,750
outputs and there is a magic equation

282
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,270
actually equations no magic at or it's

283
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,270
like if you want to see equation to hold

284
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:57,699
you reverse engineer and you'll find the

285
00:14:49,270 --> 00:15:03,699
sister what you should fit into the so

286
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:05,380
let's check how well this for test the

287
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,680
correctness is obvious is just from the

288
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,930
equation here so for you to security

289
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,030
against the receiver when we have

290
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,579
receivers input the simulator

291
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:20,050
constructively send out word of the

292
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,970
receiver and for the wrist you see

293
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:27,370
security against the sender it's a bit

294
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:30,640
tricky actually Oh if the sender is

295
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,290
honest honest in the sense that if these

296
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,089
two coefficients

297
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,189
same coefficient and this too if is the

298
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:40,060
same coefficients the simulator can

299
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,980
instruct a efficient input but he

300
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:46,319
otherwise if the sender debate forum

301
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:49,750
hood call the similar actually cannot

302
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,040
extract the input so so we didn't prove

303
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:56,290
use the security yet but or we can show

304
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,969
that the what a receiver would output

305
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,209
when the sender debated protocol is a

306
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,860
purely random food element could we want

307
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,050
them even condition on the sender's view

308
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,029
so this is like the first half and later

309
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,370
we do a lot of things like because it's

310
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,439
this is purely random we can repeat a

311
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,560
product twice so that if they are they

312
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,089
matched and we know the sender is not

313
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,130
malicious but then it opens the door for

314
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,529
the receiver to cheat so we actually

315
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,050
okay we won't go to the in tower but we

316
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,439
go back and first ever want to get this

317
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:32,949
minimum certified oily and then based on

318
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,500
this minimize the certified OAE

319
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:38,019
we construct the complete certified so

320
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,589
this is all I want to give about the

321
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:49,089
detail of the construction of certified

322
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:51,069
or EE and our construction of SK in the

323
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,440
next I would give some brief overview

324
00:16:51,069 --> 00:17:00,219
about how we construct the to message or

325
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,649
you portico okay so it's a mat analog of

326
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,630
ot and for ot there it's a nice

327
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,179
construction by Packers in northern

328
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:13,839
waters our construction have a very

329
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:15,189
similar favored wisdom so the Comintern

330
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,579
string can be chosen from two different

331
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:23,020
distributions and that specified two

332
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:25,809
different mode involved mode you can

333
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,870
interpret the receivers message as the

334
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:32,080
encryption of his input and therefore

335
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:35,020
like the okay

336
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,460
the simulator knows the secret key of

337
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,110
the encryption so the simulator can

338
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,000
easily simulate the receiver symbol and

339
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,189
the sender's message leaks no

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,010
information other than experts

341
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,840
so in this mode its

342
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:54,580
information-theoretic Oh secure against

343
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,399
the receiver in the next mode by

344
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:02,970
changing only the saris to receive X

345
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,559
messages actually encryption of 0 and

346
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:09,480
the standard message is a corruption of

347
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:12,700
his input so therefore in this mode it's

348
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:18,520
easy to simulate and its information

349
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,559
surco against Malaysia standard and the

350
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,480
to distribution I need indistinct for so

351
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,129
we also have computational secure

352
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,130
against others and they're all received

353
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,418
so for pannier group we we won't mention

354
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,400
the detail it's a pal ulcer so pal your

355
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:40,660
encryption it's based on assumptions

356
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,440
similar to factoring but we just use it

357
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,660
as a black box there's a key generation

358
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,820
algorithm we consider we call the sacred

359
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,640
key trapdoor because actually the output

360
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,020
core no one in the real world are going

361
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,230
to use this secret key only the

362
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,520
simulator are going to use it and that

363
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,360
there's an encryption the current scheme

364
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,250
and when the randomness is zero we don't

365
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,520
need the secretary we can directly

366
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:10,510
decrypt and more

367
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:13,360
this scheme is somehow homomorphic in a

368
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,390
sense that if you multiply two separate

369
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,168
tests you get the subjects of the you

370
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,400
add to you yes you multiply two subjects

371
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,410
you'll get separate acts of their

372
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,520
addition and also the randomness is the

373
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:32,919
addition of their enemies this is all be

374
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:36,549
going to need so in the first mode we

375
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:40,440
have the CRS has two three encryptions

376
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:42,940
the first one is increasing one under

377
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,950
zero randomness the other it's just

378
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:51,490
using fresh illness and okay the sender

379
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,770
simple as I mentioned it's a encryption

380
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,330
of his input and there are a secret

381
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,730
human over here and there are publicly

382
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,070
owned lean over him sir and the random

383
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:04,340
is

384
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:06,320
about him and yes there's this descender

385
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,290
chest and the bench master back and if

386
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:14,960
you check yeah everything would work

387
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:18,889
well in the other mode we just replaced

388
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,920
one of the CS encryption with the

389
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:26,170
encryption of zero so the two Sierras

390
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,160
are in distinct role and correspondingly

391
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:33,950
correspond okay correspondingly the

392
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,750
message will change I want to mention

393
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,910
something that at this time the

394
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,550
simulator can actually behave

395
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,410
maliciously you don't know whether the

396
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,190
randomness still satisfy the right

397
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,110
correlations and in this for code

398
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,100
there's no way to detect whether the

399
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,889
sender is malicious

400
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,129
so actually we need a different

401
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,970
mechanism not mentioning the talk again

402
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,000
to detect whether the sender's malicious

403
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:10,490
so that's all I want to talk about our

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:15,380
early from patio group so quick summary

405
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:19,280
of our result we showed that you cannot

406
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:22,580
construct a nasty theory in OT hyper

407
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,490
motto without other assumptions but you

408
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,260
can do the same thing for well sorry you

409
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,850
know T without other assumptions but you

410
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:34,790
can do the same thing you re happy model

411
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:38,689
for a small cosmetic function and also

412
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:41,149
as a side product you can get Isaac hey

413
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,480
for any functions of sorry for any and

414
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:48,140
for any MP language and by combine these

415
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,820
two with Scarpa circuit you can get a C

416
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,700
for any functions but this time is no

417
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:58,010
more information circle circle against

418
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:00,860
the receiver and eventually we also have

419
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,610
a report call from hollyrock group

420
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:09,139
assumption and by compose the result we

421
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:11,600
the result we have it means we can

422
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,929
construct reusable actually and as

423
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,809
okay Impaler model sorry

424
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,990
you under patio something and the in

425
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:23,570
particular our construction its

426
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,720
information circle secured in the hybrid

427
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,080
model and our oil it's one side

428
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,700
information circle secure basing on the

429
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,220
distribution areas which means the

430
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,440
compost the one is also one study from

431
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,809
is a circle secure so in particular the

432
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,990
most interesting one it's like you can

433
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,490
stare as DK that it's one side secure a

434
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,210
once and information circle secure

435
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,250
against the receiver it means we have a

436
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,500
whole sorry this should be status code

437
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:57,530
we have a statistical technique verify

438
00:22:51,500 --> 00:23:00,140
earnest argument and another feature of

439
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:03,200
the protocol it's dark because oh it's

440
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,460
like automatic or analog of OT you can

441
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,320
actually make or the cryptography to do

442
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,010
Francis so in Auckland Facebook

443
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:17,450
construct a lot of randomized random or

444
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:20,840
re pairs and in the online phase you

445
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:24,429
just whatever you need oily you use this

446
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,260
offline computed Random randomness

447
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:29,990
information circling so therefore the

448
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,950
online phase is a non cryptography and

449
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,330
it's quite sufficient a quite efficient

450
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,570
the overall communication doesn't

451
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,889
increase yeah so that's all I want to

452
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:45,539
talk thank you much

453
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:51,039
[Applause]

454
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:52,750
is there any questions thanks for the

455
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,460
talk um so I was wondering can you

456
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,620
comment on the efficiency of your

457
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,470
protocol like the complexity

458
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,879
okay so efficiency okay uh maybe here

459
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,700
then Isaac a prophet is quite nice

460
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,669
because for each gate in the circuit you

461
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:10,990
only need to transfer a constant number

462
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:13,390
of group element but for NSC it's kind

463
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,720
of tricky so we have two way to

464
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:20,730
construct an IC one its informations

465
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,850
article but this one using the

466
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:27,250
randomized encodings of instrument

467
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,189
circuit which or branching program which

468
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:34,419
means it's only polynomially over of the

469
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:37,059
size of the bunch of programs and the

470
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,950
other one is using if you okay

471
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,658
the other one it's you if you use couple

472
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,809
circuit and you prove the cover circuit

473
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,370
it's on to generated in this one the

474
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,879
computation would because the

475
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:56,830
communication would be poly secure

476
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:58,390
parameter or for each gate so I guess

477
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,100
the follow-up question is that is there

478
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:03,220
do you think there are some hope of

479
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:10,080
eventually have this protocol applied or

480
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:17,169
used in practice okay compare with the

481
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:20,980
approach from like Isaac a based one for

482
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,600
very small circuit our port code here

483
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,950
might be quite efficient maybe more

484
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:30,370
efficient than in there but for large

485
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,490
circuit I didn't checked I didn't check

486
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:36,549
the exact number which was more

487
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:40,210
efficient but I guess we also had the

488
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:45,158
advantage of the online offline because

489
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:48,280
if you use this on my offline then like

490
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:51,039
in the online phase there's no public

491
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,440
encryption even if you use the couple

492
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,600
circuit approach which could be quite

493
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,880
efficient if you are using some big

494
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,719
device thanks

495
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,970
I guess let's let's keep the other

496
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,580
questions offline since we are running a

497
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,320
little bit behind schedule

498
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,419
yeah let's welcome the last angular

499
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,609
speaker again
