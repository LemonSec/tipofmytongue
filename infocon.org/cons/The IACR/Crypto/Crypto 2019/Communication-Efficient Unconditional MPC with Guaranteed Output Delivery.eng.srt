1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,190
thank you for introduction my name is

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,650
Yvonne sung today I'm honored to

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,170
introduce our recent work communication

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,539
efficient and conditional NPC with

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,800
guaranteed auto delivery covered with

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,800
Viper Korea and the yang Yi Liu

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,560
multi-part accommodations allows several

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,509
mutually distrusted parties to securely

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,628
evaluates a function on their private

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,949
inputs so it guarantees that the

11
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:35,930
protocol execution does not leak

12
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:37,909
anything about their individual inputs

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,149
beyond what can be inferred from the

14
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,769
function outputs so in this work we

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,109
consider the sighting where unpaired

16
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:47,960
electron evaluates an arithmetic circuit

17
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,699
over a finance field we assume the

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,989
existence of private channels between

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:57,409
every pair of parties who aim to

20
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,120
construct a protocol with and against

21
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:01,719
one sir decryption with unconditional

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,000
security and output interior guarantee

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,620
so we stress that fairness and auto

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,250
delivery guarantee are crucial in many

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,860
settings for example for voting and the

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,409
coin flipping if without fairness or

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,420
opportunity guarantee merges parties can

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,899
simply abort if the result is not

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,689
satisfactory for fair contract sending

30
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,700
enlist parties can receive the signed

31
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,070
contract we are preventing honest

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,829
parties from receiving it in this way

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:36,530
religious parties can vary the contract

34
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:38,779
where unsupported cannot so our goal is

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,939
to construct a communication efficient

36
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,429
protocol this is supported by the

37
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,678
following observation so in the

38
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:48,380
unconditional citing local competitions

39
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:51,079
are typically simple often just a series

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,089
of linear operations therefore the

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,880
efficiency of a protocol in the real

42
00:01:53,090 --> 00:02:00,469
world is dominated by its communication

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,658
complexity so by representing the circle

44
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,490
analogy as an arithmetic circuit there

45
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,030
are two main types of case we need to

46
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,890
handle

47
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,979
addition case and the multiplication

48
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,720
gates addition case are typically free

49
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,420
recurring no communication

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,070
therefore the communication callosity

51
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,690
depends upon the number of

52
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,690
multiplication case in the circuit

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,690
so it leads us to the following question

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,000
is it possible to construct and

55
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,370
condition NPC with guaranteed auto

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,950
delivery for once a corruption search

57
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,019
sets the communication come dust EEPROM

58
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,410
multiplication gates is linear in the

59
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:42,200
number of parties having linear

60
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,670
communication can dusty miss sets the

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,640
work done by a single party is

62
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,559
independent of the number of parties

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,869
participating in the commutation and as

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,709
a result the circuit sorry the protocol

65
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:59,420
is fully scalable previously personal

66
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,319
result in this day team was provided by

67
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,359
souvenir 1 Hertz in 2008 so entire

68
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,119
construction they provided their

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,830
protocol is the protocol has

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,170
communication Kansas tea order of

71
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,890
Southampton plus T M times N squared

72
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,899
plus n cube here sees the side of the

73
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:22,488
circuit and TM is the depth of the

74
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:25,790
circuit so we note that when the circuit

75
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:28,459
is narrow and a deep T M times n square

76
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,530
becomes the dominating term and at the

77
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,060
communication contrasty promoter periods

78
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,890
can be as high as order of n square

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,340
unfortunately this term t M times n

80
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,250
square appears in many previous works it

81
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,620
led pin sentence fair and Ostrovsky to

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,870
ask whether this term is inherent in

83
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,519
their work in 2012 so in this work we

84
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,350
give the first construction where the

85
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,620
communication comes st from what hearing

86
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,120
gates is linear in the number of parties

87
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,889
concretely our protocol has

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,980
communication con does the order of say

89
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,230
times n plus and Q so this represent

90
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:13,100
strict improvements over the previously

91
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:15,679
personal result for convenience we use

92
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,200
square bracket a with the subscript T to

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,600
represent a D plus 1 out of inertia

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,200
musical sharing referred as deserving

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,720
letter shares be a 1 a 2 2 a n

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,628
especially the as pad C as party a P I

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,030
host a share a I

98
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:38,000
it is not well knowing that when T is

99
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,068
smaller than my Sri a teacher in can

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,250
always be reconstructed even if some

101
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:48,560
teachers are incorrect before

102
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,389
introducing our main techniques we would

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,819
like to mention two useful techniques

104
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,400
which are very used to construct the

105
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:59,330
efficient NPC with ulterior guarantee in

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,729
the anklet of 13 the first one is party

107
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,580
elimination framework it was first

108
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:09,620
introduced in the in the work of hurt

109
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,508
more predatory dated hack in 2000 so it

110
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,629
is a general strategy to efficiently

111
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,819
achieve perfect security the first step

112
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,729
is partitioning the whole circuit into

113
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:24,050
several segments all these segments will

114
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:27,110
be will be evaluated in sequence after

115
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,180
evaluating one segment all parties reach

116
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,180
a consensus on whether the evaluation

117
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,520
successful or not say if it is

118
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,050
successful the null parties can continue

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,090
to evaluate the next segment otherwise a

120
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,629
pair of parties who do not agree with

121
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,210
each other

122
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:47,000
referred as disputed parties is

123
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,440
identified disputed parties will not

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,169
participate in the rest of the

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,759
commutation and the same segment will be

126
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:57,589
reevaluated so in this way we only need

127
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,750
to focus on how to find a pair of

128
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,750
disability parties the failure occurs

129
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,460
the second technique spirit ripple it

130
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,839
was first introduced in the work of

131
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:16,279
beaver in 1981 a pure triple consists of

132
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:18,349
three teacher wins a B and C here a PR

133
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,710
to Redmond field elements and the C

134
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:24,710
equals to a times B to compute a

135
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,799
modification gates with input servants x

136
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,638
and y our parties need to reconstruct to

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,379
t sharings

138
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,080
x + a and what s B then the author

139
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,370
Sharon C can be represented by using two

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,520
values X plus a

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,630
whereas B and straight assurance a B and

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,688
C note that these techniques transform

143
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,819
one multiplication

144
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:55,259
operation into to reconstruction

145
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:57,419
operations now let's have a quick review

146
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,739
of the construction of tribunal wanna

147
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,409
hurt after preparing enough below

148
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:06,568
proposed during the preparation phase

149
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:10,919
the main task is to reconstruct several

150
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:13,319
t-shirts for multiplication gates until

151
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,808
work they provided a protocol to

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,199
reconstruct a batch of t-shirts at one

153
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:22,259
time the overall cost per batch is order

154
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,829
of n square and as a result the average

155
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,349
costs per gate is just order of n

156
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:31,649
however only multiplication case in one

157
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,899
layer can be handled each time since

158
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,759
each layer requires at least order of n

159
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,279
square communication theories an

160
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,839
overhead order of DM times n square in

161
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:45,959
their construction to overcome this

162
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,959
barrier our starting idea is lighting is

163
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,619
let is letting one party to our

164
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,050
reconstruction a special party PQ is

165
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:57,979
elected in the beginning then to

166
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,659
reconstruct the Tshering say x plus a

167
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:03,179
picking simply collects all shares from

168
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:05,759
the rest of the parties reconstruct the

169
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:09,989
results and sends the results back to

170
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,599
them in this way the cost per gate is

171
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:17,698
just all open even if only one gate is

172
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:20,188
evaluated however if PQ is corrupted

173
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,469
then kihyun made disrepute and gain

174
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:26,789
crack value or even sent the different

175
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:28,829
values to different parties it means

176
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:33,750
that we need to check the correctness of

177
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:35,669
the reconstructions were still we funded

178
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,279
this check is actually required every

179
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,438
layer without check not only the

180
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,750
correctness cannot be guaranteed but

181
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:44,550
also a malicious peeking can learn the

182
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,180
full value of an internal wear of the

183
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,639
circuit we give an explicit attack in

184
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,319
our work for this simple two level

185
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,449
circuits which confuse x times y times w

186
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,920
the main security issue is that a

187
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:01,680
teacher has to

188
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,229
redundancy picking onion is cheap that's

189
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,790
why shears to reconstruct a tea sharing

190
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:11,399
and even recall Irish years of this ruin

191
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,889
the hallo idea of our attack is lacking

192
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,040
a militia speaking sent an incorrect

193
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:19,529
value to one on his party since this

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,839
party uses an incorrect value further

195
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,300
shares provided by this party are also

196
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,839
incorrect

197
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:30,180
however Pekin kind use all shares except

198
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,760
the share from this party to reconstruct

199
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,519
the tea sharing and the computer correct

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,380
shared at this party should hold by

201
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,870
comparing the correct value and the

202
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,519
incorrect value of this party peeking

203
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,519
can actually gain extra information

204
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:51,209
note that each check is a consensus that

205
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,630
is all parties should agree on whether

206
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,339
the evaluation is successful or not it

207
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,209
is knowing that regional consensus

208
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:02,190
requests at least unsquare communication

209
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:09,420
therefore we still have this DM times N

210
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:11,850
squared over hat in our construction to

211
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,010
avoid its check error layer - hello

212
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,500
because the hell of an idea of our

213
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:21,060
construction is using an auto-injector

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,750
sharing in this way we can remove the

215
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,170
redundancy of t-shirts and always attack

216
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,380
mentioned above however without

217
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,560
redundancy cheating becomes easier and

218
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,750
the funding educator becomes harder we

219
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,979
need to increase the redundancy to find

220
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:43,829
the jitter to this and would rely on for

221
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,230
consistency a new technique to increase

222
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:50,609
the redundancy of an automatic sharing

223
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,740
and demand because that a teacher in can

224
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,470
always be reconstructed even if some

225
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:00,300
teachers are incorrect in other words

226
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:03,000
t-shirts have enough redundancy the

227
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,310
basic idea of focus distance II is using

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,449
additional strength assurance to commit

229
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,189
the shares of an ottoman state sharing

230
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:12,270
so we first partition all shares into

231
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,120
three parts

232
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,579
and since we expand each parts 2p

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,340
evaluatee sharing in this way

234
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,360
IRA sure can be recovered we will

235
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,360
include more details later

236
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,440
so first of all when we use an utterance

237
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,280
experience referred as ensuring to

238
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,990
always a check area layer we include two

239
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,089
additional insurance in a bureau triple

240
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,660
insuring of the value a and an initial

241
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,550
of the value P when evaluating one

242
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,339
modification gates instead of

243
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,849
reconstructing two T sharings X plus a

244
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:57,060
and y plus P all parties reconstruct two

245
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,850
insurance the teacher in ax plus the

246
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:04,469
initial a and the teacher in Y plus the

247
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,480
insuring P note that the shears sent by

248
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,460
honest parties are just the several

249
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,580
independent and uniformly random

250
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,820
elements therefore all parties can

251
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,440
securely evaluate multiple layers of

252
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,890
multiplication case even if picking is

253
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,890
corrupted

254
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,410
as before further check is still

255
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,329
necessary we first check whether peak

256
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,709
instance the same values to our other

257
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:37,470
parties if this check passes then all

258
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:42,750
the other series of multiplication case

259
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,370
are valid at each series then we need to

260
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,000
check the correctness of our

261
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:50,550
constructions to do this I'll put opera

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,950
simply recompute our constructions by

263
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,490
using tissue rules X plus a and a where

264
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:59,610
plus B we can simply use the protocol in

265
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,130
the work of true Renea wanna hurt note

266
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,290
that the difference is that we have

267
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:08,279
already computed a very the tissue rule

268
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,219
for each where it means that we can do

269
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,320
our reconstructions in parallel and the

270
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:22,500
layer restriction in the work of cubanía

271
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:25,560
wanna hurt disappears so if the check

272
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,600
fails then all parties automatically

273
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,270
reach a consensus on the first incorrect

274
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,330
reconstruction say it is accessed r plus

275
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:37,770
a a star there are two possibilities a

276
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,650
malicious speaking may distribute an

277
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:43,050
incredible you or some crowded party

278
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,939
mason an inquest sheer when picking

279
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:51,300
reconstruct hit the teacher in access

280
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:54,570
star plus the angel star since it is

281
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,849
still sharing any party concerned around

282
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,730
share without being caught in other

283
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:03,980
words the redundancy of an automatic

284
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,980
serum is not enough to find a cheater

285
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,490
therefore we need to go back to see how

286
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,290
this inaudible six servings are

287
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:16,200
generated we use square bracket a a star

288
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,339
with subscript G and n to represent two

289
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,040
two sherries

290
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,839
of the same value a star when is the T

291
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,569
sharing and the other one is and

292
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,709
ensuring we refer this to Sherry's as

293
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,310
double sharon's in the beginning each

294
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:35,339
party I generates and disreputable

295
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,810
Sherry's of a random element as I let

296
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,810
MBO happen invertible

297
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,569
tricks then the double Sheeran's of a 1

298
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:46,949
a 2 2 a n can be computed by multiplying

299
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,940
em and the double series of of the

300
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,760
double generated by each party

301
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,220
especially the double shares of a star

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,980
can be computed by multiplying the I

303
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:05,400
stars row of M and the vector of double

304
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:07,770
Sharon's generated by each party record

305
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,930
that at each area can always be

306
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,079
reconstructed even if some t-shirts are

307
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,520
incorrect

308
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,529
therefore t-shirts has high enough

309
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,760
redundancy we only need to focus on

310
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:23,939
insurance our goal is to be able to read

311
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:28,589
how Irish share of and share and sharing

312
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:31,830
as i4ii we observed that a teacher has

313
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:35,700
enough redundancy and a tissue is

314
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:38,820
determined by Chi plus one shares by

315
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,180
listing all shares as the matrix each

316
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,050
low is a valid ensuring and each party

317
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,699
holds shares in one column when we

318
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,939
partition this matrix into three parts

319
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,940
such that each part contains at most T

320
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,660
plus 1 columns to increase the

321
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,730
redundancy say for the rest of metrics

322
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:02,910
we can expand each row to be a valid T

323
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,130
sharing this new matrix can be seen as

324
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,860
the robust version of the rest of matrix

325
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:11,360
and Irish sure can be recovered no

326
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,360
matter how crowded parties behave

327
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,850
similarly we may generate through other

328
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,800
matrices as the robust versions of the

329
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,900
yellow stop matrix and the green star

330
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,609
matrix with these three matrices Irish

331
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,050
share of the original matrix can be

332
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:37,260
recovered let the last matrix be out

333
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:41,880
assurance as one as to 2004 area we call

334
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:45,120
this faulty series as a 0 as i1 i2 and

335
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,020
acessory all focuses for consistent

purple of cheering's

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,579
is for consistent with respect to a

339
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,820
partition of all parties where the size

340
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:06,390
of each site is at most he passed one if

341
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:09,180
it satisfies that the shears of s1 held

342
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,060
by parties in p1 the shares of as to

343
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,480
held by parties in p2 and the shears of

344
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:22,740
s3 held a partisan history from a valid

345
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:25,170
insuring of the value as 0 we notice

346
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,830
that for consistency is preserved under

347
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,510
linear regions each party I generous and

348
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,840
the disrepute three additional t

349
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,750
sharings III one aside to and as a three

350
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,470
such that together with the teacher in

351
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,840
SI this forty servings is so for

352
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,200
consistent apple and the corresponding

353
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,990
insuring is the ensure as i in this way

354
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,900
each party uses a four consistent apple

355
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:56,820
to commit the shears of the insuring is

356
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,430
generated since for consistency is

357
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,500
preserved under linear visions we can

358
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,860
compute a for consistent apple of a a

359
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:12,960
star as the commitment of the ensuring a

360
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:16,919
a star finally all parties locally

361
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,890
computer assurance access star plus a

362
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,860
estar one access start as a star to and

363
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:26,670
access table has a start tree then the

364
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,800
senator shares to peking note that this

365
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,110
treaty showings can be seen as the

366
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,960
robust version of the tissue in access

367
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:40,290
star plus the engineer star with this

368
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,030
reassurance peeking is able to recall

369
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,420
every share of the teacher being

370
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:48,860
accessed our plaza initial a star and

371
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,860
fund the party who send around here

372
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,970
as a summary we first use an automatic

373
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,750
assurance to eval so securely evaluate

374
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,920
multiple layers of multiplication kids

375
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,520
so then we need to check the correctness

376
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,060
of reconstructions in the case that some

377
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,370
reconstruction is incorrect we use for

378
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,480
consistency to increase the redundancy

379
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,310
of an automatic sharing and finally we

380
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:36,760
can find a cheater also relying on for

381
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:38,409
consistency thank you questions ok we

382
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,990
have no questions let's thank all

383
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,470
speakers of the session

384
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,470
[Applause]
