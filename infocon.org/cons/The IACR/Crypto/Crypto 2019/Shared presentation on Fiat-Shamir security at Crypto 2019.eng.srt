1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,879
right so in this talk we are going to

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,889
analyze the quantum security of Fiat

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:16,379
Xiaomi our non interactive zero

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,160
knowledge proof and fear charm your

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,900
signatures these objects are actually

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,710
constructed in two steps which we will

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,830
eat separately analyzed namely you have

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,300
the field Shamir transformation which we

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,339
apply to a sigma protocol i will in the

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,629
first part of this talk talk about the

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,150
security of the field Shimer

12
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:41,460
transformation where i can already give

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,159
away that the main issue here is how to

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,140
do with superposition access to the

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,710
random Oracle about which we have seen

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,619
two talks already and then in the second

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,479
part jipang will talk about how to prove

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,140
quantum security for the underlying

19
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,570
sigma protocols this separation was also

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,239
allows me to give a quick comparison

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:08,760
between the two papers in the first part

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,619
we both have a reduction the only

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,800
difference lies in the tightness of the

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,650
reduction and interestingly also in the

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,050
methods that we used and in the second

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,660
part both of our papers formulated a new

27
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,120
property and we demonstrated that this

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,399
property is sufficient for quantum

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,710
security but on top of that beyond

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,800
xandrie also develop some extra

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,050
technical tools that allow to prove that

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,830
certain schemes actually satisfy this

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:42,030
property right so first about the field

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,039
Sharma transform in a nutshell it takes

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,530
away the interaction from a sigma

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,840
protocol so given a sigma protocol which

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,840
is an interactive scheme we apply the

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,820
transform to obtain these non

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,260
interactive objects that I mentioned

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:01,859
before and of this transformation it has

41
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,159
long been known that classically it is

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,908
secure in the random Oracle model in the

43
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,408
sense that any security notion ranging

44
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:12,989
from computational soundness to

45
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:15,929
statistical proof of knowledge name your

46
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,090
favorite one if the Sigma protocol

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,630
satisfies this property then we can

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,250
prove that

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,560
the non-interactive fear charm your

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:29,070
transformed version does so as well well

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,940
up to recently the quantum setting

52
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:37,160
looked quite different we had only one

53
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,920
we are only one positive result here

54
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,440
namely by Dominic oon row in 2017 but

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,510
this security proof applied only to the

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,750
case where the underlying Sigma protocol

57
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,350
is statistically sound so only one of

58
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,790
the possible properties and actually one

59
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,680
that is not typically found in

60
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,150
cryptographic applications for the other

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,820
properties the computational ones for

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,050
example it was unknown whether they are

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,880
carried over proof of knowledge which

64
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,010
happens to be the one that is crucial

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,040
when you want to prove unfortunate efore

66
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,310
fear charm your signatures also unknown

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,440
and to make matters worse there were

68
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,690
even some negative claims as to the

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,380
possibility for a security proof

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,780
regarding these properties however the

71
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,840
main result of both of our papers is

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,030
that indeed also in the quantum setting

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,430
the field Charmy transformation is

74
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,150
secure now in the quantum random Oracle

75
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,850
model exactly as in the classical case

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,910
any security notion that you can think

77
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:48,299
of is inherited with the only difference

78
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,049
being that we now get a Q squared

79
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,870
security loss or if an acute to the 9 in

80
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,280
the paper by Leo and sundry compared to

81
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,150
the linear loss that we have in the

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,180
classical case nevertheless this result

83
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,950
allows us to conclude that if the

84
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,010
underlying Sigma protocol is quantum

85
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,640
secure then we have unfortunately our

86
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,670
signatures the condition in itself is

87
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,358
already non-trivial jipang will have

88
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,329
more to say about that in second parts

89
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,789
right so I will first tell you a bit

90
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,010
more about technical details of our

91
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,900
results for which I will have to explain

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,509
a bit about Sigma protocols and how the

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,270
field Sharma transformation works also

94
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:36,330
saying it's about how to extend this

95
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,770
paradigm to obtain signature schemes

96
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,020
then I'll give you an intuition for the

97
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,889
classical proof and the quantum issues

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,109
that we find in the Cure ROM and finally

99
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:51,039
the technical results that we have to

100
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:54,639
overcome these issues okay so a Sigma

101
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,650
protocol is an interactive proof of a

102
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,300
special form that does not reveal

103
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,818
anything beyond the truth of the

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,229
statement this letter property as you

105
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,759
probably know is what we call zero

106
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:08,229
knowledge the famous example being where

107
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,300
somebody wants to prove that two graphs

108
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:16,779
are isomorphic without revealing the

109
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:19,180
isomorphism well a Sigma protocol is a

110
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:23,229
particular kind of ceará knowledge proof

111
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,229
namely one that works as follows if some

112
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:28,960
proofer wants to prove the truth of a

113
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,589
statement X using its knowledge about a

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,169
witness W he can do so by computing

115
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:37,779
something we call the commitment which

116
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,049
it sends on to the verifier who then

117
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,789
replies with a uniformly random

118
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,699
challenge it always has to be uniformly

119
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:48,279
random which the proof read and in turn

120
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,740
can use to compute a response which he

121
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,169
sends over to the verifier and if this

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,879
response satisfies certain relation with

123
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,948
respect to this commitment and this

124
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:01,870
challenge then the verifier accepts

125
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:06,249
technical detail that I should mention

126
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:08,770
by p1 and p2 I of course mean two faces

127
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,959
of the same algorithm so implicitly they

128
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,729
are allowed to share state which is

129
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,689
something that will become important in

130
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:21,699
chippings part of the talk but for us

131
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:25,379
this this suffices now the field shall

132
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,870
transform as promised it takes away the

133
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,669
interaction by replacing the challenge

134
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,949
from the verifier in the second round

135
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:39,399
with the hash of X and the commitment

136
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:42,550
which the proofer can compute by himself

137
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:45,130
using some publicly known hash function

138
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,100
of which you can find the code on

139
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,409
or whatever the main point is that it

140
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,610
has to be one in the same hash function

141
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:58,260
that is known to all parties which they

142
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:02,080
then again uses to compute a response

143
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,730
and now the proofer sends over the

144
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
commitment and the response in one

145
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,440
single step so these two objects

146
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,340
together now make up the non interactive

147
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,670
proof and to verify it the verifier as

148
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,789
to do one extra thing namely recompute

149
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:21,610
the challenge himself which he does by

150
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,260
looking up the same hash function and

151
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,210
again checks if the proper relation

152
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,940
holds right so to get signatures very

153
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,770
simple extension of this idea namely

154
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,370
includes a message that you want to sign

155
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,099
in the hash and to make the picture

156
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,650
complete we have then a public key and a

157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,100
secret key consisting of some X and some

158
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:50,500
W from a heart relation so W must be

159
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:52,660
hard to obtain from just X right the

160
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,300
challenge is now defined as the hash of

161
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,310
the message you want to sign X and the

162
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,200
commitment and the signature simply

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,680
consists of this non interactive proof

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,990
that we have as a small motivational

165
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,570
note I'd like to point out that we have

166
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,490
currently three signature schemes in the

167
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,590
second round of the nice post quantum

168
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:16,150
standardization project that actually

169
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:19,229
make use of this framework okay now we

170
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,270
get to the proof in the classical case

171
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:25,000
what do we want to do we want to reduce

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,400
the security of the non-interactive

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,120
scheme to the security of the underlying

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,059
Sigma protocol how do we do that by

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,960
assuming that we actually have some

176
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,089
adversary who making Q a polynomial

177
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,000
amount of queries to the random Oracle

178
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,690
is able to break the non interactive

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,020
feature scheme then we are going to play

180
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,240
the Sigma protocol not using the Una's

181
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,270
proofer but using some reduction

182
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,880
algorithm who is going to use black box

183
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,939
access to this adversary in order to

184
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,520
break the security

185
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,960
of the Sigma protocol and they are

186
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,280
breaking the security

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,960
it can mean anything it can mean that

188
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,110
the reduction can convince the verifier

189
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,150
without knowing a witness it can mean

190
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,890
that you can convince the verifier on

191
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,220
some statements X that is not in a

192
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,140
language it really doesn't matter any

193
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,530
trick that the non-interactive adversary

194
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:28,040
can do we will show that the reduction

195
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,500
can do as well in the Sigma protocol so

196
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,530
how does that work well using its black

197
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,290
box access to the adversary the

198
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,819
reduction is going to run a while

199
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,089
implementing the random Oracle himself

200
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,160
which just means that he is going to

201
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,310
execute the adversary and during every

202
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,819
one of these Q queries reply with some

203
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:56,170
arbitrary random challenge up until a

204
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,690
certain point where a randomly chosen

205
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:03,770
query where the reduction says okay hey

206
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:06,380
now I'm going to carefully look at what

207
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,500
the adversary is querying it will be

208
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,140
some X and some commitment and then this

209
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,860
commitment I am going to pass on to the

210
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,910
verifier that I want to fool then of

211
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,910
course the reduction will will get a

212
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,329
random challenge from the verifier which

213
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,969
it now then will pass on to to the

214
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,670
adversary again so technically we say

215
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,640
that the reduction is going to reprogram

216
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,939
the random Oracle on this particular

217
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,839
input to the particular challenge that

218
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:44,270
he obtained from the verifier then it

219
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,240
has to do is just simply continue the

220
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,079
run of the adversary now answering every

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,240
query with the new reprogrammed Oracle

222
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,450
and just wait until it finishes its

223
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,560
computation pops out some non

224
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,920
interactive proof come Prime and some

225
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,109
response and then it takes this response

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:11,810
and presents it to the verifier who will

227
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,710
accept if this commitment in the final

228
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,689
output happens to

229
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,870
be the same that the reduction found

230
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,720
halfway when looking at this random

231
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,540
query because by assumption the

232
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,120
adversary can produce a valid non

233
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,240
interactive proof on some commitment and

234
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,300
if it's the same then the verifier will

235
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,120
accept which obviously will happen with

236
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,550
probability 1 over Q so hence the the

237
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:44,630
linear loss in this reduction right in

238
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,750
the quantum setting however we require a

239
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:51,170
proof in the quantum random Oracle model

240
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:54,380
where H is still a classical uniformly

241
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,439
random function but now we allow the

242
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:02,060
adversary superposition query access to

243
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,950
8 and I want to emphasize also maybe for

244
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:09,979
the people that just did a switch break

245
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:11,480
the track switch I mean that that it's

246
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,910
really important in post quantum

247
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,740
applications to look not just at the

248
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,890
underlying hardness assumption which of

249
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,650
course has to be both quantum secure but

250
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,620
also we have to consider an adversary

251
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,020
that makes these superposition queries

252
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,380
and the motivation for this model comes

253
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:34,189
from the fact that as I explained H is

254
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,020
this publicly known as function of which

255
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,380
the code the code of which you can just

256
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,420
look up in some place which means that

257
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,150
in real life the adversary is not

258
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,160
interacting with some magical Oracle it

259
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,670
actually has a circuit on its quantum

260
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,040
computer to evaluate the hash function

261
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,680
which means that he can also evaluate

262
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,099
this function on a superposition of

263
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,790
inputs okay but what does that do to our

264
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:06,560
picture in the reduction if we now want

265
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:08,060
to reduce the quantum security we again

266
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,670
assume that we have an adversary that

267
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,520
breaks the non-interactive scheme this

268
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,360
time making Q quantum carries to eight

269
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,380
and suppose we want to try what we did

270
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,500
before have this reduction run the

271
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,649
adversary and try to read off one of its

272
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,509
queries well then we run into

273
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,930
what mark just called the observer

274
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:34,720
effect trying to look at a quantum query

275
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:38,920
can potentially destroy or at least

276
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,259
disturb at that disturb the query state

277
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,199
but will it also disturb the internal

278
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:51,819
states of the adversary right so if we

279
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:55,689
if we were to do such a measurement then

280
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:58,329
we can no longer in general predict what

281
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:00,069
the adversary is going to output because

282
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:03,638
its internal state might have been

283
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:05,410
disturbed too much now the contribution

284
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,619
of our papers is that we have a

285
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,649
technical result which in full

286
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:14,199
generality says that for any cue query

287
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:19,149
quantum algorithm which produces some

288
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:22,569
pair x and z where x and z satisfies

289
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:25,179
some particular relation i'm sorry i

290
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:28,360
said particularly i meant just any any

291
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:33,069
arbitrary relation with respect to the

292
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,959
hash of x then if we measure one of the

293
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:38,349
queries at random just like in the

294
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,388
classical case small caveat in Leon's

295
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,639
and risk analysis you should either

296
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:46,720
measure 1 or 3 but that's just an

297
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:50,019
artifact of the proof if we do some

298
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,170
measurement find an input to the Oracle

299
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:56,499
X and then reprogram again as in the

300
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,209
classical case reprogram or Oracle at

301
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:05,529
this input to some fresh arbitrary but

302
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:08,709
uniformly random value theta then we can

303
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:12,850
still continue the run of that adversary

304
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:18,878
and at the end find some output X prime

305
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:21,329
C where X prime actually equals the X

306
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,629
that we found in a measurement and

307
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:29,469
furthermore this relationship that did

308
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:33,249
this X Prime and C now satisfy satisfy a

309
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:36,670
relation with respect to the newly

310
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:37,990
programmed random value theta well

311
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,540
that's

312
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,100
just a little bit more abstractly the

313
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,740
thing exactly the thing that we need

314
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,130
here namely we wanted to measure one of

315
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:52,390
the queries of the adversary find some X

316
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:55,029
and commitment and continue to run and

317
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,630
hope that we find some non interactive

318
00:15:55,029 --> 00:16:00,220
proof where the commitment come prime

319
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,630
actually equals the one that we found

320
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,820
out way in the measurement so yeah

321
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,910
applying the results to this situation

322
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:13,120
we find that the response in the final

323
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:19,029
output still does a good job now with

324
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:23,860
probability 1 over Q squared ok

325
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:26,800
so interesting to note is that both of

326
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,330
our papers obtained a very similar

327
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,310
result using quite different methods in

328
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:38,080
our paper we used only elementary

329
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:40,089
techniques a very basic quantum very

330
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,630
basic want of formalism and some simple

331
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,570
medical tools and we obtained this Q

332
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:51,339
squared security large loss which we

333
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,950
believe is optimal and the other paper

334
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,350
by leo and sundry used the compressed

335
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,170
orco framework which mark just talked

336
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:03,040
about which is a more general and strong

337
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,678
tool but in this particular example it

338
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:13,420
had a less tight it made for a less

339
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:15,760
tight reduction right so to recap the

340
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,490
take-home message from the first part of

341
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,400
this talk is that we now have managed to

342
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,609
reduce even in the quantum setting any

343
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,069
any security notion that you can think

344
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:30,090
of from the non interactive a charm your

345
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,070
scheme to the underlying Sigma protocol

346
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,370
which poses the natural follow-up

347
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,950
question how can we prove a sigma

348
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,239
protocol quantum secure which is what

349
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,240
chip Bank is going to talk about

350
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:51,399
okay okay thanks ele for the first part

351
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:55,239
and I'm going to talk about the second

352
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:57,668
part which is about quantum rewinding so

353
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,769
quantum rewinding is a technique which

354
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:03,240
allows you to prove special sundnes

355
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:06,909
implies soundness or in other words it's

356
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,200
help you to prove certain Sigma protocol

357
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:13,330
is a proof of knowledge so first we give

358
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,330
a definition called collapsing which is

359
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,610
a property for a sigma protocol as well

360
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,408
as the Sigma protocol is collapsing we

361
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,360
can do quantum rewinding in other words

362
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:25,179
it is a proof of knowledge or an

363
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,820
argument of knowledge now also we gave

364
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:30,899
to classical sufficient conditions which

365
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:36,039
implies a sigma protocol is collapsing

366
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:39,699
and also we prove this is collapsing

367
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:42,370
which means the Lu bishops key signature

368
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,159
is post quantum and it's even holds for

369
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,199
polynomial Q which means we don't we

370
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,720
don't need a large program parameter we

371
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,220
just need to make the parameter slightly

372
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,429
bigger okay so let me talk about that

373
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,440
our definition of soundness so for a

374
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:03,039
sigma protocol it's always easy to

375
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,750
generate a a pair of transcript with

376
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,509
commitment challenge and response

377
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,110
because it usually satisfy owners verify

378
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:13,779
of zero knowledge so first son is here

379
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:17,639
we actually mean there's no algorithm

380
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:20,620
without the witness can produce a valid

381
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:23,379
response after the commitment is made

382
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:28,059
and the random challenge is also

383
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:30,699
selected after the commitment and for

384
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,460
specialist honest which means there's no

385
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,970
algorithm can come out with two valid

386
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,350
pairs which like under the same

387
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:45,039
commitment but different challenges okay

388
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,490
so here's what we do for classical

389
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,340
rewinding assume we have algorithm for

390
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,640
like which breaks soundness the

391
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,429
algorithm has two parts for p1 its perdu

392
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,950
commitment for p2 is actually an

393
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,610
algorithm for getting a valley response

394
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,070
so after outputting the commitment

395
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:10,000
let's assume the internal state of the

396
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,129
algorithm is as team and give a

397
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,530
challenge it

398
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,990
it runs the algorithm p2 over the

399
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,110
statement acts the commitment and the

400
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,390
random challenge and it let's assume

401
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,080
with a hundred percent probability it

402
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,850
actually produces a value response

403
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:32,320
so that's algorithm for our breaking

404
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:36,040
Sunnis so if two random challenges are

405
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,939
given we simply copy this state as T and

406
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:44,230
we run p2 twice that is we run p2 over

407
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:47,650
the challenge CH and then and we get a

408
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,280
valid response for CH and then we rewind

409
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:54,430
by just restore s T and we run p2 over

410
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,160
the other random challenges each H Prime

411
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:59,830
in which sense we can get a two pair of

412
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,560
valid transcript under the same

413
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:05,970
commitment which breaks special saunas

414
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,760
this is how we do classical rewinding

415
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,320
but however for a quantum algorithm this

416
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,110
stage is actually a quantum

417
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,450
superposition so we cannot follow this

418
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,949
cloning technique because we know it's

419
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:23,830
hard to clone quantum superposition so

420
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,350
inspired from loose word the claps

421
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,080
fighting commitment scheme we show that

422
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,020
collapsing is the definition collapsing

423
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,850
is enough for quantum rewinding and also

424
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,330
we give to classical sufficient

425
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,820
contentions so I will introduce the

426
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:43,230
definition collapsing Sigma protocol and

427
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,610
I will mailing focus on the first

428
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:50,650
classical sufficient condition which is

429
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,870
called lousy function okay so here is

430
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:56,380
the definition of collapsing Sigma

431
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,870
protocol so there's no adversary' a can

432
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,020
succeed the following game with more

433
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:06,399
than half probability so here is the

434
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,840
game we have algorithm a which outputs a

435
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
commitment first

436
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,939
gets a random challenge from the

437
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:18,700
verifier then a propels a superposition

438
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,250
over or valid response that I mean for

439
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:25,000
valid means is valid respect to the

440
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:28,570
commitment and the challenge and sends

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,549
the superposition to the verifier then

442
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,970
the verifier flips are calling if the

443
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,700
coin is 1 it measures the superposition

444
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,549
otherwise it does nothing then a

445
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,399
succeeds if and only if the adversary'

446
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:45,580
can get the coin in other words the game

447
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:49,658
means like claps in Sigma protocol means

448
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:52,590
there's no adversary can guess if the

449
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:57,159
superposition is measured or not

450
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:59,949
so with collapsing Sigma protocol we can

451
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,990
actually do quantum rewinding here's how

452
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:06,610
we do that so assuming we have a phone

453
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:10,350
on anniversary a also with two stages p1

454
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:13,570
p2 assume it breaks honest after

455
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,668
outputting the commitment let's assume

456
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:21,549
the algorithm has its own internal state

457
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:24,070
which is a superposition SG so given the

458
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:26,710
first challenge it just simply runs the

459
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,020
algorithm over the same and adds the

460
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,059
commitment and also the challenge so

461
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,908
first implicitly let's just assume it's

462
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:37,629
a unitary the algorithm just select a

463
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:40,870
unitary based on XCOM nch and applies

464
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:45,820
the unitary over the internal state st

465
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:47,979
and and we just make it even simple we

466
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,760
just assume after that we got a

467
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,559
superposition over or valid response

468
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,470
then the next thing to do is just

469
00:23:53,559 --> 00:24:03,789
measure the superposition and we get a

470
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:06,490
valid response and because we know the

471
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,429
Sigma protocol is collapsing which means

472
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:12,190
a have no way to tell if the

473
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:14,049
superposition is measured or not in

474
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,860
other words a measure of superposition

475
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:21,370
is basically indistinguishable from the

476
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,070
original superposition so we can easily

477
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,709
back get back to the original internal

478
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:30,879
state just by applying the inverse of

479
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:33,430
the unitary to the state and because of

480
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,620
the indistinguishability of collapsing

481
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:41,710
we can just go back to the internal

482
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:44,080
state s GE and by given another

483
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,450
challenge CH Prime we can just do the

484
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,820
same because we have already get back to

485
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,400
the internal state s G we can apply the

486
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,950
unitary again but under a different

487
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,540
challenge and by assumption that's a

488
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,300
superposition over all valid response

489
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,790
prime which is valid under commitment

490
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:07,149
and the new challenge so in which case

491
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,850
it produces two value pairs under the

492
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,850
same commitment which breaks special

493
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:20,080
saunas this is how we do on quantum

494
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:22,179
rewinding okay so this is one of the

495
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,760
classical sufficient condition for

496
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:28,110
having collapsing Sigma protocol which

497
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:33,370
is called lousy function is also a

498
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:35,800
generalization of Buddhist work so the

499
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,770
basic idea is very simple let's assume

500
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,960
there are collection of functions which

501
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,990
is defined over or valid response

502
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,050
respect to a fixed commitment and

503
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,210
challenge so for the injective mode the

504
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:55,210
function is the injective function over

505
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,330
the domain and for constant mode it's

506
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,060
just constant function and also there's

507
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,659
no post quantum adversary' can

508
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,990
distinguish which function is picked in

509
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:10,260
other words like it cannot tell if it's

510
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:15,220
a function for an injective mode or

511
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,230
constant mode and this is some intuition

512
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,020
about why lossy function implies

513
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,790
collapsing so assume we have a

514
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:28,389
superposition of over valid response

515
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:30,190
which is not measured it's exactly the

516
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,920
same as we apply a constant function

517
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,570
over the response and we measure the

518
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,580
function register

519
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,009
cause the second register is constant

520
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:42,240
nature that does not affect our first

521
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:46,149
register so they're exactly the same and

522
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,429
from lousy function we know that they're

523
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:50,799
indistinguishable so we can apply the

524
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:54,279
injective mode instead of the constant

525
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,889
mode and finally because the function is

526
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,799
injective measure the second register is

527
00:26:56,889 --> 00:27:04,059
exactly equal to measure the first

528
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:05,370
register so which we have the

529
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,168
superposition measure is

530
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:12,850
indistinguishable from the superposition

531
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:16,470
that is not measuring okay so here's how

532
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:19,840
we rewind the Sigma protocol quantumly

533
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,549
we can first we can either prove the

534
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,769
Sigma protocol is collapsing

535
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,740
just follow the definition which recall

536
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:29,590
some knowledge about quantum or we can

537
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,080
prove the Sigma protocol has comparable

538
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:37,990
lossy functions or separable functions

539
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:40,178
which is purely classical condition for

540
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:43,899
example we prove that a little bit chefs

541
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:48,039
key signature the valid response are

542
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,779
solutions we prove sis is collapsing by

543
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:55,450
showing there are lots of functions and

544
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:59,379
separable functions okay so in

545
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,350
conclusion we show that a sigma protocol

546
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:04,658
with special sound plus collapsing

547
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:09,129
property gives you proof of knowledge

548
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:12,129
and for honest verify their knowledge

549
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:14,830
proof of knowledge plus fill Shamir it

550
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,570
unconditionally gives you non

551
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,110
interactive there are knowledge proof of

552
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,970
knowledge and unforgeable signature and

553
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:28,199
as example we show the Reshevsky

554
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:28,200
signature is post quantum secure thanks

555
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,929
and we have time for a couple of

556
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:45,690
questions just a quick question

557
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:48,169
so it's part of the Novation you

558
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,960
mentioned picnic dilithium and in QD s s

559
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,910
mq d s s is yeah she Mir base but it's a

560
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,260
five-run identification scheme not a 3r

561
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,380
and like standard Sigma's that still

562
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,320
work there with not any kind of loss of

563
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,539
parameters or we are actually currently

564
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,270
working on extending the proof that we

565
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,490
have for Sigma protocol for the three

566
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,090
run schemes to multiple round schemes

567
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,130
okay

568
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,070
so there's there's more that's going on

569
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,809
that you have to kind of handle I guess

570
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,668
yeah yeah it takes yeah it's a

571
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,530
non-trivial extension but we suspect

572
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:23,280
that it should be possible okay great

573
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:25,049
thanks so you showed that a large class

574
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,330
of Sigma protocols that are collapsing

575
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:29,250
or quantumly sound is it known agar and

576
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,168
a sigma protocols that are not quantumly

577
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,799
sound that are like standard classical

578
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:37,080
sound sound and such examples I'm sorry

579
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,030
are there in examples of Sigma protocols

580
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,230
that that are not collapsing and are

581
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,230
also not talk to my sound

582
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:51,389
you mean like is there any example which

583
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:54,419
is like not collapsing but also not like

584
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:59,240
sounding content yes yes there is some

585
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,240
example show in previous work yeah yes

586
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:07,580
okay last call for questions all right

587
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,580
let's think yellow keeping all the

588
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,040
you
