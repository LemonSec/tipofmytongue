1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:13,549
whoo thank you so much for inviting me

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:17,150
here I'm this is the talk is going to be

3
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:22,490
about contextual integrity as you can

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,830
see and I'm so delighted to be here

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,919
because I'm absolutely convinced and

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,769
more and more convinced that the privacy

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,630
problem that we're all confronting today

8
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:37,100
is not going to be solved by one

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:40,070
discipline alone and the the only way we

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,960
will get a handle on it is if multiple

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,600
disciplines and even within those

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,890
disciplines multiple fields will come

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,289
together and engage and hopefully what I

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,170
strive to do in my own work is to create

15
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,539
some sort of bridging between the

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,199
philosophical and ethical discussion and

17
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:05,300
though to law on the one hand loan

18
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:09,229
regulation and also technology on the

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,619
other and I've had really the good luck

20
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,408
of working with some fantastic computer

21
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:18,380
scientists both on the theory side and

22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,689
on the more systems applied side and so

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,579
I really look forward to engagement I

24
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:25,600
should say I'm a philosopher you heard

25
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:32,649
I'm a philosopher in my PhD and

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:35,560
philosophers find it to be a failure if

27
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:39,170
you present something and nobody

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,899
disagrees with you so I'm going to try

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,899
and leave the hope is that I would leave

30
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,840
about 15 minutes at the end of the talk

31
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,969
so that we can engage in and you should

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,540
please feel free to ask questions and

33
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:59,649
debate what I'm saying I have just

34
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,640
arrived from oops how do I do that

35
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:03,640
it's not responding

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:17,190
we're oh I'm sorry I didn't switch it on

37
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:26,349
theory of contextual integrity and I

38
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:30,250
just came today actually last night from

39
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,828
a small symposium that now we have we've

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,019
had the second symposium on contextual

41
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:39,040
applications of contextual integrity

42
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:41,530
where I was really delighted to see that

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,890
people came from different disciplines

44
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,489
and brought different methods and we

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,980
were continuing a conversation about

46
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,409
that and pushing out some research and

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,078
in the talk I'll kind of wave her hand

48
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:58,090
to some of what we've been doing some of

49
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,190
which I'm involved in myself but a lot

50
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,970
of it I'm pleased to say it does not

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,639
involve me so what was my way into

52
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,760
privacy a lot of philosophers got into

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,540
privacy maybe in the 60s and so on

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,159
because we were we were this word had

55
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,108
been emerging and many people engaged in

56
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,819
this question of how do you define

57
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:27,489
privacy my entry was not that I was a

58
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,810
PhD student at Stanford and I was seeing

59
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,120
the emergence of many of these

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:36,489
technologies and of course this is

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,699
really updated to sort of today mine was

62
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,220
not that I was rather interested in the

63
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,349
technologies and some of the

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,629
applications of the technologies that

65
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:52,328
were affecting our lives in all walks of

66
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,810
life and particularly interested in

67
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,479
those occasions where people said oh my

68
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,120
God my privacy is violated whatever was

69
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,579
happening the freaked out that people

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,699
were having as a result of it they

71
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:09,220
labeled privacy so I wasn't so much

72
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,790
interested in a philosophical deep dive

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,859
as valuable as that is into the concept

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,380
which is what a lot of analytic

75
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:20,409
philosophers do and it is valuable to

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:25,360
gain clarity on terms but rather I was

77
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:29,260
trying to look at the family of episodes

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,479
or systems or occurrences to which

79
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,230
people responded with this particular

80
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,640
freak

81
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:39,130
and labeling its in this way so what

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,729
I've tried to do over the years is to

83
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,760
say how do we achieve meaningful privacy

84
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:50,260
that is to say defining a concept that's

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,950
true to that experience defining it in a

86
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,960
way that we could argue that whatever it

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,950
is that people were caring about when

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,599
they said that was worth defending

89
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,430
because sometimes people freaked out and

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,470
you say stop freaking out that is not

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,630
worth defending but it seemed to me

92
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,870
there was something there and so I

93
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,240
wanted an approach some definition of

94
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,820
whatever this thing was that was not

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,580
only clear and hopefully rigorous but

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,560
also could offer an account of why we

97
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,280
should care about it and why we can

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,010
advocate and protest and have a reason

99
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,409
to defend it and then some of the things

100
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,200
that followed was the ability to give it

101
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,300
formal expression so that it could they

102
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,180
could potentially be some kind of

103
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,760
implementation and enforcement was an

104
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,880
added bonus because then potentially we

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,770
might be able to embed or you know

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,310
follow what later has been called

107
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,049
privacy by design and I want to just

108
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,560
take a moment to acknowledge and they're

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,290
probably even more names but many of the

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,990
people who I have worked with over the

111
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,330
years because when I mentioned earlier

112
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,580
that I didn't think one discipline is

113
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,849
the crown jewels and can and couldn't

114
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,130
solve this problem by itself there many

115
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,860
people and these folks come from all

116
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,630
walks of life and potentially you

117
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,150
recognize some of them so the way I want

118
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,740
to introduce contextual integrity to you

119
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,870
is to highlight four key ideas because

120
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,900
you know I like to think it's a big and

121
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,250
complicated theory there's a book you

122
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,409
know if you want to delve into the

123
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,200
details by now they're a bunch of

124
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,480
articles where I realize I made mistakes

125
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,390
in some of the previous work and I try

126
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,780
to correct it and amplify and so forth

127
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:47,409
but the way that might be useful is to

128
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,479
present you these four key ideas so that

129
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,590
if you're not bothered by the details

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,580
you might still find it useful to know

131
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:01,270
what these four ideas are and what I

132
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,390
want to also do so that you can in

133
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:09,580
addition to knowing the four key ideas

134
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:13,750
also keep in mind what these compare

135
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:17,109
with or how contextual integrity as a

136
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,650
theory of privacy was an approach to

137
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,930
privacy is differentiated and in some

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,570
ways it's kind of subtly different and

139
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,080
in some ways it's really different so

140
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,510
this is the main idea and if you need to

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,640
leave after this this is the most

142
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,020
important thing for you to remember and

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:41,349
take away from this lecture and that is

144
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:46,120
that contextual integrity or privacy is

145
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:49,780
the appropriate flow of information and

146
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,480
the idea is this both a positive one a

147
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,830
negative one the positive one is to say

148
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,210
as we all know information data flow is

149
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:03,310
really important and there's a lot of

150
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,880
benefit it's the way society operates if

151
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,590
you want to live in society then

152
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:20,020
information about you is going to flow

153
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:24,820
so if you want to if you want to protect

154
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,719
privacy you don't want to stop the flow

155
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,990
of information

156
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,380
you don't want privacy to mean the same

157
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,650
as secrecy which is the stoppage of flow

158
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,630
you want privacy rather to be the

159
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,939
appropriate flow of information

160
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,469
now this runs against some of the ways

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,830
I've heard my computer science

162
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:47,410
colleagues talk about privacy and I've

163
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,510
just spent about I spent about six

164
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,390
months at the Simon's Institution

165
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,250
I had really fabulous discussions with

166
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,090
many of the theoretical computer

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,960
scientists

168
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:02,140
often computer scientists will present a

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,570
theory or present a tool or present a

170
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,949
method and they'll talk about leakage

171
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,779
they'll say how do we prevent leakage

172
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,690
contextual integrity doesn't like that

173
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,720
word if you just use it on its own as if

174
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,730
leakage is a bad thing leakage is not a

175
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,580
bad thing it's only bad if it's

176
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:26,680
inappropriate and so even some of the

177
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,550
privacy engineering community have a

178
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,810
principle called a diamond obsession and

179
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:37,540
contextual integrity says that data

180
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,489
minimization on its own is not

181
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,339
necessarily a good thing

182
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,650
you need to minimize appropriately and

183
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,860
so if you start off with that idea

184
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,959
appropriate flow that is where we begin

185
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,670
with a definition of contextual

186
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,930
integrity now of course you're sitting

187
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,420
there and you're like well what's

188
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,040
appropriate flow and that now we enter

189
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:06,370
into the next key ideas of the theory

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,939
one the the and I haven't miscounted I

191
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,339
just want you to know but there's an

192
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:19,500
interesting connection among these four

193
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:25,470
ideas and they're two definitions or

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:28,990
accounts of appropriate flow one is that

195
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:32,339
appropriate flow is flow that conforms

196
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,020
with social norms and in the legal

197
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,780
domain we often hear of things like

198
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,780
reasonable expectations of privacy so

199
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,910
when we talk about a norm I've also come

200
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,370
to understand that computer scientists

201
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,170
and mathematicians use the term norm in

202
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,540
a different way and a lot of the

203
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,640
disagreement and confusion was that I

204
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,760
was using the term norm in one way and

205
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,459
other and folks were understanding it in

206
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,189
another way so if you prefer it could be

207
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,770
just rule think about it as a rule and

208
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,260
we we live in society there are lots of

209
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,760
norms that govern our behavior we you

210
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:12,420
know governing

211
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:14,949
even at this moment and some of them are

212
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,349
explicit some of them are embodied in

213
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:21,069
law so you'll often have a legal rule

214
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,110
that embodies a social norm sometimes

215
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,570
you'll have legal rules that are just

216
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:29,079
legal rules sometimes you'll simply have

217
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:32,170
conventions of expected ways of behaving

218
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:34,269
and so on so one of the claims is if you

219
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,399
you know in the early days of Google

220
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:39,670
Maps Street View there was an outcry

221
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,850
because people didn't like the fact that

222
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,069
the cameras showed various things and so

223
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,800
people objected to it and they said it's

224
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,839
a privacy violation and the defenders of

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,209
Google Maps Street View said oh but you

226
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,490
know we only showing things that are

227
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:57,729
public you know in public roadways and

228
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,279
in fact what the argue the back the

229
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,800
argument is no actually there is a

230
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,320
difference in the flow of information

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,029
that's caused by Street View because you

232
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,319
don't now have to be standing in front

233
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,720
of someone's house you can be etc and so

234
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,959
that particular technology had violated

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,660
people's expectations and often the

236
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:24,399
expectation that's violated is a signal

237
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,069
of a norm a social norm and then what I

238
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,160
will come to later is the fact that

239
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:32,589
appropriate flow it has a normative

240
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,990
content that is like an ethical or

241
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,079
prescriptive content that you will often

242
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,380
call something appropriate if you think

243
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,729
that it's legitimate and so there needs

244
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,260
to be an idea in there that also

245
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:53,769
explores appropriateness as a normative

246
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:56,829
concept so I'm going to concentrate I'm

247
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:59,470
going to start with this idea which is

248
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:02,920
that appropriate flow is flow that

249
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:08,560
conforms worth norms or rules it meets

250
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,800
our expectations and you see this little

251
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,369
word entrenched and it's quite an

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:20,280
important word because there are lots of

253
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:24,010
norms and I'm sure I could I could

254
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,560
identify some of them that are

255
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,319
entrenched their expectation nobody

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,949
wrote the rule down but we behave in

257
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,440
ways that we learn we absorb from

258
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,810
society and those are the norms that are

259
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,090
calling entrenched and those are the

260
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:45,310
ones that meet expectations so if we say

261
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:48,190
a proprietary norms and what does goes

262
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,489
against those of you who are somewhat

263
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,250
familiar with privacy policy are the

264
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,430
Fair Information practice principles

265
00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:01,690
which were devised in 1973 and then were

266
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:06,099
ultimately embedded in the first Privacy

267
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:09,100
Act of 1974 which was basically a

268
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,430
tragedy because although the people the

269
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,710
the Commission in 1973 said here are the

270
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,930
Fair Information practice principles we

271
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,560
need to embody them in an omnibus

272
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,800
privacy law what happened instead was

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,199
that in 1974 the law was passed but it

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,839
only covered government held databases

275
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,710
and it left the whole commercial domain

276
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,510
I mean that was 1974 and people maybe

277
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,080
didn't have a sense of what was to come

278
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,150
but anyway it goes against the Fair

279
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Information principles and something

280
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:46,090
that we're all very familiar with which

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,030
is the informed consent mechanism and

282
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,870
it's it's often operationalized as

283
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:56,829
notice and choice and we call that a

284
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:59,620
procedural approach to privacy it says

285
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:02,380
that if you follow these in these steps

286
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,390
then you're going to achieve privacy and

287
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,200
the Fair Information practice principles

288
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:11,110
which are really the fundamental of

289
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,540
where we are today in privacy regulation

290
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,960
now some people may say oh there's the

291
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:21,339
US law and in this gdpr which is the

292
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:25,180
European general data protection

293
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,950
regulation also still based on Fair

294
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,109
Information practice principles although

295
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,160
they act that they've added some

296
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,160
substance

297
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,050
of prohibitions into those rules but it

298
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,889
just says okay if you present people

299
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:41,229
with a policy and people agree then

300
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,319
privacy is protected it says nothing

301
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:47,939
about the substance of what the

302
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:51,250
practices are and a contextual integrity

303
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:55,060
rejects that approach but says we need

304
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:58,949
to have rules substantive rules about

305
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:02,888
what flows are and are not allowable

306
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:05,800
so why contextual integrity and so we're

307
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:09,160
diving a little bit more into the theory

308
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,920
itself my own approach so you can see

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,139
entrench contextual norms is to think

310
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,740
about society not as an undifferentiated

311
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:20,589
social space but rather as constituted

312
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:25,720
by a whole variety of different social

313
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:27,689
domains and these domains are oriented

314
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,420
around or you could even think that

315
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:35,170
historically anthropologically they

316
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:40,240
emerge around certain purposes goals and

317
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:43,719
values it could be we want to educate

318
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,569
young and what has evolved around that

319
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,300
is an educational domain or we have

320
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:53,829
health and what's emerged around that is

321
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,290
a domain a healthcare domain or there

322
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:59,500
could be a political domain how do we

323
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:02,620
how do we choose our rulers or our

324
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,619
leaders our political leaders what sorts

325
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,549
of powers they have over us and so forth

326
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:12,188
and and it so that although although I

327
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,260
personally had done a lot of reading in

328
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:17,230
the areas of social philosophy and

329
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,140
social theory and so forth I wasn't I

330
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,900
didn't hang the theory of contextual

331
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,939
integrity on any one particular but

332
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,730
there's a lot of social theory that

333
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,750
construct society in this way as

334
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,750
constituted by these different domains

335
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,840
now this is number three what we're

336
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:43,559
saying is that these contextual

337
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,559
informational norms and

338
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:52,730
information is information flows or

339
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:56,090
practices or policies come conform with

340
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,720
if they conform with entrenched social

341
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,740
norms we say that these flows are

342
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,679
appropriate

343
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,039
what contextual integrity goes on

344
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,950
further to say is that here is the

345
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:16,070
structure of the rule in order to

346
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:19,370
formulate a rule correctly a well-formed

347
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,860
rule for the purpose of knowing where

348
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,768
the privacy is preserved and I feel like

349
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,699
this community maybe understands this

350
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:33,529
idea better than many communities that I

351
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,929
I try to talk to about this is that you

352
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:39,110
need to provide values for these five

353
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:41,769
independent parameters or like three

354
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,719
depending on you on how you count them

355
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:48,559
actors and so just for short this is the

356
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,159
CI tupple someone told me that this is

357
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,750
how you say it and it's actors

358
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,139
information type transmission principle

359
00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:00,080
so when you're describing a practice and

360
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:02,899
you need to figure out or show someone

361
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,740
that this is appropriate this conforms

362
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:11,239
to it contextual integrity you need to

363
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:15,529
specify the sender the subject the

364
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,990
recipient what infant what the type of

365
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:20,659
the information is and the transmission

366
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,179
principle and I'm going to say a little

367
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,220
bit more about all these different

368
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:30,230
parameters but I wanted you just to see

369
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:34,250
one quick example of what the structure

370
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,250
that such a description or a rule might

371
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,639
look like with all the parameters filled

372
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:44,750
in or values for all the parameters so

373
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:47,570
here are an assortment of the now let me

374
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,700
just say this that often the subject in

375
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,168
the sender are the are one and the same

376
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,970
and so it might seem like the only four

377
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:58,600
parameters listed but

378
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,880
in fact you know you have that I did the

379
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,199
the two identified and so it's not a

380
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,020
problem so these are contextual

381
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,799
informational norms the values for the

382
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,408
parameters are expressed as in terms of

383
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,980
roles so it's people not just people

384
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:21,100
it's let's say people acting in certain

385
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,730
capacities and the capacities are very

386
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:29,199
much constitutive of the domain itself

387
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:31,539
so if I say physician you are gonna say

388
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,030
what what's the domain what's the

389
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:40,860
context thank you you know it'll be

390
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,270
healthcare or teacher it's education and

391
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,559
sometimes it's this you know I'm not

392
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,960
saying it's all neatly tied up but the

393
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,470
it's it's not that the context implies

394
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,500
the roles the may be the purposes imply

395
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,230
the roles it's that the roles are part

396
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:03,690
of what constitutes a context

397
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:08,169
information type is the ontology of

398
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:13,659
attributes and again to some extent

399
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:16,539
they're connected to the identity of the

400
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:21,120
context and then finally the third thing

401
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:23,890
which is I have to say I think it's a

402
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,870
contribution but it also is the most

403
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,250
troublesome of the parameters because

404
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,739
this and there's lots of work that still

405
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:36,120
needs to be done on it however what the

406
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,679
transmission principle is is the

407
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,408
constraint under which the information

408
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,620
flows and so what you can see here is

409
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:49,360
that consent is now a transmission

410
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:52,750
principle under this structure and when

411
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,449
you share information with consent that

412
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,870
is the transmission principle but when

413
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,090
you are filing your tax returns and you

414
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,699
have to fill in a thing that says gross

415
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,179
annual income that is not with consent

416
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,220
you are you have

417
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,220
there's coercion or you're standing in

418
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,460
front of a judge your witness you you

419
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:20,630
must answer in in a certain way and they

420
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,970
sometimes more complicated transmission

421
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,100
principles so for example the police

422
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,310
can't just barge into your house and go

423
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,250
searching around if you if you're a

424
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:34,879
suspect they need to get a warrant from

425
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,620
a judge and then they can enter with a

426
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,250
warrant and that is a transmission

427
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,439
principle often in the privacy domain

428
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,810
people forget about the transmission

429
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,550
principle and as we can see with

430
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,980
something like with a warrant

431
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:53,840
that is a critical transmission

432
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:59,260
principle and we depend on that to to to

433
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:05,389
be living in a system where law prevails

434
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:09,190
okay so all the parameters matter here

435
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,960
was one of the excellent expose

436
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,790
experiences that I had as I was I was

437
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,080
presenting this I was part of a large

438
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:20,030
NSF grant and I was presenting early

439
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,620
ideas from contextual integrity many

440
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,280
years ago John Mitchell was in the

441
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,919
audience and he said oh wow we we think

442
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,810
we can provide a formal expression of

443
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,430
these ideas so what what you've what

444
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:35,419
I've already what I've shown you is

445
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:38,090
already digested through a lot of the

446
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,890
help that I got from the folks on this

447
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,939
paper and there was an Oakland paper

448
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:47,540
that was was really successful but in

449
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,610
sitting with these collaborators they

450
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,860
would just ask me questions what about

451
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,399
this what about this what about this and

452
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,409
I think that the the theory became much

453
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,950
more rigorous and precise as a result

454
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:04,880
but what we see here which was rather

455
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,670
satisfying is that and this was a lot to

456
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,080
do to understand data is that if you

457
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:15,290
look at actual law or actual rulemaking

458
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,419
in the United States a lot of the rules

459
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,580
and this comes directly from HIPAA a

460
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,470
covered entity can disclose the

461
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,830
patient's psychotherapy No

462
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:29,870
to the patient only with prior approval

463
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:32,030
from the patient's psychiatrist and so

464
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:36,199
you can see all the parameters being

465
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:38,480
listed in this rule that Health and

466
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,610
Human Services came up with and what I

467
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,650
think I like to present this rule

468
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,899
because this shows you that in some

469
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:48,020
cases it's not actually the data subject

470
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:51,559
that determines fully determines the

471
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,840
information flows so just to pause a

472
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,289
moment and say the way this all works is

473
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,320
that if you if you're interested in

474
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:04,400
analyzing a particular device or a

475
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,070
particular system according to the

476
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,409
theory of contextual integrity what you

477
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,418
do is you need to describe data flows

478
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:15,260
and and this is quite important and

479
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:17,720
quite practically relevant and I don't

480
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,970
know how many people in this room have

481
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,630
developed apps for example but we've

482
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,659
utilized this just in in very low-key

483
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,370
settings where people are developing

484
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:31,309
mobile apps and we said okay you need to

485
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:36,020
first of all map out the data flows and

486
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:39,620
and in and make sure you know you you

487
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:43,010
able to provide the values for these

488
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,399
parameters and then once you have a

489
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:49,059
description of the flows you can do some

490
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:55,909
comparison to make sure that the flows

491
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:58,908
conform with entrenched norms now just

492
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:01,970
to get back and I'm gonna say more about

493
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:05,150
this but I wanted to now elaborate a

494
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,549
little bit more when we subscribe to the

495
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,470
idea that appropriate flow is flow that

496
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:14,299
conforms with entrenched look and

497
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:18,440
contextual rules we've already said that

498
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:21,379
the most universal approach that this

499
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,820
country and GDP are to but that's a

500
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:28,370
longer story has taken to privacy

501
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,129
protection is through this concept of

502
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,659
subject control of information about

503
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,430
ourselves some of you at

504
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,990
how many of you have been following some

505
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:42,180
of the New York Times privacy project

506
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:45,590
you know I think it's a great series of

507
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,150
articles but we started counting and

508
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,470
they're about at least I stopped

509
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:57,480
counting after 20 of those essays all

510
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:00,330
end by saying what we need to do is give

511
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,000
people control over information about

512
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,490
themselves and then the only way we seem

513
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,390
to have to do that is notice a choice

514
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,430
that has a that's a problem but I argue

515
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,420
on the basis of contextual integrity

516
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,700
that saying that the whole arena of

517
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,910
privacy is control over information

518
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,610
about ourselves is to take control which

519
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:27,450
is one transmission principle and make

520
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,889
it into the entire domain of privacy

521
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,550
protection and this is highly

522
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,560
problematic because I argue there

523
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,780
multiple transmission principles and

524
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,040
sometimes we actually don't have a right

525
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:43,950
to control information about ourselves

526
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,530
second another approach to policymaking

527
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,510
is to kind of divide the worlds of

528
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,560
information into sensitive information

529
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:54,780
or not sensitive information and to say

530
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,990
you know privacy regulation only applies

531
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,149
to sensitive information as far as all

532
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,690
the rest of the information anything

533
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,830
goes

534
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:07,760
contextual integrity says no any

535
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:14,399
information and here's my claim any

536
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:19,080
information requires norms or it is

537
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,120
bound by norms of that constrain the

538
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,990
flow of that information it can be

539
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,030
something like your name and we've now

540
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,360
done some empirical research that

541
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,280
validates that idea and finally if

542
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,010
you're building some kind of access

543
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,020
control system you need to be thinking

544
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:41,820
about the values for all of the five

545
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:44,760
parameters not four not three not so

546
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,309
that to argue that

547
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,710
we only need to worry about sensitive

548
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,840
information is problematic because first

549
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,360
of all you're only worrying about one

550
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,059
parameter and second of all instead of

551
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,799
looking at the whole ontology you're

552
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,110
looking you're just dividing the world

553
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,650
into two types of information end of

554
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,409
story

555
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:08,150
now when I say that access control rules

556
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:14,070
have to govern all for the practical

557
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:18,960
situation is that sometimes access

558
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:21,899
control rules make assumptions about the

559
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,850
outside world and it may be that you're

560
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:29,700
not able to represent or model all of

561
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:33,270
the five parameters and you need to make

562
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:40,530
an assumption about for example let's

563
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:46,590
say you building something that's only

564
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:49,230
about men's health then you don't you

565
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,678
may you may not need to specify well I

566
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,429
don't know you may need to but you if

567
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:59,100
you if you if it's if you know that the

568
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:01,650
the the system is going to be used

569
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,340
within a certain domain and only certain

570
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:09,260
parties are going to have access to - -

571
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,330
it may be through some kind of

572
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,000
authentication mechanism then you can

573
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,540
get away with using the external device

574
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,510
to already constrain for example who the

575
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,600
recipients are and then the rules within

576
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:27,540
that system don't need to specify all

577
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,030
five so when I say you need to specify

578
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,980
all five I'm realistic about the fact

579
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,379
that sometimes you're not able to

580
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,780
represent all of those five within the

581
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,210
system and you need to control some of

582
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,090
those parameters outside of the system

583
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:46,200
and I mean anybody whose model anything

584
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:50,399
knows that it's not just a restriction

585
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:54,210
on this kind of thing so this is just a

586
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,490
slide that says here is the work that we

587
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,410
need to do having gotten as far with

588
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,049
contextual integrity

589
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,030
we need to you know I talked a lot about

590
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,789
entrenched norms some of these

591
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,889
entrenched norms are quite intuitive and

592
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:11,160
and some of them are expressed in law

593
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:16,380
and so we can figure out what they are

594
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:19,590
but because we're in this domain so some

595
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,679
of the some of the controversy around

596
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:26,459
Inge surrounding the platform's for

597
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:31,890
example or mobile apps we there's a mess

598
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:35,460
and some of the more predatory data

599
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:38,700
practices take advantage of the fact

600
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,830
that we haven't we as a society we

601
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,640
haven't really figured we haven't done

602
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:49,500
research which teaches us what the

603
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,919
robust implicit norms are and so this is

604
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,559
really ok read here's the code read is

605
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,659
what I think is mainly in the in the

606
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,570
domain of social scientists and

607
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,320
communication scholars and so on for us

608
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,879
to learn more about what our

609
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,010
expectations are and that tons of

610
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,919
studies now Mechanical Turk is the

611
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,900
favorite platform to try and extract and

612
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,280
be more precise about what some of those

613
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:19,380
norms are the blue is what I think

614
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,260
mainly is in the domain of computer

615
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:26,659
science and it could be systems people

616
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:33,059
or security folks networking and theory

617
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:35,100
crypto to not necessarily only think

618
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:39,299
about the case you know the standard

619
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:41,610
case of Alice Bob and Eve but to

620
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:44,940
appreciate and I'm sure you do some of

621
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:48,418
them much more complex circumstances so

622
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,600
at the moment I'm working with some

623
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,210
folks on on smart or autonomous vehicles

624
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,158
and if you think about those vehicle

625
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,610
communication systems I remember way

626
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,289
back about a decade ago working with Dan

627
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:05,760
Bonet who had some really clever

628
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:07,950
cryptographic system to say well you

629
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,679
don't really need to know who the driver

630
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,700
is but you need to be still be able to

631
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,419
identify

632
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,760
the car for purposes of coordination and

633
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,860
that's I think what your what this

634
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,990
community is really expert at is to

635
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:28,289
provide ways of constraining information

636
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:32,090
flow that respects the norms that

637
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:35,340
respect the constraints while allowing

638
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,629
systems to continue functioning not

639
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:44,809
grind to a halt and then you know these

640
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:47,159
other these other activities the purple

641
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:50,100
which is the red and the blue together

642
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:54,000
is ways in which I think is really

643
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:57,149
important for us to work together on a

644
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,200
common problem now if you're thinking

645
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:04,129
about just with the lens of privacy as

646
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,280
control your life is a little bit easier

647
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,040
when you operationalize control there's

648
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,540
just this one thing you have to

649
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,849
operationalize which is giving control

650
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,849
and of course as we all know that the

651
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:21,000
current notice and choice regime is

652
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:23,700
highly ineffective and we're sitting

653
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,339
with this policy because it's very

654
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,310
convenient for the information platform

655
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,589
providers and others you know mobile

656
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,139
platform providers it's very convenient

657
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:37,909
because it pretty much allows them to do

658
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:40,649
anything and what we need is

659
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,659
unfortunately more complicated but I

660
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,270
think would give us much better privacy

661
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,329
so some of the work we are doing within

662
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:50,929
our group is empirical studies that

663
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:54,569
question some of the ages old

664
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:56,550
assumptions about privacy and I don't

665
00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,150
have so much time so I'm not going to go

666
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:03,180
into it and here's another way we have a

667
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,060
platform that tries to govern

668
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,348
information flow now within an

669
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,279
institutional setting so we don't have

670
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:15,020
to take care of all you know a ton of

671
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,940
values for the different parameters and

672
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,030
their lot there's just lots more to do

673
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,369
and as I mentioned other people are also

674
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,810
doing it now I don't know you know it's

675
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,510
hard to follow a particular

676
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,400
talk just if it's the first time you

677
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,620
ever encountering it but there's

678
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,060
something that I'm wondering maybe this

679
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:38,279
is really bothering you and that is that

680
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:40,830
the whole reason we're here today I mean

681
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm here today is that it's technology

682
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:47,220
and the technology is disruptive a lot

683
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:51,509
of this technology that we all love or

684
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:57,439
love to hate has disrupted information

685
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:57,440
flows that's number one and number two

686
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:12,900
it may be that we have flows that sorry

687
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:16,200
I'm just that we just don't have norms

688
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,300
for and they're troubling but there

689
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,700
doesn't seem get to become an agreement

690
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,860
about what the right thing to do is and

691
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,730
so basically whoever is the more

692
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,890
powerful whoever has the neat act is

693
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,300
going to be the one that defines the

694
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:34,500
flows and we just sit around passively

695
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,990
hoping that nothing bad is going to

696
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,540
happen to us and there are a whole lot

697
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,459
of other reasons why the entrenched

698
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,060
approach is problematic

699
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,340
now I had in early days not actually

700
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,920
developed as part of the theory because

701
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,650
I was really in love with the idea that

702
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,010
you know society has these entrenched

703
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,560
norms we look at the Hippocratic oath

704
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,930
we've evolved these norms of a centuries

705
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,910
and there's the wisdom of the ages and

706
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,339
you know we should go with that but you

707
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,259
can't be conservative in that way and

708
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,300
say no change is possible

709
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,700
and everything's of the privacy

710
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,180
violation if it violates an entrenched

711
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,580
norm so we need some approach to march

712
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,940
into this new domain and be able to

713
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:23,520
evaluate not only our own entrenched

714
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:29,540
norms like slavery is an extreme example

715
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:32,690
but also to evaluate new practices new

716
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,770
institutions that are being thrust on us

717
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,290
where let's say Mark Zuckerberg is

718
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:40,990
saying Oh Facebook has changed the norms

719
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:45,640
and we're sitting there saying no you've

720
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:47,649
changed the practice but what basis on

721
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,589
what basis are you saying that the norm

722
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:53,770
has changed and so now coming back to

723
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:56,080
our diagram we're gonna look at this

724
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:59,650
number four cuz you know now we have got

725
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,680
a number three which is how do we look

726
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,380
at some new practice or even an

727
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,680
entrenched norm and evaluate whether

728
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:11,530
it's okay or not and I use this

729
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,210
philosophical concept of legitimate but

730
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:17,520
it can be something like is it worth

731
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:21,880
defending is it morally justifiable and

732
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,730
contextual integrity offers three steps

733
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,190
to thinking about this and you know it's

734
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:30,730
I have just not too many minutes and I'm

735
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:33,070
going to go a little bit quickly the

736
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,770
interests we need to do a kind of

737
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:39,040
economic analysis when we look at some

738
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:42,490
of these new practices and say how who's

739
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,759
harmed use who benefits standard

740
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,379
economic policy analysis and then

741
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,570
there's a discussion of political

742
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,490
principles you know does this diminish

743
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,480
freedom of speech and we've seen a lot

744
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:57,609
of analysis of this in in the media is

745
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,600
it biased does it does it create

746
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:03,490
unfairness and that's the second line

747
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,100
but it's really the third line that I

748
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,459
want to emphasize which comes directly

749
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:12,220
out of the contextual approach which is

750
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,350
you know contextual integrity which is

751
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,049
what I said at the beginning of the talk

752
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:20,710
is that context are constituted around

753
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,020
purposes and values so imagine the

754
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,910
Martian landing in a university and

755
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,390
sending back the description of what a

756
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:30,609
university is or what a school is

757
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:34,480
describes everything that's going on but

758
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:37,390
doesn't say what we're doing in a

759
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,660
university what a school is trying to do

760
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:44,920
the purposes I think we would all admit

761
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,830
that they're missing a major point about

762
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,560
these base

763
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,140
institutions of society and so what

764
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,529
conditional integrity argues is yes you

765
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,980
discuss interests yes you talk about

766
00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:01,810
some of these very highly abstract

767
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:05,120
values but what's also important is

768
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:07,220
contextual ends and purposes and here

769
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,279
are just a few I'm not going to go

770
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:13,240
through them but I also wanted to show

771
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:19,610
you that this is an intuitive idea and

772
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:22,399
here in 1925 when tax returns that the

773
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,860
tax information that we provide to the

774
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,130
IRS went from being public information

775
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,710
to being information that was now held

776
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,110
in enormous confidence as we've been

777
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:37,190
learning increasingly in the past year

778
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:39,830
and a half by the IRS and Andrew

779
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,110
Mellon's argument was not like oh you

780
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:45,110
know people have a right to privacy in

781
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:49,700
their in their tax returns his argument

782
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:51,770
was we want people to say honestly what

783
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,470
they earn what they're worth and that's

784
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:57,800
important so that the Treasury could

785
00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:00,310
benefit from taxing them and so one

786
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,620
reason why people might want to hide

787
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:05,600
their earnings is because it's being

788
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,759
blasted to the world imagine you know

789
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,190
your family your large family learns

790
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,500
that you really quite wealthy and how

791
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:16,790
many people will come and hit you up for

792
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:19,430
loans and whatnot so and he succeeded

793
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:23,240
that argument succeeded so we're saying

794
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:26,980
and health care is the same if someone

795
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:32,890
has a contagious or infectious disease

796
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:36,110
may not report for testing and that's

797
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:39,850
problematic not only for the person but

798
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:42,580
for social societal health and so we

799
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:45,770
insist on very stringent privacy

800
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:50,000
regulation in health care in order to

801
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:54,640
promote health and so forth now this is

802
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,990
here's the not part of it this is

803
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,480
different from some other approaches

804
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,339
who insists that privacy's only about

805
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,820
the data subject actually there are two

806
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,150
things

807
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,790
and please do those of you who stayed

808
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,220
are still here the first really

809
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:14,400
important point to take away is that

810
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:17,149
it's not secrecy it's a appropriate flow

811
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,700
and the second important point is

812
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:24,119
privacy is valuable not only for the

813
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:28,618
individual but for social integrity as

814
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:31,380
well privacy promotes contextual ends

815
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,290
and purposes and that's why it's

816
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,080
important so all those times that you

817
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,810
hear people say oh you've got to give up

818
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,569
some of your privacy in order to you

819
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,730
know improve health

820
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:47,730
now that you've sat in this room you

821
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:51,420
have to reject what they're saying and

822
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:54,540
say no because an adequate approach to

823
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:59,010
privacy will say that an appropriate

824
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:01,980
flow of information has to be shaped so

825
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:06,330
that it can serve individual interest

826
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:09,390
but also is well designed if it also

827
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,700
promotes the contextual ends and we've

828
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,400
been looking at some examples of that in

829
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:17,368
in politics and education and so forth

830
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,740
and the third wall you know a lot of

831
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:22,170
people who do differential privacy will

832
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,950
say you know privacy versus utility and

833
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:29,430
I hope that we can get past that because

834
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:32,850
privacy is not instead of utility

835
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:35,460
privacy conserve utility but you just

836
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:39,230
have to stop thinking about privacy as

837
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:42,060
secrecy as stoppage of flow but rather

838
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:47,100
appropriate flow and sometimes that will

839
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:48,960
serve utility so I wanted to bring up

840
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,420
this because many of us have seen his

841
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,510
images through the lens of contextual

842
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,930
integrity the sin of Cambridge

843
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:01,470
analytical was not that this information

844
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:05,430
was shared without consent of the data

845
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:08,759
subjects it was a problem because it has

846
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,790
these because of destabilize democracy

847
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,750
and when we try solve it we

848
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:18,960
say hey Facebook next time ask people

849
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,700
because you know that 95% of people are

850
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,440
not even reading and they're gonna just

851
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:27,600
click you need to think we need to think

852
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:33,150
about how this is going to affect these

853
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:35,430
deeply valued purposes so I mean here

854
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,440
are just a few little examples which I'm

855
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,660
not going to go through this is my last

856
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,750
law I can come back to those if you like

857
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,990
but I did want to leave some time for

858
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:49,190
discussion the heuristic that we come up

859
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:51,779
with for practical purposes is to

860
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,420
discover the relevant norms or

861
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,270
expectation contextual norms expectation

862
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:01,370
map flows in terms of the parameters

863
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:06,900
check conformance and performance

864
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:10,049
legitimacy analysis now having built the

865
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,540
big picture we still subscribe to what I

866
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:15,960
had said earlier about what contextual

867
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:18,810
integrity needs us to learn to be a

868
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,030
functioning theory and that is that

869
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,840
people like myself and legal scholars

870
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:26,940
and so forth

871
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:29,040
we have to understand the imple with the

872
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,070
Facebook Cambridge and analytical we

873
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,110
really need to dive deeply into the

874
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:38,400
consequences of these for individual

875
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:41,280
social values and how they affect some

876
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,640
of the constitutional laws in the case

877
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,370
of the u.s. some of the values the Bill

878
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,560
of Rights to which we're committed to

879
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,960
and presumably different countries and

880
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,170
different cultures would have different

881
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,580
norms we need to move beyond this

882
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:02,490
obsession and I can say that the number

883
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:06,090
of articles that has been that have been

884
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:09,959
written about you know let's analyze

885
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:12,900
privacy policies and compliance and so

886
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,240
forth is is kind of mind-boggling and I

887
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:20,870
don't think in the end is going to serve

888
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:24,330
privacy very well we need in my opinion

889
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:25,200
economic and game theoretic methods for

890
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:28,828
figuring

891
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,129
what optimal policies or substantive

892
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:36,059
rules because sometimes you know just

893
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,980
very and creative laws are not

894
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:41,069
necessarily going to give us the

895
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:44,280
appropriate flows that are legitimate

896
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:46,680
and important and then of course I think

897
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,270
but back to the what we can do in the

898
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:55,368
computer science and crypto community is

899
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:59,790
help us figure out smart ways to enforce

900
00:46:55,369 --> 00:47:04,200
flow policy policies and express them in

901
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:07,250
technical systems and devices I guess

902
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:19,828
that's the end thanks a lot

903
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:19,829
[Applause]

904
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:32,180
um it is this on okay so it's an

905
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:37,250
interesting way of thinking about things

906
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:44,480
and I thank you for the talk the problem

907
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:46,520
that we face is that we do need control

908
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,490
because although you can talk about

909
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,340
appropriate flow there's a problem of

910
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:56,270
preventing inappropriate flow that's

911
00:47:52,340 --> 00:48:01,480
very hard some other complications are

912
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:06,110
the lack of permanence the rules change

913
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:09,850
the data is owned by new people and the

914
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,850
interpretation of appropriateness

915
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:17,480
disintegrates over time and then there's

916
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:20,540
a monotonicity principle the amount of

917
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:25,990
information that is disclosed about you

918
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:29,029
simply increases over your lifetime so

919
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:30,830
maybe it's a secondary part of your

920
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,830
theory to address some of these other

921
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:37,460
problems I'd like to know your views yes

922
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:41,930
no I think those are all very good

923
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:44,450
points when I talk about control the

924
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,990
main and maybe I wasn't clear enough I

925
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,600
mean

926
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:51,350
control about information about

927
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:54,859
ourselves by the data subject and what I

928
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:59,420
was objecting to is that we're where we

929
00:48:54,859 --> 00:49:02,810
are today for the most part is that we

930
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:05,960
think that a bilateral agreement between

931
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:10,160
the data collector and processor with

932
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:13,340
the data subject is what privacy amounts

933
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,430
to and the argument here is first of all

934
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,980
that is not going to be for the benefit

935
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,720
of the individual especially for the

936
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,690
reasons that he raised about how

937
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:28,250
complicated the data environment has

938
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:30,970
become and second of all because

939
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:33,859
there's the societal impact and

940
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,390
sometimes people don't have a right to

941
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:38,950
control information about ourselves

942
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:41,960
because it's not beneficial for

943
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:45,500
promoting societal ends and you may

944
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,770
disagree with me on that school because

945
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,869
you may just think that on the issues of

946
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,020
information about ourselves it's sort of

947
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:56,780
like nobody's going to tell me who I can

948
00:49:54,020 --> 00:50:01,400
marry for example it's just

949
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:04,250
fundamentally my choice then we just you

950
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,320
know then we part company I mean I'm

951
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,500
just responding to some of your points

952
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,840
the question of change is precisely what

953
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:15,830
that second part of the theory tries to

954
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:19,580
address because norms also change over

955
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:22,400
time circumstances hurricanes we become

956
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,619
smarter we become hopefully more ethical

957
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,440
we have to have a system that allows

958
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:30,560
this change to take place and this is an

959
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,280
attempt to give some kind of systematic

960
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,950
approach to that thank you very much for

961
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,510
your talk a very refreshing refreshing

962
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,129
view and I think much more productive

963
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,680
and a lot of the discussions I think are

964
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,980
I met confused you seem to focus very

965
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:48,339
much on the flow of data and to me the

966
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,810
use of data is a much bigger issue

967
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:54,560
maybe you encompass it in the flow but

968
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:58,790
it wasn't yeah yes thank you for raising

969
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:02,839
this very difficult important question

970
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:05,450
so it's and it's a debate that started

971
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:09,080
out early the theory describes these

972
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:12,410
norms which are norms of flow and the

973
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:14,810
critics of that even friends said Helen

974
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,089
you've got to do something about use and

975
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:21,080
I said I don't need to do anything about

976
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:26,869
use two reasons one is that a physician

977
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:29,089
or the role implies use so insane

978
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:31,130
physician we have some implicit

979
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:34,190
assumption about what the physician is

980
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:41,180
doing with that data and second of all

981
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:43,849
with with the outcomes of use we can cap

982
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,759
that when we look at the evaluation of

983
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:51,319
the norms interest values and contextual

984
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:55,279
purposes which was fine until about ten

985
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:58,609
fifty you know okay five years ago when

986
00:51:55,279 --> 00:52:02,359
actors large platforms and and

987
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:05,029
information services companies really

988
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:08,390
blossomed and became these global giants

989
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:11,510
and accumulated data from all walks of

990
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:14,390
life and didn't think twice about just

991
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,680
pulling all this data and we didn't know

992
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,900
what they were

993
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,750
you know we they didn't have a fixed

994
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:25,250
role in nineteen I don't know when it

995
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:28,309
was twenty five eighty five there was

996
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:31,640
the Telecommunications Act in the United

997
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:34,910
States and they've defined the role of a

998
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,490
telecom provider they say this is what

999
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:41,359
it is and by the way here is how we're

1000
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:44,240
gonna regulate your data flow you can't

1001
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,089
record calls you can listen to a few

1002
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,729
snatches for quality of service you can

1003
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:52,700
record metadata well I'm just calling it

1004
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:55,099
metadata and so they stipulated that but

1005
00:52:52,700 --> 00:53:01,160
we living with this and the problem here

1006
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:05,779
is that these because we don't know

1007
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:08,000
these parties they're just using the

1008
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:11,059
data in multiple different and I'm

1009
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,960
thinking non contextual ways excuse me

1010
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:18,770
sorry and so I now agree we need to have

1011
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,750
use that's a long but yes I think we now

1012
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,130
have to have a use parameter and how

1013
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,430
we're gonna and I'm working with people

1014
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:27,380
I mean how are we gonna do it I actually

1015
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:30,169
think that a lot of your theory just

1016
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,980
applies to both things and maybe have a

1017
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:35,900
float or word processing of data

1018
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,460
encompassing both the use and flow or

1019
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,250
you can define the flow within an

1020
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,010
organization but that's very easy to

1021
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:46,520
misunderstand yes and and how to do it

1022
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:48,890
is still something that I'm thinking of

1023
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,040
but because of where we are today we

1024
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:55,390
need to have a use parameter

1025
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:57,310
thank you thanks ed actually to just

1026
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,930
follow them that I was actually or

1027
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:01,180
someone or things I wanted to bring up

1028
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,310
so first I very much appreciate your

1029
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:06,490
your perspective I think it's great the

1030
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,779
thing about this as flow as a contextual

1031
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,979
thing and to think about data as

1032
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,200
something that doesn't necessarily

1033
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:14,530
belong to one person or another you know

1034
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:18,520
with it's a it's the right way to think

1035
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:21,220
about it but so uses which I think the

1036
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,200
produces two least two different

1037
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:26,470
components that has to be addressed one

1038
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,000
is the aggregation of data you know the

1039
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:30,910
whole is much more than the sum of the

1040
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,720
parts and as you say all this you might

1041
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:36,940
and and the in and the no theory will be

1042
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,709
completely meaningful without addressing

1043
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:43,600
that and it's practice showed us and and

1044
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:45,640
the other thing is that the flow of

1045
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,470
information should be thought of a

1046
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,509
circular right because it also comes

1047
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,359
back to us it not just what flows the

1048
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:54,670
way to us from us the world comes to us

1049
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,470
right when I've been shown ads that have

1050
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,930
you know biased or whatever that's not

1051
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:01,230
what coming out is what's coming in and

1052
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:05,049
and the whole thing is one big ecosystem

1053
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:07,540
that cannot talk about it sounds to me

1054
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:13,360
yeah so I won't address the coming in

1055
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:15,430
part but I do want to mention two things

1056
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,590
I have an article anyone's interested

1057
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,819
it's called contextual integrity up and

1058
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:27,640
down the data food chain where I look at

1059
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:30,430
how we have adapted to certain this

1060
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,410
problem that you mention everyone you

1061
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:37,029
know doing machine learning and so forth

1062
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:41,170
is really relevant that sometimes we can

1063
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:43,600
adjust norms to learn from what we see

1064
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,330
so I think we were very good about

1065
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,370
Social Security number back in the day

1066
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:51,040
because we saw that that accumulated a

1067
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:53,200
lot of information around it and then we

1068
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,200
could do all sorts of things and then

1069
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,870
suddenly you know everybody was asking

1070
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:02,049
what's your social security number stop

1071
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:04,150
because we realize how how

1072
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:08,290
wheeling that was however I think we're

1073
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:11,530
moving at such a speed so in the cases

1074
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:14,050
where the norms can't catch up to the

1075
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:17,890
practices precisely because of what I'm

1076
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:20,620
calling the the data food chain we need

1077
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:23,319
to then I mean I think their flow won't

1078
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:26,490
help we need to go directly to purposes

1079
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:29,110
and we need to say is it worth it that

1080
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:31,629
companies are surveilling every move we

1081
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,300
make online and now increasingly with

1082
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:37,810
smart cities and that in physical space

1083
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:42,010
is it worth it so that I can get an ad

1084
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:45,930
that even if I'm interested in it expose

1085
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:48,520
myself to this how entire system and

1086
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:51,100
that's the kind of question is it worth

1087
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:56,650
it is it worth it to do that if it's

1088
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:59,110
going to stop plagues maybe so we need

1089
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:02,110
to do it responsibly we need to have

1090
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:08,140
that discussion of what's worth it and I

1091
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:10,510
don't think we are yet my question is

1092
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,190
related to the information processing

1093
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,540
issue

1094
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,240
and I'm just wondering how you deal with

1095
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:19,180
rules that might be just contradictory

1096
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,189
to each other so you can imagine that we

1097
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,259
think it's okay for information X to be

1098
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:25,510
released to someone and we might also

1099
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,470
really not want information Y to be

1100
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:31,420
released without realizing that Y can be

1101
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:37,209
inferred from X you know how you would

1102
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:41,080
address that kind of issue I mean you

1103
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:43,840
know it's a big problem and one of the

1104
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:47,410
issues about having these platforms that

1105
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:50,320
are gathering you know information 360

1106
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:52,420
degrees with just no no we have this

1107
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,430
political economy of information at the

1108
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,220
moment which is basically if you own it

1109
00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:01,330
you can do what the heck you like so you

1110
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:05,470
can you know buy a blood processing lab

1111
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:08,319
and you can be talking about a consumer

1112
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:10,120
practice and there's no sense that

1113
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,900
they actually should be rules even

1114
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:17,109
within single ownership that stops that

1115
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:19,300
kind of processing and merging of the

1116
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:23,040
information I mean it's sad because

1117
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:26,470
we've kind of it would take a lot of

1118
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,750
rhetorical force to push the dial back a

1119
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,490
little bit so but but there's a little

1120
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,640
help you can get from the extra

1121
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:40,020
parameters you and that which is to say

1122
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:44,470
I'm prepared to give X to a and Y to be

1123
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:48,040
but I know that if they merge this data

1124
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:50,919
like data brokers we have a problem and

1125
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,620
if we think contextually in terms of

1126
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,490
ends and purposes and values I think we

1127
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,359
can protect against some of it but not

1128
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:04,390
all of it

1129
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:08,050
so thank you I don't know yeah are you a

1130
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:08,560
next really interesting talk thank you

1131
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:11,380
very much

1132
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,610
um one of the one of my questions though

1133
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,860
and perhaps it's because I'm

1134
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:16,960
misunderstanding when you talk about the

1135
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,940
attributes the sender the recipient and

1136
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,820
the subject especially with your example

1137
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:25,120
on the psychiatrist it didn't talk about

1138
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:27,760
the data origin yeah so in that

1139
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:32,080
particular example the psychiatrist was

1140
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:34,840
the origin of the data and so clearly

1141
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:37,720
should have controlled the notes yeah so

1142
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,580
I'm wondering why data origin isn't part

1143
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,640
of those attributes because in some

1144
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:45,190
cases right it's method collection and

1145
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,509
and other things are being protected by

1146
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:51,430
the data yes

1147
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:53,010
and I do think that there is a kind of

1148
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:56,169
misleading way in which we think about

1149
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:58,720
data as like just stuff lying around

1150
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:02,190
that people go and gather when in fact

1151
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:05,649
data is very much a construct and

1152
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:08,500
strange you should say but we had a

1153
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:11,110
small dollar grant with a few of us and

1154
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,180
we started talking about origin it may

1155
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:17,950
not satisfy you but if you if you look

1156
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:20,259
for that I think we had a public head I

1157
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:22,080
think it's out already but we did talk

1158
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:25,800
about it's not to say that the

1159
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:28,259
originator necessarily sort of owns but

1160
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:32,160
that the originator of the data is a

1161
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:36,240
relevant question to ask and can affect

1162
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:40,680
the flows so I mean that's all I think

1163
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,279
you're right yeah yeah so thank you for

1164
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,330
your talk

1165
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,710
I was wondering we were discussing how

1166
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:48,900
contextual integrity chooses not to see

1167
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,970
society as one cohesive whole I think in

1168
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,070
your second point I was wondering how

1169
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:54,870
this interacted with the lawful side of

1170
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,940
things does it for example advocate that

1171
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:58,799
different groups who have different

1172
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,360
norms about appropriate data flow should

1173
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,000
be subject to different laws because it

1174
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:06,870
seems like that could be rather a bit of

1175
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,180
a Pandora's box I'm not I didn't hear

1176
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,650
every word you said but I'll try answer

1177
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,549
and then you couldn't tell me if I got

1178
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:18,960
it right this is an interesting question

1179
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:20,640
because many people will say that Europe

1180
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,700
is much more advanced in thinking about

1181
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:27,210
privacy than the US because they have

1182
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:30,109
this kind of omnibus omnibus approach to

1183
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:34,350
saying we're gonna have one regulation

1184
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:39,180
like one size fits all actually it also

1185
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:41,569
devolves to something called purpose

1186
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:44,730
binding and and and

1187
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:49,710
purpose can sometimes map onto what I

1188
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:51,870
call contextual in the u.s. we have

1189
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:54,990
what's known as the sectoral approach

1190
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:57,750
where we do in fact have they're just

1191
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:01,049
bad the problem is that they're bad but

1192
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:04,920
the general idea of having a slightly

1193
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:09,620
lower level but more specific set of

1194
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:14,610
regulations for some of the major

1195
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:17,520
domains is I think important and the

1196
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:20,040
reason it is is that someone like myself

1197
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,650
who's a privacy theorist don't come and

1198
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,200
ask me what the rules should be for

1199
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:27,180
finance or for healthcare or for

1200
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,060
education the people who are writing

1201
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:34,080
those rules need to be experts in those

1202
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:35,400
domains so that's sort of to put the

1203
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,740
positive spin

1204
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,279
I'm thinking of society and law does a

1205
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:44,069
to law there's commercial law there's

1206
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:47,609
there's private law there's public law

1207
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:51,799
so even though we have the Constitution

1208
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:56,670
that has some very high-level abstract

1209
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:58,980
values that where the other laws really

1210
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:02,249
need to you know because you challenges

1211
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,269
to laws based on conflicts with the

1212
01:03:02,249 --> 01:03:06,180
Constitution

1213
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:10,019
I think of privacy rules as a little bit

1214
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:13,379
like that and I would like to see those

1215
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:16,618
sectoral rules improved a lot and not

1216
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:20,880
always have this little switch that says

1217
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:23,849
these rules hold blah blah blah except

1218
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,890
if the data subject gives permission for

1219
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:28,740
something else which if you look at all

1220
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:31,200
the laws that we have on the books has

1221
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:34,379
this weird exception probably not in

1222
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:40,259
some of like national security

1223
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:42,059
regulation I'm just curious about

1224
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:43,589
something which was on one of your

1225
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:46,829
slides so what's a problem with the

1226
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:50,279
number of spoons in your coffee what

1227
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:51,809
what since they were in one of your

1228
01:03:50,279 --> 01:03:53,849
slides there was a problem of

1229
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:56,519
transmitting the number of spoons of

1230
01:03:53,849 --> 01:04:08,880
sugar in your coffee that's the problem

1231
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:12,738
of Otzi's actually it was just before

1232
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,739
the sexual orientation

1233
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,260
[Music]

1234
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:31,490
no no wow I think I was saying and this

1235
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:35,089
was in this do you mind that I'm just

1236
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:37,790
doing this kind of thinking which is I

1237
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:40,790
wanted I wanted in the work in which I

1238
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:44,600
challenged this dichotomy of public and

1239
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:46,700
private I was arguing that this

1240
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,670
information that's personal because I

1241
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,140
said like this actually many different

1242
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:54,380
dichotomies and there's information

1243
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:59,569
that's personal this information that

1244
01:04:54,380 --> 01:05:02,480
may be sensitive and but that was before

1245
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:05,360
I went on and said uh actually they're

1246
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,340
these contextual ontology something like

1247
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,940
how many spoons of sugar you have in

1248
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:11,270
your coffee

1249
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:14,720
you could say is personal but it's not

1250
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:17,540
sensitive unless it's a health insurance

1251
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:21,939
company in the sense that if somebody

1252
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:26,779
learns that you you could face harms and

1253
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:29,240
this was early argumentation against the

1254
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:31,910
claim that you can divide the entire

1255
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:37,419
world into the public and private I'm

1256
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:37,420
sorry I just blanked on that one yeah I

1257
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:48,110
think you're not addressing the real

1258
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:52,640
problem this is a this is the deck

1259
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:56,900
chairs on the Titanic problem you know

1260
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,170
we're asking detailed questions and the

1261
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:03,550
boats taking on water and we need me

1262
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:03,550
need to address Zuckerberg

1263
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,040
[Music]

1264
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:25,440
but how you know how how are we going to

1265
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:30,900
do it because we're a country of laws so

1266
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:33,420
we need to provide the way in with the

1267
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:36,750
camera the reason I use that cambric

1268
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:40,710
analytic a case is that I want to excite

1269
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:43,560
people into realizing that it's not just

1270
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:46,320
a question of me personally controlling

1271
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,930
but actually what some of the companies

1272
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,240
are doing and and Facebook is very

1273
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:55,410
visible but I think data brokers are a

1274
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:57,180
case in point the mobile operating

1275
01:06:55,410 --> 01:07:00,569
systems I mean they're quite a few

1276
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:02,720
companies that are in this space their

1277
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:07,290
data practices can undermine democracy

1278
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:12,209
not if our regulators cannot respond to

1279
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:15,150
that I think that that's that's a

1280
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:17,160
problem and and that's the sort of thing

1281
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:20,910
we need to communicate because that will

1282
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:24,410
get us the foot in the door anyway

1283
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:24,410
thanks for yeah

1284
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,119
[Applause]
