1
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:10,340
thanks for the introduction so this is

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,769
during the walk without going nowhere

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,870
the seawater and the

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:18,580
protein I'm Kafka Minamata from anything

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:21,450
cooperation so the topic way is OCB - so

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,348
it is an authenticated encryption and

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,630
authenticate the encryption is a

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,930
symmetric key function for

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:31,210
confidentiality and authenticity and its

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,910
syntax consists of the DD barrier words

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:36,910
so we have key here nonsense

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,709
print exam and associate data a which is

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,949
a part of the input that is not

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,680
encrypted about must be authenticated on

15
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,239
taking the DD topo at an encryption

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,739
alpha and input to the encryption

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,159
function upon the authenticated

18
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:54,610
encryption it creates a cipher text and

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:58,030
authentication toggle T and the topo and

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,190
a city will be sent to the receiver only

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,769
sipping it the decryption function

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,530
checks if the whole input is authentic

23
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,360
or not and if it is authentic

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,159
there are print X will be returned the

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,780
other wiser error message will be

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:17,469
returned so we have some popular a

27
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,929
schemes most notably the tuna stole the

28
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:23,350
commended mode of operation GCM and

29
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:26,500
cesium and also either one nine seven

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,600
seven to define the six schemes and

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,329
there are some internet standards

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,390
specified by RFC s such as the GCM and

33
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:37,749
the church a 20.per a ones 305 some so

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,359
on and we all listen to activities on

35
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:42,039
the competition of dollars let's get the

36
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:47,499
encryption called the scissor define the

37
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:49,840
six schemes okay so she be it's a more

38
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:53,229
cell related a mode of operation having

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,630
strong features such that now it is a

40
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,639
later one it allows a later operation I

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,829
mean that and it is also faster the

42
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:04,479
encryption only mode such as counter

43
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:06,389
mode and it is paralyzed abow and it's

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,130
other provable security reduction to the

45
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:12,720
pseudo randomness of the underlying rock

46
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,980
cipher or she be had the three versions

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,470
the first version

48
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,760
proposed by a longer way to are at CES

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,340
2001 and the second version which is our

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,540
target was proposed by log away our two

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,739
age equipped mm OH

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,599
four and the finally the oshi b3 was the

53
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:38,140
proposed bike robits on the rollaway in

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:40,929
FSC 2011 okay and all more all families

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,988
of LCB has been extensively studied from

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,760
security perspective for example the

57
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:48,790
tightness of security bans had to be

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,620
investigated and the limitation against

59
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,340
announced missiles and other type of

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,780
missile attack has been investigated

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,310
necessity of the strong pseudonyms of

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,480
the enduring rocks I ever had mean

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,150
yesterday

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,179
and finally therefore OSHA p3 that

65
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,389
abound improvement regarding the

66
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:11,159
decryption decryption complexity has

67
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:14,799
been shown there are many more works and

68
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,840
we did works the or she be as a familiar

69
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,889
with the mode as a one of the most

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:25,750
studied a mode of operation so we have a

71
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:31,120
strong belief on its security but he

72
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:35,949
turns been wrong yeah ok so in this talk

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,389
I showed some structure weakness CC b2

74
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,370
which is the independent of the

75
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,760
underlying block cipher and it's block

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:47,650
size and it has been overlooked for

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,319
around 15 years since the proposal based

78
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,750
on this we derived the several divesting

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,909
attacks for authenticity attack we

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,720
proposed both eg station and the new

81
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:00,819
booster forgeries for confidentiality we

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,970
start with a basic distinguishing attack

83
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:06,819
to more powerful the plaintext to who

84
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,829
protects to recovery and all attacks

85
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,698
have very small complicacy and the

86
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:16,720
success probability

87
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:19,329
almost 1 ok before showing the attacks

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,419
let me show some practical impact of all

89
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,810
our attacks all these out first of all

90
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:29,139
what should be two rather one of the six

91
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,380
algorithm defined in either and since we

92
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:36,340
announced their attacks in the last year

93
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,889
last autumn in the last year as already

94
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,099
they declared a profile removal from

95
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:46,270
genders okay and the other JavaScript

96
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:49,748
crypto library called sjl which uses OCB

97
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,479
- so instantly usable CBS joshiya may be

98
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:55,270
affected but it is hard to see the real

99
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,248
impact because the use of s this year

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,409
does not necessarily mean the use double

101
00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,749
she be - okay and we understand the

102
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:05,669
fiction crypto is not the easy and time

103
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:10,330
conscious time-consuming process and

104
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,849
fortunately or unfortunately we don't

105
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,060
find any other significant or er what

106
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,069
the use case beyond that so let me

107
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,719
describe there what should be to here's

108
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,020
a picture and you can see that there

109
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,360
them

110
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,969
these are message Brock's and the deeds

111
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,389
here the ciphertext blocks Nancy's here

112
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:31,569
and target here as you can see there

113
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:34,060
it's like ECB mode of operation however

114
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,270
the other masks are prior to the input

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,849
and output of the block cipher brother l

116
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:45,279
ensure value of the mask is derived from

117
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:45,669
as an encryption nos d2l means and a

118
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,219
field

119
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:52,349
gaurav here the multiplication by X and

120
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:54,879
the three-year means a to L plus L and

121
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:57,099
different from the other blocks the only

122
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,500
does last for the last block we did

123
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,050
something different by using a counter

124
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,909
model like encryption taking the rocks a

125
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,710
crying input being the lengthy

126
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:09,699
information of the last block and the

127
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:13,299
other no output mask here and instead of

128
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,819
having a dedicated map function or CB to

129
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,669
computer checksum which is essentially

130
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,500
the sum of all message blocks and the

131
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,849
encryption of the this check sum with

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,020
special mask bar you produced a tag you

133
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,438
can notice that an attack may be

134
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,500
truncate to some Talbot's

135
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,419
and if associate data is present we

136
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,819
first compute a team at fight

137
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:40,120
prep in mark is a parallelizable macro

138
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,689
mode of operation and the result will be

139
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,000
sure to the T here to form the final but

140
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,909
this is the only if the ad is non empty

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,219
in case it is empty we do nothing so

142
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,080
here the picture is yeah just like this

143
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:54,479
one

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,030
and the for simplicity we assume the on

145
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:02,758
truncated tug and empty ad for most

146
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:05,580
cases okay let me move to the forgery

147
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,870
attack its description is quite simple

148
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,849
yeah rudimentary simple

149
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,370
so we first take another arbitrary now

150
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:15,180
sign here and protects the am here to be

151
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,069
encrypted M consists of two blocks the

152
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,539
first block is that a lengthy

153
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:25,379
information of the setting and bit

154
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:27,360
string and m2 is arbitrary and we by

155
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,460
encrypting it will receive the cui the

156
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,330
c2 and the T here from the encryption

157
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,940
righto T will not be used who are tax so

158
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,310
you just remember that memorize that

159
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,690
Anna she won the future are expressed

160
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:45,289
with these formulas okay so this

161
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,389
immediate our route to create a forgery

162
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:52,020
by using the same nouns T here announced

163
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:55,800
here and forge a ciphertext C Prime and

164
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,680
for the air for Gentile T prime here she

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,770
prime is just one block consisting of

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,960
the sum of C 1 and length information

167
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,960
the T prime with the sum of a C 2 plus M

168
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,190
2 then there's only one block so the

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,229
decryption is essentially a counter more

170
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,680
the decryption so C prime is here and

171
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,440
because it is an ax bit we see a cancel

172
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,279
here with this block blue line and this

173
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,610
group encryption part encryption block

174
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,659
type output so we see the decryption

175
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,279
will return to our Plus legacy formation

176
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:35,399
because it is one they are the one block

177
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,880
it's also used as an a checksum here and

178
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:42,208
we note that this special mask for tag

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,630
generation 2 times 3 times L is equal to

180
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:48,630
the 4 L plus 2 L so we see a counter

181
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,160
again here this bar total result is here

182
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,620
which is an encryption of the whole

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,610
block length information which is

184
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:01,620
exactly the same as T prime so we get

185
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:04,310
the accepted this with probability 1

186
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,050
okay

187
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,150
this attack can be extended to along a

188
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,089
message there the idea is essentially to

189
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,529
craft their own leader for arbitrary

190
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:17,240
wrong message we just crafted l-last to

191
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,960
ciphertext blocks and the idea is pretty

192
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,360
yeah the same so I'm skipping it and

193
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,779
this attack is also extended to break

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,529
the confidentiality then at the real bot

195
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:34,550
notion here as a privacy CCA whose goal

196
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,630
is an distinguishing the parable

197
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,029
encryption the decryption

198
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,850
wako from the pair will random

199
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:43,700
encryption and what should be to

200
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,560
decryption of course we have to add

201
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,700
water is not a road to make a tree beer

202
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,680
credits to win then attack is simple we

203
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,760
just mount and minimal forgery and see

204
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,430
if this is accepted okay as we have seen

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,500
that in the left of world case the this

206
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,810
will be accepted with probability 1 what

207
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,920
are the only a negligible probability to

208
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,449
we to make a folder to be accepted in

209
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,459
the right world because the encryption

210
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:14,990
is just a London just returning the

211
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,420
London borough okay and of course and

212
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,570
the object note that this decryption

213
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,040
worker is in fact not necessary just on

214
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,560
the verification worker just returning

215
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,360
the 1b tomorrow for the returning the

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,989
authenticity of the who input why not

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:34,550
it's just enough for our attack ok so

218
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:40,100
what will happen after the minimum

219
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:42,020
forgery then as mentioned other words we

220
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,540
received in prime which is as some of

221
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,430
the tool plus links information and the

222
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,329
tools just it's just a multiplication

223
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:55,130
with coil with a constant so L will be

224
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:58,040
learned so this will also leave visible

225
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,810
boy the rock cycle input out to peers in

226
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,709
addition to that this NL

227
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,109
ok and in the end we get on a low block

228
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:09,949
cipher encrypt Roxas and this will be a

229
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,540
lower more powerful attack ok so let me

230
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,250
move to the description that Universal

231
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,010
forgery the attack consists of two

232
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,770
procedures there are first sample

233
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,260
is to correct a set of random input

234
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,939
output pairs of a block cipher by just

235
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,780
using the minimal forgery with the

236
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:32,500
sample set of random nouns and the other

237
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:37,390
routine in cipher obtains rocks are

238
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:41,320
input-output pairs x 1 y 1 2 X my M

239
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,410
whose arbitrary chosen X I so these are

240
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,240
Lawson and to mountain low block cipher

241
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:52,180
access this is the possible by picking

242
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,650
some known I appeared from the leads out

243
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,319
of some prepared and the using we

244
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,500
thousand am an ass and a pair of now

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,680
said mask because NASA mask a

246
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,140
corresponding mask is known we just pick

247
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,180
a X I arbitrary here and observe the two

248
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,640
il to get an a corresponding plaintext

249
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,300
message here and from the decryption

250
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:17,470
encryption raka we learn the CI here so

251
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,770
we learned why I here okay also the

252
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,440
returns he'll abuse y one y sequence

253
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,870
okay so the goal of the universal

254
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,630
forgery is to simulate OCB to encryption

255
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,970
work Oh so we first set an arbiter

256
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,520
target and there are Odawa observer here

257
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,280
and call sample pairs and the core in

258
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,000
cipher to determine all we put out two

259
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,560
pairs of a block cipher that will happen

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,560
encrypting this target body with the OTP

261
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,989
to encryption and we will learn the seed

262
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,119
error here and the resulting in the row

263
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,550
adora see there are P Dora will be

264
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,840
accepted as buried and it will return

265
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,939
names in Deraa

266
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:00,070
which means that Ana success of the new

267
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,820
bus or forgery and as I'm after

268
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,610
activation data this third step needs

269
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,710
much boolean type of course because the

270
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,830
reason can be obvious from this picture

271
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,080
so the lower part shows the PMAC

272
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,200
paralyze of mac mode for in case of the

273
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,020
ad present and the upper part here is

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,390
the Oh Shiva to encryption so we need

275
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,430
first we first need to determine the

276
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,310
this mask out to burials using the

277
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:31,479
fasting cybercorps feature determine the

278
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:33,849
input to the deep blue boxes then we

279
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,269
learned from the output of the secondary

280
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,220
in cybercorps to date it enough to

281
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,220
determine the input to the dis green box

282
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,810
so in the end of the three and cypher

283
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,389
course are shown to be sufficient for

284
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:50,619
any target to mount a universal forgery

285
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:53,709
okay okay then we moved through the

286
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,690
applying text to recovery the attack

287
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:58,510
mode is here something similar to the

288
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:02,410
attack against the ANSI standard de mon

289
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:05,829
coeur de X Prime so first other words we

290
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:09,209
had some endurance Tourister sister

291
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:12,489
sister at an encryption unknown stir and

292
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:14,529
add worry Edward wreak an access to both

293
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,779
encryption on the decryption Oracle but

294
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,060
nonsense that can not be great to

295
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,779
encryption worker because it has been

296
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,489
used and not must be respected of course

297
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,240
there are trivial decryption query is

298
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:32,560
not our old we did restriction the

299
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,100
Gauri's to recover m stir okay the

300
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,399
attack idea is to swap the broke of a

301
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,079
sister to create some friction or so

302
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,829
that the decryption sideral with

303
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,410
nonsense to really build a master how

304
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:50,680
this is possible

305
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,350
okay here's the target ciphertext sister

306
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,569
here insta here and we first recovered L

307
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,139
star using the sample period and a

308
00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:00,029
cipher as I explained in universal

309
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:05,670
forgery

310
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:08,350
then we tick certain J's and case

311
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,920
ciphertext Bob rocks and the sword with

312
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:16,810
some nasty are use as we already learned

313
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,479
Elster and swap them and decrypt it then

314
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,969
because of the masca counselled though

315
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,100
we see the swap of the block cipher in

316
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,230
put as well how these brokers were just

317
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:31,110
swapped so it will desert in the DD

318
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:36,519
print text Bronx JSON the case bro okay

319
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:39,819
because these offset here and to some of

320
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,709
the masks are equal they will be counted

321
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:45,610
in computing the checksum so this means

322
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:47,619
that these orange blocks

323
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,770
share the same input means the share the

324
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,440
same output that means that on a weekend

325
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,120
the decryption will be accepted we will

326
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,700
then we learn that these print text

327
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,170
blocks as we already knew that stir this

328
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,600
will mean the recovery of M star that's

329
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,099
a goal so this attack with almost

330
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,930
priority one well there are some

331
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,090
negligible we are bad events here but

332
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,489
it's just negligible okay

333
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,980
and then this other can be accepted to

334
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,890
some yeah directions and buttons keeping

335
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,290
here so in the remaining I would like to

336
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,680
describe how this happened who was it -

337
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,810
who are scheme or provable security of

338
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,229
course they are the flaw in the proof

339
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,750
yeah otherwise yeah this is not possible

340
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,580
so to understand this it's important to

341
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,500
understand that that all should be to

342
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:40,240
conscious over to tweakable block cipher

343
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,910
code called XE X and X see both using

344
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,150
the mask two times I said to mrs. J

345
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,750
times L as a function of a tweak in IJ

346
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:52,569
here and the XCX apprised mask for both

347
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,230
sides who are the how to achieve the CCA

348
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,800
security

349
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:00,880
well the XE applied the mask 0:02 only

350
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,969
the input the side okay for achieving

351
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,010
the F XI and these two modes are

352
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,579
combined by now introducing additional

353
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,829
bit of cheek called tag be here and be

354
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,310
Cobra means the use of the XE X and the

355
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,560
beaker zero means the use of the XE and

356
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:22,659
this combined mode is called a target eb

357
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,790
c XE extre okay and the definition is

358
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,790
here former definition is here and the

359
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:32,350
hole and showing the security of XE

360
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:34,810
exter rollaways paper the toggle

361
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,689
expecting of the buzzer is defined who

362
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:40,149
is an advisory and just forwarded these

363
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,250
are two conditions first the no

364
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,200
decryption query it's possible and B

365
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,240
core 0 because that means that the XE

366
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,590
cannot be accessed from the backward

367
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,410
direction and once a query with tweak of

368
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,929
BB T is made then never query the

369
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,270
complement to be with the same T for any

370
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:02,720
T and the ratio that XCX

371
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,580
Tereza Security BC against any yeah

372
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,200
computational restricted toggle

373
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:12,169
expecting other burglaries okay and we

374
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,740
introduced an intermediate scheme c2c b2

375
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:21,200
which is a century abstraction below c

376
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,760
b2 using the TBC so citrusy b2 so that

377
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,580
then i will she be to using the block

378
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,980
cipher e is a clipper into the citrusy

379
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,929
b2 using the XE a toaster using block

380
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:35,810
cipher e and with this equivalence there

381
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:39,320
we can build an hybrid for adult I did

382
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:41,270
awesome 5000 cb2 and this equation

383
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,419
showed that the security of all CB 2 is

384
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:47,120
essentially bounded by this salmon with

385
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,000
the security of XE a coaster for us the

386
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,699
security of the citizen is to using the

387
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,840
idea rights the tweakable block cipher

388
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:59,150
and Rorick Ram data this hybrid holds

389
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,280
for some Congress picnic advisory that

390
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,580
can simulate a but it turns to be wrong

391
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,850
simply long because as we have seen in

392
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,480
our minimal forgery it cos x DX star

393
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,939
with one tea and the tea for some tea

394
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,400
here that query by or it's a second

395
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,660
access rule hope Douglas peeking out the

396
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,240
bursary okay so that's it the

397
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,730
authenticity game who sees us the abused

398
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:32,060
xx turns out the role in the proof so we

399
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:35,600
have investigated their effect to

400
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,639
creating schemes of our attacks but yeah

401
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,209
this it turns out that our attack is

402
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,100
very specific to OCB to so the other

403
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,930
schemes are safe for example what should

404
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,870
be one or should be three are safe and

405
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:51,440
other related schemes such as oto and

406
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:54,379
OPP are also safe because they do not

407
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:01,670
use XE extra what they use the exist

408
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:05,810
about they are they do not misuse so we

409
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:10,850
can fix OC b 2 in steroids the most

410
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:12,970
obvious one is to apply the XE X instead

411
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:17,179
of X C for the last message block

412
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,340
the resulting skin also b2f it's

413
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,620
probably secure in your paper

414
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,080
the proof is our paper and it is secure

415
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:29,030
because it correctly use those extra

416
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:34,340
there are some other other options for

417
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:37,910
fixing but it means still some truths

418
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,889
yeah of course we can just avoid the

419
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:43,790
using or should be too busted by

420
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:48,530
switching it to the DCM over CB three of

421
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:50,629
course okay to conclude main message is

422
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,050
pretty simple over CB is a totally

423
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,830
broken

424
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,659
and seemingly small for in the proof

425
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:59,770
fled of the surprisingly powerful

426
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,840
attacks and the fortunately

427
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,700
unfortunately I'm not sure but attack is

428
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,830
very specific so not applicable to our

429
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,090
CP wide or should be sweet and I've

430
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,070
learned mentioned that the stress that

431
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:15,320
and a general structure was she be sleep

432
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,720
sound insecure what resin runs you so

433
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,800
simple even the most promising spew can

434
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,720
fail so creepy tree is hard okay and

435
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,050
every detail proof is very important for

436
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,390
assuring the whole security and activity

437
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,690
protein purification is important of

438
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,730
course proof verification for approval

439
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:40,220
security scheme is a usual little

440
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:43,930
rewarding but this time as a barre okay

441
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,930
that is Sansui attention

442
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:19,530
any questions you'll have to come to the

443
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:22,350
microphones near the stage please yeah

444
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,530
we we first found the gap in the proof

445
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,600
then we try to fit yeah we first believe

446
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,530
that what should be to secure Indian so

447
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,780
we try to put the proof pattern but

448
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:41,370
eventually we found or she be - yeah

449
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:43,430
insecure and that data story any other

450
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,360
questions

451
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:50,940
okay let's thank the speaker again

452
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,939
[Applause]
