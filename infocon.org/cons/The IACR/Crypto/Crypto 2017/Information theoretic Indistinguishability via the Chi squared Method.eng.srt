1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:07,250
hi good morning and thanks for being

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,200
here so late in the conference so yeah

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,299
this is joint work with way from UCSD

4
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:14,809
and Tim from Florida State and this talk

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,369
is about in distinguishability and the

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,199
starting point is the fact that proving

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,020
indistinguishability is a central step

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,150
in assessing the security of symmetric

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,520
cryptography and in fact very often we

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,470
end up with fairly sophisticated proofs

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,000
which are made of complex and

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,619
error-prone probabilistic argument

13
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,110
arguments and for this reason several

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,390
frameworks have been developed over the

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,670
years to ease this task and make it

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,920
easier for us still there's a number of

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,809
very hard technical questions that

18
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,550
remain open and for which we have no

19
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,920
solutions and so the main purpose of

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,839
this work was to come up with new

21
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,550
techniques to enhance the set of results

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,109
we can cover and for which we can prove

23
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,190
in distinguishability

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,679
and in particular we have two

25
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,479
contributions the first one is a new

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,010
framework which we call the chi-square

27
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,109
method for indistinguishability proofs

28
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,089
which is then applied to a number of

29
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,309
constructions that we analyzed for which

30
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,049
we obtained not only simpler proofs but

31
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,720
often tighter bounds and for time

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,490
reasons in this talk I'm going to focus

33
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,770
off on one of this construction which is

34
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,409
the excerpts with a random permutation

35
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,729
it's a very simple construction which

36
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,950
has eluded a simple analysis for almost

37
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,869
two decades to date and hence it's a

38
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,840
great test bed for our framework so for

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,259
this reason I want to start this talk by

40
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,549
giving you an overview of this

41
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,869
construction and the problem it solves

42
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,640
because before moving to our actual

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,100
contributions so the problem you are

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,140
considering is the one of building good

45
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,630
pseudo-random functions or prfs so

46
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,579
remember that this object is just a

47
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,320
function which takes additional a secret

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,189
key and if this key is chosen randomly

49
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,780
no adversary usually call the

50
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,490
distinguisher can tell apart an

51
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,499
interaction with the keyed function from

52
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:52,909
an interaction with a truly random

53
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,979
function which returns uniform random

54
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,130
outputs and this indistinguishability is

55
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,259
formalized by having the distinguisher

56
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,630
output a decision bit and then we

57
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,670
capture its distinguishing advantage or

58
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,710
PRF advantage which is the difference

59
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,479
between the probabilities that the

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,310
distinguisher output 1 in each of the

61
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,560
two experiments and generally we are

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,510
interested in the best possible such

63
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,730
advantage given a certain distinguished

64
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,830
running time T and a budget of queries

65
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,900
you and we will like of course for F to

66
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,150
be a good PRF needs to be as small as

67
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,250
possible for T and Q as large as

68
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,910
possible

69
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,880
a related notion is that of a pseudo

70
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,250
random permutations or PRP and it's

71
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,900
better tailor that block ciphers like

72
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,140
AES so here the context is that our

73
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,090
function our keyed function is a

74
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,160
permutation for each value of the key so

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,410
it's one-to-one and has no collisions in

76
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,470
the outputs so it's fair here to really

77
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,450
require indistinguishability from a

78
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,970
random permutation which returns outputs

79
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,290
that are random but are all have or

80
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,540
distinct and of course one can formalize

81
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,610
this again in terms of corresponding PRP

82
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,100
distinguishing advantage so again the

83
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,870
important point here is that from a

84
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,459
practical standpoint what we want are

85
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,830
good PRF because these are great tools

86
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,780
that allow us to achieve a lot of

87
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,340
applications for encryption and

88
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,410
authentication and so on but what we

89
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,290
typically have are good PRPs in the form

90
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,030
of block ciphers like a yes that are

91
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,709
satisfied there are assumed to satisfy

92
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,959
this property in a strong sense and the

93
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,730
catch with it is that a block cipher can

94
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,950
never be a good PRF if the number of

95
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,660
queries exceed the square root of the

96
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,550
domain size and this is just by the

97
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,200
birthday bound beyond the number of

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
queries you will notice the lack of

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,170
collisions and hence you can distinguish

100
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,150
from a random function so it's totally

101
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,970
conceivable to have regimes for

102
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,220
adversarial complexity where AES is a

103
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,260
good PRP however it's a completely

104
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,230
insecure PRF so a question that was

105
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,870
asked for the first time by two very

106
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,459
close works time close timely close

107
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,140
works by bellari Kravitz and rot away

108
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,690
and how vogner calcium schneider in 98

109
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,850
is whether one can find transformations

110
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,920
that transform PRP syncope RS while

111
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
preserving security and a very neat

112
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,820
constructions that was first suggested

113
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,590
by Bill are at all in their paper

114
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,320
without a proof is the XOR of PR peas

115
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,410
so the idea here is that we obtain a PRF

116
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,780
which depends on the key of the PRF our

117
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,090
two block cipher keys and to evaluate it

118
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,370
on input X we evaluate the block cipher

119
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,320
on the two keys on the same input X and

120
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,630
X or the outputs I refer to this

121
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,760
construction in the following as XOR to

122
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,529
because of its two key nature

123
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,630
you can easily obtain a one key version

124
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,630
of this construction by losing one bit

125
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,150
of input lag and prepending a 0 a 1 to

126
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,800
the input and invoking the block cipher

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
on the same on these two

128
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,950
inputs and XOR in the output I will call

129
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,310
this one the XOR construction now these

130
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,320
starting these constructions is far from

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,390
just purely theoretical interest so

132
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,250
there are practical schemes that are

133
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,810
meant to achieve beyond very secure

134
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,360
security that rely on it and in fact

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,350
very recently

136
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,910
Avada and Saran have proposed a

137
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,710
modification of the GCMs IV

138
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,740
authentication encryption scheme that

139
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,510
relies on the construction for more

140
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,990
secure key derivation from denounces so

141
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,670
it's important for this reason to have

142
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,520
good bounds on the PRF security of the

143
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,010
XOR to any extra construction and the

144
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,260
way we approach proving something like

145
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,660
this a bound on the PRF security is

146
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,210
typically by transitioning to a simpler

147
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,640
to handle intermediate world where we

148
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,860
replace the block cipher instances with

149
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,320
independent randomly chosen permutations

150
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,350
it's easy to bound the distance between

151
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,630
the two left worlds just by the PRP

152
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,490
advantage of the underlying block cipher

153
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,800
which is usually very small and then the

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,290
problem is to find a bound this thing

155
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,850
for distinguishing the two right hand

156
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,880
side worlds and combining the two bounds

157
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,770
we can get a bound for the PRF security

158
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,140
and so we typically focus on upper

159
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,120
bounding this term which is the really

160
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,490
hard problem where we have this idolized

161
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,740
version of the extra two construction or

162
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,510
respectively the extra construction and

163
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,520
giving such bounds typically it's a

164
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,170
purely information theoretic problem we

165
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,050
don't really know how to exploit

166
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,070
computational bounds on the power of the

167
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,110
distinguisher we typically only exploit

168
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,510
the number of queries it makes so there

169
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,670
has been work and technically very

170
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,620
involved work on analyzing this quantity

171
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,570
and analyzing these constructions the

172
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,700
first search result was by molarity in

173
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,270
paliotta who publish in 1999 an

174
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,530
impoverished manuscript that gave a

175
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,780
bound that essentially implies security

176
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,690
up to almost 2 to the N queries

177
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,710
unfortunately this paper has some minor

178
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,540
errors that by now we know how to fix

179
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,820
but remain unpublished and looks one

180
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,350
year later published actually a bound

181
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,750
which is inferior for the extra and

182
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,580
extra for the Tukey version of the

183
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,260
construction and only guarantees

184
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,850
security up to 2 to the N over three

185
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,420
queries so it was up to Ollie until 2008

186
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,580
in 2010 that pattern published to

187
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,490
analysis of the two variants of the

188
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,900
construction which essentially give

189
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,620
optimal

190
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,260
security or near optimal security and in

191
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,389
this work we actually give very similar

192
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:53,510
bands to patterns and the point however

193
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,810
and why this is important is because

194
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,850
patterns bounds follow by applying a

195
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,460
very heavy hammer that bark is going to

196
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,139
talk about in his talk later on called

197
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,120
mirror theory and here results are

198
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,530
proofs that are very involved they

199
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,949
exceed 50 pages in length and I think at

200
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,690
least the second one is probably not yet

201
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,150
probably not fully verified today so in

202
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,100
contrast our proof follows as a much

203
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,810
simpler application of our chi-square

204
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,630
method and while for the one key version

205
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,630
we pretty much machen get us only

206
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,280
slightly weaker bound and patterns which

207
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
is tight for the two key version we get

208
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
a much superior bound where we have an

209
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,180
exponent higher than one which gives us

210
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,360
a force much smaller advantage for query

211
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,419
regimes that are smaller than 2 to the N

212
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,220
so I want to give you an overview now

213
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,470
how the chi-square method works and what

214
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,130
it does and to do so we have to look at

215
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,740
the general problem of a distinguisher

216
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,139
that attempts to tell apart two

217
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,660
interactive objects or systems F and G

218
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,510
by making queries to them and we want to

219
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,849
upper bound its distinguishing advantage

220
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,410
in doing so now it is convenient to look

221
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,870
more closely at how an interaction

222
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,610
between the distinguisher and the system

223
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,300
looks like

224
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,340
so the distinguisher will proceed by

225
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,870
making queries and receiving

226
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,210
corresponding answers from the system f

227
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,220
and make a certain bound and number of

228
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,380
them say Q before outputting its

229
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,349
decision bit now a neat thing is that

230
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,900
for information theoretic analysis we

231
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,070
can usually assume that the

232
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,300
distinguisher is without loss of

233
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,580
generality deterministic meaning it

234
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,190
doesn't make any random choices and this

235
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,110
allow us to describe the interaction

236
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,659
uniquely by just looking at the answers

237
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,279
of the queries because if the

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,809
distinguisher is deterministic you can

239
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,339
reconstruct the queries themselves

240
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,589
uniquely from their answers okay they're

241
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,779
always uniquely determined so I'm going

242
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,060
to denote the sequence of outputs

243
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,440
obtained from the system by the

244
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,320
distinguished D which we now fix as the

245
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,720
transcript y superscript F of course you

246
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,459
can do the same for the system G and

247
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,079
you're going to obtain a corresponding

248
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,949
transcript as Y superscript

249
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,329
now here is the point why we want to

250
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,910
look at transcripts so what we know from

251
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,320
previous works already is a simple

252
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,910
observation is that if you want to upper

253
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,649
bound the distinguishing advantage of D

254
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,870
you can do so by the statistical

255
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,180
distance of the transcripts in fact this

256
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,589
bound is tight if the distinguished

257
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,259
oozes its bid optimally and so here's

258
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,839
the Cystic a distance is just 1/2 the l1

259
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,009
distance between the probability

260
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,110
distributions and this observation has

261
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,610
been exploiting numerous frameworks for

262
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,079
indistinguishability proofs in

263
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,500
particular in the H coefficient method

264
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,180
here however we focus on a specific

265
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,430
class of proofs which I call next output

266
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,220
indistinguishability probes so what that

267
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,529
means is that we consider settings where

268
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,660
the distinguisher has performed a

269
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,550
partial interaction say with the system

270
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,850
F as observed y- i outputs y or y will

271
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,819
be equal 3 and now given its observation

272
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,470
there is a well-defined probability

273
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,569
distribution for the i'd output the

274
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,269
output to the i'd query and we want to

275
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,279
compare this next output probability

276
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,500
distribution with the one we will get if

277
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,910
you were actually interacting with the

278
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,889
system G and we had seen the same

279
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,920
partial set of outputs so far and by

280
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,899
comparing typically we will try for

281
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,000
example to understand an upper bound a

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,829
statistical distance between these next

283
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,319
output distributions if you can do that

284
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,389
then every cryptographer will probably

285
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,100
almost instantaneously then try to apply

286
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,440
a hybrid argument to upper bound over

287
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,019
all statistical distance by summing up

288
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,910
this next output statistical distances

289
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,649
so this is more of a probabilistic

290
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,420
version of how you will state a hybrid

291
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,190
argument you have to be careful this

292
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,620
next output distances depend on the

293
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,149
sequence of previous outputs so there

294
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,670
are random variables and therefore you

295
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,199
will need to take an expectation here

296
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,060
when you're summing up but it's really

297
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,069
the usual hybrid argument and one of the

298
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,860
problems with this is that these are

299
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,240
mean arguments are known not to be tight

300
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,120
in general and for this reason here we

301
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,949
suggest a different approach which is

302
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:53,720
inspired by similar phenomena that have

303
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,699
been observed in statistics where

304
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:57,620
instead of upper bounding the next

305
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,699
output statistical distances we upper

306
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:04,130
bound the chi-square divergence of the

307
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,560
next output distributions you don't need

308
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
to understand chi-square diverges in

309
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,680
detail beyond the fact that it's some

310
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
sort of weighted version of l2 distance

311
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,250
which is a symmetric

312
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,170
the weights depend on one of the two

313
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,900
probability distributions but the key

314
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,880
point is that when you do that we can

315
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,560
actually give an alternative version of

316
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,330
the hybrid argument which is what we

317
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,520
refer to as the chi-square method which

318
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,590
essentially upper-bound a statistical

319
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,300
distance with the square root of the sum

320
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,370
of the expected chi-square divergences

321
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,180
over the number of queries okay so it's

322
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,470
very similar but you have a square root

323
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,910
now of course I might be treating you

324
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,710
here I mean this is just a different

325
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,360
formula you don't have any sense out

326
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,310
circle distance relates to chi-square

327
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,980
you know are we getting anything new and

328
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,810
I want to give you one abstract examples

329
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,490
before turning to a more concrete one

330
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,340
assume for example that we can show that

331
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,870
the next output probability

332
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,610
distributions are very close in a point

333
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,820
wise sense for example for every Y for

334
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,800
every partial sequence of outputs you

335
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,090
know that the probability that the next

336
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,580
output in Y at the ratio between the

337
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,320
probability that the next output is y in

338
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,880
F and the probability that the next

339
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,640
output is y in G is very close to one is

340
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,360
within epsilon in ratio now if we do the

341
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,520
standard ibrid argument and you want to

342
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,950
compute the statistical distance between

343
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,980
the next output distributions given this

344
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,780
information only you have to trust me

345
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,730
it's a very simple calculation all you

346
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,500
get is an upper bound of epsilon over to

347
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,870
put this into the hybrid argument you're

348
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,070
going to get something that grows

349
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,020
linearly in the number of queries

350
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,839
once you pick up the exception if you

351
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,400
actually apply the chi-square method

352
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,290
then if you compute the chi-square

353
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,000
divergence given the same information

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,910
again leave the calculation you have to

355
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,710
trust me here you get epsilon square as

356
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,870
an upper bound much smaller and if you

357
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,670
apply the refine hybrid arguments now

358
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,080
you get something which grows with the

359
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,330
square root of Q rather than Q as you

360
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,900
gets large this is a huge improvement

361
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,339
now I want to show you more concretely

362
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,540
how this a chi-square method applies to

363
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,390
analyzing the XOR construction in

364
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,030
particular I want to look at the XOR to

365
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,920
construction again it's easier to

366
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,690
analyze in the paper we also have done

367
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,310
analysis for the single key version as I

368
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,490
will say shortly and what that means is

369
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,220
that we are considering now our real

370
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,810
system to be the construction

371
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,880
accentuated with two independent random

372
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,300
permutations where as our system G is

373
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,130
to be a truly random function now if you

374
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,650
want to apply the method what we need to

375
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,080
do now is try to understand this next

376
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,870
output probability distributions so we

377
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,700
imagine that we around the execution for

378
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,620
a while there's some fixed distinguish

379
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,050
distinguisher it's implicit here making

380
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,970
some queries it has made I minus 1

381
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,490
queries and we have obtained iemon we

382
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,570
have obtained the first I minus 1

383
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,490
outputs this is this boldface why I

384
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,770
minus 1 vector and now we want to

385
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,660
understand what's the probability that

386
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,970
the output to the next query the I'd

387
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,610
query here again I is equal for equals

388
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,880
small Y of course this is a complicated

389
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,740
distribution we will need to understand

390
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,690
but the distribution is easy to

391
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,400
understand in the case we were actually

392
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,570
interacting with the random function

393
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,600
there the probability will be uniform so

394
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,630
it's 1 over 2 to the N so this allows it

395
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,970
at least to put into place a formula for

396
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,590
the chi-square divergence we are going

397
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,550
to upper bound for every I and our goal

398
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,250
is to Bonnie's expectation and we can in

399
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,930
fact here nicely exploit the linearity

400
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,390
of expectation and the problem is

401
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,340
equivalent to upper bounding the

402
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,620
individual Salmons in the sum over all

403
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,170
outputs Y so we can fix an output Y any

404
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,150
possible string and upper bound that

405
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,960
term for any Y so an important point

406
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,820
here again I want to stress it again

407
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,260
this probability is quite hard to

408
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,850
understand and it's the core of the

409
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,220
proof but a neat observation that was

410
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,540
already pointed out in the work by

411
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,390
bellari dimple yatza is that it's easier

412
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,850
to deal with this probability if rather

413
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,590
than conditioning on the sequence of I

414
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,440
minus 1 outputs which implies a lot of

415
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,630
different things we rather think of

416
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,090
conditioning on the internal values that

417
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,830
have been output by the two permutations

418
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,800
call them u y2 UI minus 1 and we want to

419
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,020
be Y minus 1 if you're actually

420
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,360
conditioned on those then it turns out

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,740
that it's much easier to describe the

422
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,270
probability that we reach a particular

423
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,640
output it's not clear you can do that in

424
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,440
fact but a simple application of the

425
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,150
answers inequality tells you that if

426
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,530
you're actually computing the

427
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,380
expectation only of this summons we can

428
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,750
do this by just not making the term

429
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,670
smaller and we will be able to upper

430
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,110
bound the right hand side again with

431
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,670
something small in fact there's a Spiner

432
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,560
error here that was pointed out by Nandi

433
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,100
and

434
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,080
in a version we have in the proceedings

435
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,690
so we are making this in on ePrint where

436
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,130
we are claiming that these are equal

437
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,630
they are not but you can prove easily

438
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,940
this with the instance inequality and so

439
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,580
we are left with the problem of upper

440
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,140
bounding this probability really and

441
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,380
understanding it to upper bound the term

442
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,610
it turns out at this point this is not

443
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,370
very hard in fact what we need to do is

444
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,170
we fix some values of permanence we fix

445
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,940
the values of the permutation output and

446
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,290
we want to understand what's the

447
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,940
probability that the ight where it takes

448
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,360
the value Y and in fact to do this it's

449
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,820
really enough to think how many possible

450
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,430
values the ID output of the first

451
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,880
permutation call it you I can take which

452
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,530
are consistent with the output still

453
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,660
possibly being this fixed Y remember we

454
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,810
fixed Y and we can do that so in

455
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,940
particular if you look at the space of

456
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,830
all possible 2 to the N values we see

457
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,170
that you I can definitely not be equal

458
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,450
you want to UI minus 1 because it's a

459
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,490
permutation so the ID output of the

460
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,220
permutation needs to be distinct also

461
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,020
you have to be careful that there are

462
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,400
some other values you cannot take

463
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,610
because the value of VI such that UI X

464
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,100
or VI equal Y is uniquely determined and

465
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,780
you need to make sure that this is also

466
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,550
consistent with the fact that PI 2 is a

467
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,680
permutation so there's a set of other

468
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,560
values that you I cannot take okay

469
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,940
otherwise you will never reach y

470
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,880
guaranteed and so these are all of them

471
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,590
the two sets these are the ones you

472
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,750
can't have everything else is fine and

473
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,640
if we denote the intersect the size of

474
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,280
the intersection of these two sets by di

475
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,470
y then it turns out you can use

476
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,119
inclusion exclusion and give a very

477
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,589
simple form like that you don't need two

478
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,439
parts of the probability that the value

479
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,720
of y is they can condition on the

480
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,550
internal values and internal outputs of

481
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,520
the permutation so the key point here is

482
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,560
that you have to trust me but these are

483
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,200
all simple calculations and if you plug

484
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,660
the Zeen through some simple algebraic

485
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,550
manipulations and some inequalities and

486
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,320
some working around them you can upper

487
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,420
bound a statistical distance with an

488
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,160
expression which is the square root of a

489
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,040
double sum of variances of these random

490
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,840
variables the iy that I just defined

491
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,700
where again remember that these are

492
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,100
nothing but random variables obtained by

493
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,610
sampling twice independently I minus one

494
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,289
n bit strings without replace

495
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,350
and then shifting them by why one of the

496
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,390
two set by Y and looking at the size of

497
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,789
the intersection in fact it's not our to

498
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,919
see that Y does not even matter once you

499
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,850
do that and you can really set Y to 0

500
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,500
again this is not a hard calculation you

501
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,909
have to work a little bit but something

502
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:12,799
you could ask in a probability class you

503
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,110
can upper bound the variance and you

504
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,580
plugged it in and you get the desired

505
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,799
bound I mean the key point here is that

506
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,500
I omitted a lot of calculations but I

507
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,850
really want to stress that the actual

508
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,529
steps on the proof I haven't cheated are

509
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,210
exactly what I brought here plus some

510
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,820
calculations that require some pain but

511
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,549
can be done pretty easily and if you

512
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:32,990
compare it with existing proofs that's a

513
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,039
massive improvement now going towards

514
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,730
conclusions there are more results we

515
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,149
present in the paper so we as promised

516
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:48,070
we analyzed the single key xor

517
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,500
construction here the analysis is more

518
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,990
painful in particular because you have

519
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,190
to deal with the fact that there's

520
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,740
dependence between you don't have two

521
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,120
independent permutations so there's a

522
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,890
higher degree of dependence and this

523
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,480
makes probability calculations some one

524
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,860
more painful but the high-level

525
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,809
structure of the proof is very similar

526
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,419
to what I have just shown you okay the

527
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,850
bound is weaker and the main reason for

528
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,649
this is actually not even due to our

529
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,510
technique but simply the fact that this

530
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,309
is a construction that can never output

531
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,070
zero and therefore this makes the bound

532
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,309
Q over 2 to the N type another

533
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:23,990
construction that we analyzed in our

534
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,490
work is the encrypted davidsmeier

535
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,679
construction that was proposed by karate

536
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,140
and Saran here at crypto last year and

537
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,169
they proposed a bound up to 2 to the N 2

538
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,539
to the 2n over 3 security we improved

539
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,640
these so to the 3/4 and security by

540
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,529
using the chi-square method and here I

541
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,970
have to say that I have to advertise

542
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,440
that there's going to be a talk later in

543
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,210
this session which is going to go back

544
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,279
to Mirror theory to show a tighter

545
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,320
bounds that implies security up to 2 to

546
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,510
the N for the same construction I also

547
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,039
want to stress that it's not clear

548
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,380
whether we can tighten our analysis

549
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,909
using the chi-square method and it's

550
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,500
still open and we might be able to do so

551
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,559
it's an open problem and finally we also

552
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,350
study the swap or not cipher which is a

553
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,090
construction that was proposed by Hogg

554
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,279
Morrison rockaway in the context of

555
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:07,910
former prison

556
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,010
encryption here the result is a bit

557
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,020
harder to state compactly but

558
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,210
essentially using the chi-square method

559
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,820
we prove better trade-offs between the

560
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,560
round the number of rounds in the cipher

561
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,490
and the achievable security level so I

562
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,960
want to conclude with a big disclaimer

563
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,900
here which is that the techniques that I

564
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,090
have used here from a statistical

565
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,260
viewpoints are really nothing new so

566
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,820
some of these techniques appear in

567
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,490
spurious works and also special cases of

568
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,660
these techniques have used even in

569
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,430
computer science so a notable example is

570
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,870
a paper by Chi Minh Chung and Celine

571
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,580
vidonne from 2008

572
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,930
they're both cryptographers but the

573
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,910
paper is not on cryptography is on

574
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,460
analyzing hashing on block sources which

575
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,530
uses a special case of our framework in

576
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,570
their analysis there is even an older

577
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,300
paper by some not the cryptographer a

578
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,190
statistician who actually proved

579
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,840
something that rephrase in our own

580
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,400
language using the chi-square method

581
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,100
will directly imply good bounds for the

582
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,440
truncated random permutations and giving

583
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,790
bounds but the mean the methods were

584
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,710
somewhat similar or special cases of

585
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,080
what we have but the bottom line here

586
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,970
and I think the lesson that we get out

587
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,500
of this at least with the example of the

588
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,410
XOR of pure piece is that when we have

589
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,820
problems that are really technically

590
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,590
hard sometimes we are stuck on using

591
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,420
frameworks that are well-established to

592
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,610
give these proofs and in many cases

593
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,740
thinking a bit more broadly like maybe

594
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,660
people will do outside cryptography in

595
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,460
statistics using for example other

596
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,620
metrics might help us solve the problem

597
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,020
much more elegantly and much more

598
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,820
compactly and with better bounds also

599
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,070
not an entirely new observation even in

600
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,840
this community there's a notable example

601
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,450
a paper by John Steinberger from 2012

602
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,400
where you use heling your distance to

603
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,050
prove bounds on key alternating cipher

604
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,970
so the fact that we can swap metrics in

605
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,250
our type of proof is also not something

606
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,590
new and there are open questions as I

607
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,840
mentioned before they encrypt that there

608
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,070
is Meyer construction it would be nice

609
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,660
to close the gap with a shorter proof

610
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,390
using the chi-square method another

611
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,700
interesting question is on our two extra

612
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,890
analysis I advertise the fact that

613
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,420
having an exponent larger than one of

614
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,800
course gives us better bounds and a

615
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,780
better decay but it's not clear that the

616
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,330
1.5 exponent is tight and in fact two

617
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,070
might be more like a reasonable answer I

618
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,270
don't know but we don't know how to

619
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,580
prove it and of course finding more

620
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,170
applications is also something very

621
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,930
important ok this is everything I wanted

622
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,860
to say so I

623
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,940
thank you for your attention the paper

624
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,770
is an e print and I'm happy to take your

625
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,850
questions

626
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:31,290
