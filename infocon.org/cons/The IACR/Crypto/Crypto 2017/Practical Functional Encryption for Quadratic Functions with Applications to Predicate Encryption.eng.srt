1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,309
so first let me define functional

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,969
encryption or se suppose Alice wants to

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,840
send some data em to the cloud Bob to

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,580
delegate storage and computation on this

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,580
data but she still wants some privacy on

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,340
her data so she's going to encrypt it in

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,529
such a way that Bob only turns some

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,470
particular function f on M and nothing

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,050
more so you can think of F of a some

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,449
function that computes descriptive

11
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,059
statistics on the encrypted data or some

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,299
SQL query or some such thing

13
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,710
so because Bob only learns this

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,170
particular F of M will have some notion

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,610
of privacy in particular Bob doesn't

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,010
learn the entire message tab so this is

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,780
what we want to achieve and if he allows

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,619
to achieve that using a trusted setup

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,159
that is going to generate a public key

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,150
thanks to which Alice can encrypt the

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,699
message m and a master secret key that

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,239
is used by key generation algorithm that

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,930
can produce different key for different

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,000
functions so SKF is a particular key for

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,010
the particular function f thanks to

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,600
which Bob can extract from the

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,120
encryption of M F of M as I said and

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,640
nothing more and you can think of other

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,030
user cow that wants to compute G of n so

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,100
it will get a different key s key of J

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
of G sorry that allows him to compute G

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,630
of M and to be a bit more precise the

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
security you want is a resistance to a

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,730
collision of secret keys so if an

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,010
adversary gets the public key but also

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,140
different secret keys for the functions

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,390
different functions the adversary should

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,490
not learn anything more than what each

39
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,950
individual key allows him to learn all

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,720
right so here in this case will only

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,430
learn F of M and G of M and nothing more

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,350
cannot combine keys to get extra

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,710
information

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,330
formulas is captured by

45
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,159
indistinguishability base security where

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,440
the adversary

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,479
chooses some pair of message m0 and m1

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,500
and as long as the adversary only gets

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,508
secret keys that do not distinguish

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,610
between these two messages the adversary

51
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,920
will be unable computationally it will

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
be unable for him to

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,920
Singlish between the encryption of m0

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,390
from an encryption of m1 and it's also

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,489
interesting to so usually the adversary

56
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,409
can do everything at adaptively so it

57
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:27,569
first gets a public key and then choose

58
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,370
the message m0 m1 depending on the

59
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,190
public key and the secret engines in

60
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,480
general but you can also consider

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,370
restricted class of adversary that are

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,430
called selective because these adversary

63
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,120
or choose m0 and m1 before seeing the

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,799
public key so independently of

65
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,579
everything that will be useful later so

66
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,989
this is the weaker notion of adaptive

67
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,780
security all right so now what do we

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,810
know how to do for EFI so that was some

69
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,940
general feasibility result for all

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,180
circuit they are based on strong

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,680
assumptions namely

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,420
indistinguishability of the schedule for

73
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,019
circuits and on the other hand there are

74
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,379
some work who tried to build EFI from

75
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,540
standard assumption much weaker such as

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,239
zdh they do so for restrictive classes

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,269
of function so this is the case of a PDP

78
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,239
we built a functional encryption for ddh

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,900
for these particular places of function

80
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,519
in a product where the message is a

81
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,819
vector and the function is also vector

82
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,609
of sign same dimension and the function

83
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,200
applied on M gives you the inner product

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,579
and not in one and so in part it so you

85
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,099
could do you can compute weighted sum on

86
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,620
encrypted data places and the cipher

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,209
text size is linear it's a number of

88
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,950
group elements that is linear in the

89
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,040
dimension n so following is more

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,859
bottom-up approach we try to build from

91
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,829
standard assumption and he for slightly

92
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,049
richer class of function so what we did

93
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,799
was to build a fee for quadratic

94
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,049
functions essentially so the message now

95
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,040
is a pair of vector m NX x and y two

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,980
vectors and the function is a linear map

97
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,169
so f of them will give you x times f x y

98
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,250
and the important thing is that the

99
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,910
cipher text size is linear in n plus m

100
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,130
all right so we do so using standard

101
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,990
assumption based on

102
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,539
Mehring so this is important that the

103
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,660
size is a linear in the n plus n because

104
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,039
as you can see you can already do

105
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,319
quadratic function from inner product by

106
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,139
simply expressing a billionaire maps has

107
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,729
a huge vector but that would blow up the

108
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,940
size to n times M so this is really

109
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,729
about efficiency improvement here yeah I

110
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,660
was saying that there are some

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,099
independent work that also build quality

112
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,979
people quality functions there was the

113
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,060
work and on Sahai and lean there was the

114
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,710
main difference with these works and our

115
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,810
work is that they are private key and we

116
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,710
are public key but to be fair they also

117
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,419
actually some slightly stronger notion

118
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,849
where the secret key heights of the

119
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,440
underlying function and it's not

120
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,810
achievable in public key part so this is

121
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,580
incomparable set of result and also

122
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,009
these papers do much more than just

123
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,039
building a quadratic Fe and so actually

124
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,889
we have two constructions so let's look

125
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,930
at the assumption so the Ananta hi is

126
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,400
based on hard rock assumption just

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,180
defining the generic group model whereas

128
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,389
lean is based on standard assumption sx

129
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,090
d h so paring and we build two

130
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,250
constriction one is from standard

131
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,139
assumption and the other is based on

132
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,530
generic group model but first of all

133
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,120
this is more efficient this one is more

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,090
if asymptotically more efficient and

135
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,979
also it satisfies a stronger notion of

136
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,449
security so at the beginning I mentioned

137
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,729
that you can also think of a restricted

138
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,130
security selective security so this is

139
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,569
the case of all this construction they

140
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,750
are only selectively secure and this one

141
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,430
this is one based on the general group

142
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,889
model is adaptively secures which is

143
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,340
security you want in the end okay so for

144
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,050
this thought I'm mostly going to talk

145
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,569
about this construction the reason being

146
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,819
that proof in the general group model

147
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,680
tend to be less intuitive so I'm more

148
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,560
going to focus on this one all right and

149
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,569
also one contribution of our paper is

150
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,000
some application to predicate encryption

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,889
what is predicated creep shell it's a

152
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,539
particular case of functional encryption

153
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,699
where the messages contains two things

154
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,690
the plaintext and an attribute which is

155
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,150
as before X of a pair of vector X and

156
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,889
why

157
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,110
now the function on of em will be output

158
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,960
the plaintext if the villain armed up a

159
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,749
variation evaluates to the video map

160
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,930
evaluates to zero and nothing else so

161
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,279
nothing is revealed about the plaintext

162
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,439
if this is not 0 alright so this is a

163
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,810
pretty key encryption fully hiding

164
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,699
predicating encryption to be precise and

165
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,860
what we do is build this thing with

166
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,930
cipher text size again linear in n plus

167
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,460
M versus preview prior box which will

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,499
when we so you could obtain n times n

169
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,110
which prayer works all right but I'm not

170
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,669
going to talk about this predicating

171
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,259
gription i'm only going to talk about

172
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,599
functional encryption for this talk for

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
the rest of this talk alright so this is

174
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,830
roughly the high-level view of our

175
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,379
construction we want to build a fee for

176
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,719
this function here that takes a pair of

177
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,770
vector and outputs

178
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,639
x times f x y right the idea is to

179
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,360
encrypt X the pair of master vector x

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,819
and y by first encrypting X and

181
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,969
independently encrypting Y with linear

182
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,349
size encryption and we want to combine

183
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,719
these two encryption here in a way that

184
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,180
depends on F to obtain an encryption of

185
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,819
f of X Y and there's some public key

186
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,279
which also it depend on F and this thing

187
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,849
here should be a decrypted wall only if

188
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,759
you know the secret key of F s K of F

189
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,310
and nothing else otherwise nothing

190
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,399
should be revealed about F X Y the way

191
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,949
we do this is using a pairing a be

192
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,689
linear maps that takes group element

193
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,419
from some source group which is

194
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,270
generated by little G so you can pair a

195
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,729
group element G little G to G a with

196
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,229
another group element little G to the B

197
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,449
to obtain in the target group some e

198
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,639
paired with g and g and the

199
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,229
multiplication in the exponent so you

200
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,460
can do one multiplication

201
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,919
alright so will we use that to combine

202
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,779
things from here with things from here

203
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,729
to obtain an encryption in the target

204
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,299
group alright that's roughly the idea

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,159
now I'll go more into details I will do

206
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,740
so in three steps first I'll give you a

207
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,539
private key Fe that's a little bit

208
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,100
simpler and that we

209
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,220
well that will be simplified and it's

210
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,960
only going to be secured in a generic

211
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,790
group model and it's not yeah so is it

212
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,820
simplicity and then I'll show you how to

213
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,500
get from private key to public key but

214
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,140
also still a scheme that is too simple

215
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,640
to be proven secure understand and

216
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,890
assumption just to give you some

217
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,570
intuition and finally I'll show you some

218
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,400
briefly some of the techniques we use to

219
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,680
get actually security from standard

220
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,510
assumption all right so first let's let

221
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,240
me go then to describe the private key

222
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,690
Fe so as I said we'll use the pairing

223
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,240
and I'm going to introduce some notation

224
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,910
so yes so these are all prime other

225
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,420
groups in our case and the notation I'm

226
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,760
going to use is I'm gonna write bracket

227
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,180
a for any exponent a over the NDP to

228
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,400
denote G little G to the a you can

229
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
generalize this notation from vectors

230
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,390
and so on and - so what is the master

231
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,710
secret key is just a bunch of random

232
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,680
group elements one for each index I and

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
J that's it the encryption takes a pair

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,460
of vector x and Y is going to compute a

235
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,420
bunch of row vector which are X I

236
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,610
catenate it with the randomness our eyes

237
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,050
that comes from the master secret key

238
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,590
times a random invertible 2x2 matrix w

239
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,690
that's picked freshly at random at each

240
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,810
encryption and there is also a bunch of

241
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,290
column vector which are as you can read

242
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,980
W minus 1 the inverse of W and

243
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,240
multiplied by the vector y j SJ so

244
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,020
that's that's all the cipher text an

245
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,330
important property is that if you pair

246
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,490
the I row vector here with the J's

247
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,440
column vector here what we get is the

248
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,900
target book using a pairing is this X I

249
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,370
YJ + RI SJ and in general if you know

250
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,490
the linear map F in the over CP you can

251
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,890
by pairing appropriately the row vector

252
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,330
with a column vector what you get is f

253
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,150
of X Y which is a useful information we

254
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,090
want to plus some blinding factor f of

255
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,690
RS

256
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,210
so if you set up the secret key for F to

257
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,580
be exactly this term here then you can

258
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,340
recover f of X Y only if you have a

259
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,180
secret key for F right intuitively so

260
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,300
this is a scheme so the security comes

261
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,600
from the fact that the only meaningful

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,030
fee an adversary could compute is given

263
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,580
many sight challenge ciphertext it's the

264
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,110
only thing you can compute meaningful

265
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,720
that is pairing a row vector from one

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
ciphertext with a column vector from

267
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,650
these same ciphertext because if you

268
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,060
tries for example to do mix and match

269
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,390
attacks by pairing a row vector from one

270
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,430
ciphertext with a column vector for

271
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,050
another cycle text that would be

272
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,600
meaningless because it will be paired

273
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,040
with a different W so yeah it will be

274
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,110
meaningless and he's can be formalized

275
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,240
in the Jericho model so essentially it's

276
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,570
as if the adversary view only contains

277
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,530
this kind of value here for any F of the

278
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,570
adversary's choice so this is all the

279
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,370
adversary can see essentially you can

280
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,180
computer that prom and using DGM and of

281
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,700
course so the adversary's allowed to get

282
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
some secret key for some functions so if

283
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,160
you get as SK of F of course is the

284
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,840
adversary is going to be able to recover

285
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,330
f of X Y that's normal but if F is not

286
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,370
the collision of key is that the

287
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,920
adversary gets then as I said f of X Y

288
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,630
is going to be computationally blinded

289
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,790
by this factor here so in the end the

290
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,550
adversary only learns F of XY for the

291
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,890
functions F that you could get a queue

292
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,550
for all right so intuitively this is the

293
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,550
proof right so now let's look at the so

294
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,380
this was the private private key scheme

295
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,300
if we want to make it a public key

296
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,050
scheme well if we need to make the RI

297
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,280
and SJ as group elements public so the

298
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,350
public is produced a master secret key

299
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,660
but now of course all the secret key for

300
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,630
all functions F are publicly computable

301
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,220
so that should not be so we modify this

302
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,850
security for F to be in this group but

303
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,160
still you can still decrypt cipher text

304
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,440
using

305
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
one is a public key so we need to make

306
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,070
use of the fact that now the secret

307
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,830
hidden in the group isn't in the source

308
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,010
group so the way we do so is by adding

309
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,920
some randomness in the encryption we'll

310
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,650
pick a freshly a teaching each

311
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,040
encryption a random scalar Sigma that is

312
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,460
going to be inserted here

313
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,140
and also added in the last part of the

314
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,150
ciphertext as a group element all right

315
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,010
so remember bracket notation means that

316
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,660
so this is due to the little G to the

317
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,090
Sigma all right so now when we pair the

318
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,040
iron when we pair this thing with this

319
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,200
thing what we get is as before F of XY

320
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,130
plus now F of Rs but multiplied by this

321
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,950
Sigma right so now essentially

322
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,780
intuitively the public he becomes

323
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,910
useless because publicly the public key

324
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,920
only gives you f of RS but in the target

325
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,840
group and what you need is to decrypt is

326
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,440
Sigma x + 4 s so you really require the

327
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,570
fact that the secret squicky of F now

328
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,620
it's in the source book alright so again

329
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,910
intuitively so the intuition can be

330
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,330
translated into a proof at least in the

331
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,400
generic group model for standard

332
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,570
assumption we'll have to do a little

333
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,230
more work but intuitively it's as if the

334
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,720
adverse review only contains some random

335
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,560
Sigma for from the ciphertext and this

336
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,070
kind of a quantity here and nothing more

337
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,020
everything else that we can compute will

338
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,300
be useless a 20 intuitively and from

339
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,660
this the adversary can only get F of XY

340
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,300
if he knows or she knows the secret key

341
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,720
5 right and if she she doesn't know then

342
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,290
this is lying it again that's it for

343
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,920
security so now we want to prove that is

344
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,890
secure in the standard model one

345
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,770
technique we use is inspired by what is

346
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,600
called dual pairing vector space that's

347
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
introduced by O'Connor takashina in the

348
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,580
context of attribute based encryption

349
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,540
adaptively secure drumbeat based

350
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,930
encryption in promoter pairing groups

351
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,980
you don't need to know exactly what this

352
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,320
is all you need to know is that

353
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,040
essentially we are going to change

354
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,570
transform the scheme the previous scheme

355
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,020
I showed you by transforming RI and as J

356
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,150
in two vectors now I was his vector so

357
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,830
just a random vector and as they's just

358
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,320
a random vector also of appropriate

359
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,880
dimension dimension to in fact it's

360
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
sufficient and concatenated with some 0

361
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
slot you will see why this lot is useful

362
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,770
later and all of this is also used with

363
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,070
a dual basis V and V minus 1 so V again

364
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,950
is a random invertible matrix ok ok so

365
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,170
the impact of on the secret key would be

366
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,870
this so before this was a secret key now

367
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,400
this is just like this I've just

368
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,830
replaced RI and SJ by this thing this is

369
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,700
what I obtained ok so so far so good but

370
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,590
why do we need why do we do that what is

371
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,740
the magic of a dual pairing vector space

372
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,500
it allows two computers only switch this

373
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,680
blue vector here by this vector here so

374
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,650
essentially you can add anything you

375
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,020
want in the extra slot so you can for

376
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,210
all X I and YJ of your choice you can

377
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,190
say that this is computationally

378
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,140
indistinguishable from this by using a

379
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,130
standard assumption dealing in our case

380
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,930
and also you have this quadratic term

381
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,570
and somehow we could show that we can

382
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,640
this effect on the secret key is to have

383
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,070
exactly two exactly had what we want f

384
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,870
of XY origin originally in the DP vs

385
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,610
there is only one there is only these

386
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,890
vectors there are no quadratic terms so

387
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,480
the novelty the technical novelty in

388
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,910
this one is two also so it's to carry on

389
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,310
the TPVs proof or in the presence of

390
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,290
quadratic terms this is a technical

391
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,660
challenge result all right so now let's

392
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,910
go back to our scheme and see how this

393
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,619
applies so now I just replaced our is j

394
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,410
with vectors this is a scheming we have

395
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,300
this is very close to the scheme that

396
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,550
actually in the paper and so now

397
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,470
everything is blown up the size is a bit

398
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,260
larger and so again intuitively there is

399
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,609
one part of the proof that I'm not going

400
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,119
to exactly explain but intuitively the

401
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,860
adversary can only extract from this

402
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,550
type a text this kind of information you

403
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,530
can only the only meaningful thing can

404
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,840
compute again is that pairing suspect

405
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,540
row vector with this con

406
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,760
anything else is useless and the

407
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,140
challenge we also solve is to prove that

408
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,820
in the standard under standard

409
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,550
assumption all right so again it's as if

410
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,890
the adversary only gets this information

411
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,420
this is the adversary to you essentially

412
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,790
and now using this magic of DPS we can

413
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,170
switch the secret key for F so for all

414
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,520
the secret keys that are not queried by

415
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,640
the adversary we can switch them and as

416
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,380
before I showed you you can add enough

417
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,230
an offset f of X so essentially with the

418
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,360
dealing assumption using the DPS we can

419
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,210
erase all the information about about f

420
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,720
of X Y all right so that's essentially

421
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,210
the proof to conclude so we built a Fe

422
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,860
scheme for quadratic functions with

423
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,580
cipher text size linear in n plus M from

424
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,040
pairing so these are we have two schemes

425
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,960
one is it adaptively secure the other

426
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
selectively secure but there are based

427
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,830
on different assumption and this is

428
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,440
exactly the circuit exercise in number

429
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,910
of group elements of source group

430
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,700
elements all right so there's an open

431
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,220
question will be interesting to explore

432
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,960
from standard assumption for example

433
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,300
pairing but maybe something else what

434
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,670
the classes of function more expressive

435
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,270
classes of function that we could build

436
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,170
that concludes my talk thank you

437
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:09,619
[Applause]
