1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,000
okay thanks for the introduction I'm

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,680
gonna talk about this heavy hammer that

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,980
the stephanie was talking about so we've

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,360
seen a bit already but I will never let

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,029
introduce it in my own terminology two

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,830
basic primitives in symmetric crypto are

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,480
potato random permutations like block

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,420
ciphers and potato random functions and

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,039
historically

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,020
it is a topic in symmetric crypto to

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,840
relate these two primitives this dates

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,580
back to the looping wreck of

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,070
construction the faisal networks who use

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,120
PRF and design a PRP on top of this

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,100
however if you look at it it makes more

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,989
sense duty other way around because

17
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,210
people know how to build a PRP and don't

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,090
know how to natively build an efficient

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,520
PRF so in this work we look at the other

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,719
way around and a very famous

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,730
construction in this direction was the

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,530
one that stefano show two slides ago was

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,390
the sum of permutations or the XOR of

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,780
permutations and so quickly go over it

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,969
we have two block cipher calls calling

26
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,789
it and with a secret key p1 and p2 the

27
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,860
steady input goes into both and the

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,289
output gets exhort the scheme dates back

29
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,450
to bolero and friends in 1998 and

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,700
various results including the one from

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,530
two slides back I didn't add it I'm

32
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:14,800
sorry

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,990
and proof optimal security of the scheme

34
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,819
there's many applications there is also

35
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,849
a variant with a single key primitives

36
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,759
we use one block cipher evaluation and

37
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,950
the input gets just prepended with a bit

38
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,940
to do the main separation em at crypt

39
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,560
were last year but equally athena

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,110
introduced encrypted davis meyer and

41
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,090
encrypted davis Meyer also uses two

42
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,910
block cipher calls and with a secret key

43
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,789
p1 and p2 the input value goes into the

44
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,380
first block cipher call and then it gets

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,080
fed forward over the first call and then

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,229
the resulting value gets encrypted again

47
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,729
Kali Athena's for improved security up

48
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,679
to 2 to the 2 and over 3 queries and

49
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,179
conjectured that this construction is in

50
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,720
fact optimally secure and they actually

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,270
had EDM as a side result namely they

52
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,039
focused on encrypted Raymond Carter

53
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,250
Davis Meyer and conveniently abbreviated

54
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,818
to e w CDM and essentially it's a non

55
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,459
space a Mac function it gets input the

56
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,829
nonce and the nonce goes through idiom

57
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,569
and in the middle you acts or the

58
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,930
universal hash from

59
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,209
shakaal evaluated on a message and also

60
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,069
this mac function has proved insecure up

61
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,650
to 2 to the 2 end of a tree and

62
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,239
conjecture to the optimal security to be

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,180
optimally secure and in this work we

64
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,200
prove optimal security up to some small

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,489
loss and more data were proof that

66
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,290
encrypted davis meyer and encrypted this

67
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,900
module are secure up to 2 to the N

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,760
divided by n so 2 to the N and divided

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,909
by a small logarithmic loss in addition

70
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,560
we look at encrypted Davis Meyer so

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,389
forget about the dashed line now we

72
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,310
thought well it makes more sense to do

73
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,659
the feed forward over the second block

74
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,120
cipher call so if you look at the duo so

75
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,319
this is what we call encrypted Dave

76
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,209
smart duel it's the same construction

77
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,739
but then feed forward goes over the

78
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,810
second block cipher call we proved that

79
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,430
encrypted Dave's my er duo which is

80
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,129
equally efficient is optimally secure

81
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,230
and those are the main contributions of

82
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,019
our work and in an earlier version we

83
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,359
also had a dual of the Mac function but

84
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,549
mojito found I pointed out that we made

85
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,230
a very stupid mistake in the proof so we

86
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,349
removed at the scheme and sort of foot

87
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,120
but the main focus is encrypted Davis

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,129
Meyer and encrypted Davis Meyer at duo

89
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,739
and the backbone of the analysis is that

90
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,099
this this heavy hammer smear theory and

91
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,900
I think the mirror to you is a very

92
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,780
powerful approach and achieving optimal

93
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,989
security at a high level the ideas

94
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,090
essentially community Oracle's and

95
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,549
coming tutorials

96
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,989
so suppose we have in this case our

97
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,079
equate our unknowns so this beautiful P

98
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,049
paragraph P denotes are distinct

99
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,579
unknowns so we know that they're

100
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,349
distinct but they are unknown and we

101
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,419
have Q equations over these are unknowns

102
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,989
of this form so P AI plus b bi is lambda

103
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,049
I and the lab has of course known so if

104
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,569
our unknowns and Q equations and there

105
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,479
is some implicit search action so and if

106
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,349
for instance 5 a 1 is 5 a 2 and these

107
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,810
are the same unknowns so there is an

108
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,000
implicit rejection here but essentially

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,159
the problem is you have Q equations over

110
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,620
our unknowns and the goal is to derive a

111
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,389
lower bound on the number of solutions

112
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,550
to the unknowns

113
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,039
such that they are all this thing it's a

114
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,860
very combinatorial problem right

115
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,699
and whether it has many applications and

116
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,150
Wow pattern I derived an extremely low

117
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,719
extremely powerful lower bound on this

118
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,419
number of solutions but for some reason

119
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,919
it has remained unnoticed in the field

120
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,889
of crypto for a long time so it was

121
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,909
introduced back in 2003 and it has been

122
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,009
used by some and some articles but not

123
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,539
many and to give you an impression how

124
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,069
unknown it has remained since the

125
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,009
introduction 14 years ago I added a list

126
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,990
of all results that use patterns mere

127
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,409
theory

128
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,750
so it starts of course with the original

129
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,069
publication and it was still on

130
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,219
suboptimal bound in 2003 later patter I

131
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:13,300
used it in 2004 petroi used it in 2005

132
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,529
optimal security which next button ran a

133
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,800
mantra approved it in 2005 but I proved

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,729
it used it in 2008 and but Arab used it

135
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,379
in 2008 again but arrived in 2010 but

136
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,550
when I used it for the sum of

137
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,610
permutations it can create bound finally

138
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,440
but I used it in 2010 for the fights of

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,539
construction I guess you see the pattern

140
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:41,409
right and butter I used in 2013 for some

141
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,889
permutations and improved bound ah yes

142
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,779
Kali ah tea lamp and pattern I approved

143
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,560
it I use it to prove a sort of multiple

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,800
permutations and so what's next

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,379
Fulton a chef Emmalee I use it beginning

146
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,289
a previous year for a feistel network so

147
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,849
this is the first article that does not

148
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:06,250
include a patent rare but some people

149
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,349
among you may recognize this name so

150
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:10,719
it's for close authors and students of

151
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,189
pattern and so only in the end of last

152
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,419
year we applied it em so that's who me

153
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,810
and Dom Ian were we are not and we have

154
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,669
done we don't have any relation with

155
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,449
butter I am but we found out that this

156
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,939
result actually proved security of

157
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,889
seeing optimal security of the c-anca

158
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,610
and christiansí from 2006 in fact the

159
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,969
results from 2005 proof that see ank of

160
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,500
2006 was optimally

161
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,780
secure and it has remained rather

162
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,070
no even though it is a powerful

163
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,330
technique and I'm gonna explain you the

164
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,600
technique at a high level and to think

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,820
about the technique to get the intuition

166
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,680
it makes sense to think of this system

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,740
of equations as a graph so recall we

168
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,000
have our unknowns and Q equations and we

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,310
can visualize this in terms of graph

170
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,200
so this graph consists of our nodes and

171
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,650
Q edges in this case for instance PA 1

172
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,560
plus PB 1 is lambda 1 this means that we

173
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,500
add this edge labeled by lambda 1 into

174
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,640
this graph in this case also P a1 equals

175
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,130
P a2 which effectively means that the

176
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,570
Phi of a 1 is 2 Phi of a 2 so we can

177
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,250
transform the system of our equate Q

178
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,400
equations with our unknowns into a cross

179
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,760
with our nodes and Q edges and now we're

180
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,930
going to lower part the number of

181
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,430
solutions but let's first look at 3

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,000
silly examples 3 2 examples the first

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,260
one is rather simple we have three

184
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,130
equations and two unknowns three

185
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,680
unknowns and two equations I'm sorry PA

186
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,900
plus PB is lambda 1 PB plus PC is

187
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,370
leopard 2 we have this nice graph

188
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,470
associated with it and now we got a

189
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,000
lower part the number of solutions to

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
the unknowns but it's obvious that if

191
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,550
lambda 1 is 0 for instance and her first

192
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,740
equation reads be a equals B B and

193
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,330
that's impossible that's a contradiction

194
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,590
because you'll know it should be

195
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,020
distinct so in this case we have several

196
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,220
solutions that we call the scheme

197
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,010
degenerate also flap that 2 is 0 it is

198
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,110
degenerate if you have that one equals

199
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,840
lambda 2 we can sum the two equations

200
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,910
and we see that PA should be equal to PC

201
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,610
which is also a contradiction and we

202
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,930
call on either of these cases we call

203
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,090
the scheme degenerate briefly looking

204
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,500
forward the generously means that there

205
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,990
is a path in this graph of which the sum

206
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,510
of the labels is 0

207
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,159
now suppose it's not degenerate so the

208
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,630
lambda i's are non 0 and they are

209
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,229
distinct

210
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:41,710
now we're just gonna fix the some

211
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,380
solutions so we first fix 2 to the N

212
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,380
well be the unknowns are ended values we

213
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,890
have 2 to the N possible choices for PA

214
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,580
but once PA is fixed this fix is P B

215
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,860
because b PB is lambda 1 XOR

216
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,160
be a MPB is of course different from PA

217
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,350
because we have the one s non zero

218
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,890
this in turn fixes peace P see because

219
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,880
PC is lambda 2 plus PB so in total we

220
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,380
have 2 to the N solutions to the system

221
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,940
a more complicated example is this more

222
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,980
comp is actually more complicated even

223
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,570
though it looks simpler we have two

224
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,390
equations and four unknowns so PA plus

225
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,700
PB is number one PC plus PD is lab the

226
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,980
two again we have the generous e if like

227
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,839
the one or lab the two is zero for the

228
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,540
same reason as before so suppose we have

229
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,519
different non zero lambda 1 and lambda 2

230
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,200
again just going to count the number of

231
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,149
solutions we have 2 to the N possible

232
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,660
choices for PA this fixes PA and it

233
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,140
hands fixes PB and but now the question

234
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,029
is how many choices do we have for PC

235
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,149
and PD well we require that PC is not

236
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,570
equal to PA and PB because unknowns are

237
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,870
distinct PD which is defined as lambda 2

238
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,990
plus PC should also be unequal to PA and

239
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,060
PB essentially this means that we have

240
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,240
at least 2 to the N minus 4 choices for

241
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,209
PC and the total number of solutions is

242
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,550
at least 2 to the N times 2 to the N

243
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,800
minus 4 could be more but we have at

244
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
least this and this is how the lower

245
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,600
bound technique works a third example is

246
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,390
when we have a circle so we have three

247
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,860
equations three unknowns then we have a

248
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,470
beautiful circle for simplicity assume

249
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,240
we have known the generous it will have

250
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,220
the eyes are nonzero level I is not

251
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,760
equal to lambda J suppose now that

252
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,860
lambda 1 plus lambda 2 plus lambda 3 is

253
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,010
not equal to 0 in this case if we sum

254
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,380
the three equations we see that we

255
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,940
should actually have lambda 1 plus

256
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,360
lambda 2 plus lambda 3 is 0 so if this

257
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,490
is the case we have 0 solutions and

258
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,870
recall that we say that the scheme

259
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,390
contains a circle for obvious reasons

260
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,750
because it contains a circle and if the

261
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,630
lab does sum to 0 we don't have a

262
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,130
contradiction but essentially we ever

263
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,589
had done an equation we can get rid of

264
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,570
the last equation without loss of

265
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,250
generality and we are back at example 1

266
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,440
and this is a little bit the technique

267
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,140
behind the mayor theorem or

268
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,260
we see two types of problems the problem

269
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,300
one is when there is a circle of size at

270
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,760
least two a problem two is when there is

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,070
a degeneracy meaning that there is a

272
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,370
path of length at least one of which the

273
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,420
labels sum to zero but Ryan approved the

274
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,250
following powerful result he proves that

275
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,260
if the system of equation is a circle

276
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,800
free and non degenerate then the number

277
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
of solutions to the unknowns is at least

278
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,450
two to the end falling factorial R

279
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,360
divided by 2 to D and Q so to be clear

280
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,370
this 2 to the N with a subscript R means

281
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,590
2 to the N 2 to the n minus 1 2 to the n

282
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,250
minus 2 up to 2 to the n minus R plus 1

283
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,110
divided by 2 to the N Q where Q is the

284
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,150
number of equations are the unknowns and

285
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,010
that's a pattern approved provided that

286
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,520
the maximum tree size X I satisfies I

287
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,760
minus 1 square times R is at most 2 to

288
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,570
the N divided by the magical number 67

289
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,800
and so that's the technical condition

290
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,430
for the proof M and to see the power of

291
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,170
this mirror theory let's look at the sum

292
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,050
of permutations and and our focus on the

293
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,520
single permutation variant so we have

294
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,830
one permutation with the main separation

295
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,300
in front of it so the main separation in

296
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,520
front of it and considerate adversary

297
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,340
adversary' that gets a transcript

298
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,320
consisting of Q evaluations of the

299
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,210
scheme every evaluation kind of defines

300
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,820
two inputs to the permutation right so

301
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,850
we have X I goes to P of 0 concatenated

302
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,430
with X I and of 1 concatenated with X I

303
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,050
and if you define these values as Pai

304
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,290
and PB I every tuple every query that

305
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,000
the attacker maze corresponds to an

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,310
equation so we have Q equations of this

307
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,220
form P AI plus bi is why I by design we

308
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,140
have two Q unknowns because the inputs

309
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,910
to the permutations are always different

310
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,410
so we have two Q unknowns and Q

311
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,240
equations if you draw the graph you just

312
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,420
have a few lines so the this is

313
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,630
essentially the graph q queries they are

314
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,330
disconnected it's clear that the scheme

315
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,850
has no circle so there is no circle in

316
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,970
the picture it is non degenerate

317
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,250
provided that there is no path of which

318
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,990
the labels sum to zero essentially this

319
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,150
means that there is

320
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,850
this is non-degenerate as long as the

321
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,250
wise are not equal to zero for all eyes

322
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,790
in addition the maximum three sizes too

323
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,010
and if you apply the mirror theory we

324
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,070
see that if 2q is at most two to the

325
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,890
power n divided by 67 we have at least 2

326
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,110
to the N falling factorial to Q divided

327
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,880
by 2 to the NQ solutions to the unknowns

328
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,890
that's the mayor theory the question now

329
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,670
is how to use this and I will quickly go

330
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,770
over it because of time and it's very

331
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,060
simple approach is using the H

332
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,490
coefficient technique and H coefficient

333
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,100
technique consists of looking at all

334
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,840
possible transcripts so everything the

335
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,920
attacker can see is all possible

336
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,870
transcripts and to divide these

337
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,640
transcripts into good ones and bad ones

338
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,790
and then the goal is for good ones proof

339
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,530
that the probability that you get a good

340
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,870
transcript in the real guns for the real

341
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,880
construction I divided by the

342
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,050
probability that you get a better

343
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,970
experience transcript in the ideal

344
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,150
construction it's close to 1 and then

345
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,370
the security bound is upper bounded by

346
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,800
this epsilon plus the probability that

347
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,350
you actually get a bad transcript in the

348
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,840
random world so this is a very famous

349
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,380
proof technique in our case we say that

350
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,330
the transcript is bad if the

351
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,940
corresponding graph is degenerate

352
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,980
because in that case we cannot apply the

353
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,230
mayor theory so saying that the

354
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,600
transcript is bad if the traffic graph

355
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,250
is degenerate means that the transcript

356
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,690
is bad if there is a wide at is 0 and

357
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,410
recall if you go back to the

358
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,600
construction quickly why can never be 0

359
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,690
in this case so it makes sense and the

360
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
random vote Y can be 0 in the real world

361
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,410
it cannot be 0 the probability that you

362
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,240
get a bad transcript is about Q over 2

363
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,910
to the N and then for the analysis of

364
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,590
good transcript what it boils down to

365
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,300
I'll quickly go over it it's a bit

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,530
technical but essentially what it means

367
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,650
is you have to compute the number of

368
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,040
permutations that fit to a certain

369
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
transcript so given the transcript

370
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,170
derive a lower bound on the number of

371
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,280
computations that fit this transcript

372
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,630
and this is what Mayor theory does

373
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,070
because here we see the bounds from the

374
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,740
mayor theory and this is the number of

375
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,240
solutions the probability that you get

376
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,330
any of these solutions is this term

377
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,710
times

378
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,420
ability that you get one of these and

379
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,700
for a random one you just get two to B&Q

380
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,230
and if you do the math you will find

381
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,720
epsilon a 0 and you get a Q over two to

382
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,850
the n security and that's how the mirror

383
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,080
Theory works for the sum of permutations

384
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,940
and this is not my proof so this was all

385
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,060
from putana and but now encrypted davis

386
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,670
meyer encrypted davis meyer is different

387
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,560
because it's sequential it's not a some

388
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,310
permutations right well if you look at

389
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,410
it a bit closer it is because if the

390
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,000
attacker gets the transcript and if you

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,770
fix the transcript it boils down to a

392
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,250
computation of the number of

393
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,860
permutations that fit the transcript now

394
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,950
if I look at the picture so the X goes

395
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,230
that forward to the middle we just put

396
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,200
it from the top as the same screen right

397
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,580
but if the transcript is fixed the

398
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,740
arrows in the scheme don't matter that

399
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,810
much anymore so we are just going to

400
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,160
swap the arrows for p2 so the EMD

401
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,810
encrypted if smile is essentially a sum

402
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,450
of permutations in the middle and now we

403
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,860
can apply the MER theory the more detail

404
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
if you have one query it corresponds to

405
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,060
two evaluations namely P 1 of X I which

406
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,390
I define as PA I be to a verse of Y I

407
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,330
which I define as PB I and then we have

408
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,340
a system of Q equations of the form P AI

409
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,570
plus PB is X Y it is a bit difference

410
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,190
from the mere theory from the sum of

411
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,170
permutations because in this case the Y

412
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,619
values can collide so the X values are

413
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,180
always unique to Y values can collide

414
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,099
and this means that the PBA eyes make a

415
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,650
line if you now draw the graph you don't

416
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,690
have just a axis well you also have

417
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,170
access but the edges can collide so here

418
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,690
the PA eyes they correspond to the input

419
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,150
two and the first permutation those are

420
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,730
always distinct but we could have

421
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,040
collisions at the Y side so in this case

422
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,800
we have various trees this is a tree

423
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
with sy 1 anxious so this means you have

424
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,440
x i1 fault collision on the Y's so this

425
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,630
is how the intuitively the graph looks

426
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,270
right now again we're gonna apply the

427
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,890
mirror theory but here we but now a

428
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,780
small relaxation because we use

429
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,480
different permutations

430
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,630
it is circle free right itself obviously

431
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,860
go free you can see it from the picture

432
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,850
it is non-degenerate and I need to note

433
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,590
here that we use different permutations

434
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,560
so if for instance x1 is 0 it doesn't

435
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,240
matter because we use different

436
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,280
permutations but if you have a path of

437
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,650
length 2 of which the labels sum to 0

438
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,810
then you have a problem but the axes are

439
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,480
all distinct so you never have a problem

440
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,510
the maximum three sizes X is 1 provided

441
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,640
there's no sighs one fault collision in

442
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,970
the Y value and then you do the you

443
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,580
apply Miller petrest merge theory and

444
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,950
you find that if X I squared times Q is

445
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,560
at most two to the N divided by 67 you

446
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,930
have at most this number of solutions to

447
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,590
the unknowns and I'm gonna make a

448
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,810
shortcut to the conclusion and we find

449
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,100
that the security of encrypted

450
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,650
davidsmeier is that most Q over 2 to the

451
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,780
N which comes from the loss using the

452
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,330
relaxation of the MER Theory plus Q

453
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,910
choose side plus 1 divided by 2 to the N

454
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,500
psi which is the probability that you

455
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,080
have multi collation and hence a

456
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,660
violation of the tree size and that's

457
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,400
the technique used for encrypted

458
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,650
davidsmeier you can do the same thing

459
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,690
for encrypted wave mankato davidsmeier

460
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,020
and so recall that in occur to break

461
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,490
macarthur they've inspired anons is

462
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,770
always unique which i have a message of

463
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,690
which the hash value goes in here so we

464
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,760
again swap the errors we have some

465
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,790
permutations in the middle and two

466
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,610
evaluations so the well X I goes to pai

467
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,580
why I goes to PB I we have a system of Q

468
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,490
equations of the form P AI + PB I is and

469
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,740
in this case we get the new I plus the

470
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,430
age of mi so as before the XS are you

471
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,060
the nonces are unique that then this

472
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,160
should be new and this should be T the

473
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,630
nonces are always unique that these

474
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,090
could collide but in addition these

475
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,010
values could collide so the graph now

476
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,420
looks essentially the same but you have

477
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,420
a problem if you have degeneracy again

478
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,460
we have no circle

479
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,140
degeneracy happens if you have two edges

480
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,040
in the same graph with the same label so

481
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,650
if in the same tree you have two edges

482
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,060
with the same label you have a problem

483
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,419
and this corresponds essential

484
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,220
to the remaining term because this one

485
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,869
we saw for encrypted Avis Meyer this one

486
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:10,269
we saw for encrypted Avis Maya this is

487
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:13,289
the probability that within 1/3 you get

488
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,690
to the same labels so cue choose 2 times

489
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,519
epsilon where epsilon as the quality of

490
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,320
the universal hash function divided by 2

491
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,859
to the N now for encrypted davidsmeier

492
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:26,440
duo and we can also prove it using

493
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,269
mirror theory but we did it in a simpler

494
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,309
way and the proof is essentially by

495
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,070
picture it's really a simple proof

496
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,019
because this is encrypted Davis Meyer we

497
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,840
can redraw this is same scheme so

498
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,580
instead of feet doing the feed-forward

499
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,619
here we doing the feed-forward from the

500
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:43,119
beginning but we per muted it's the same

501
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,739
picture is it well it's a different

502
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,989
picture but the same scheme but the

503
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,480
permutations p1 and p2 are independent

504
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,779
random permutations so why don't we just

505
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,419
replace this by a random permutation say

506
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:58,269
p3 and these are probabilistically

507
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,730
equivalent and this is the sum of

508
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,580
permutations which is optimally secure

509
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,289
so encrypted Aves module is at least as

510
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:08,139
secure as a sum of permutations and we

511
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,489
get optimal security which is better

512
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:12,059
security than encrypted davis meyer i

513
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,139
quickly want to go to future research

514
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,809
and and one interesting question is what

515
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,629
happens if the permutations are the same

516
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:21,070
for encrypted if Smyre and encrypt a

517
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,350
vague mankato davidsmeier the trick

518
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,820
doesn't work anymore because the trick

519
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,970
we used in the proof as to s is that we

520
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,269
invert p2 so the trick is that we keep

521
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,399
p1 as it is between vert b2 but if the

522
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,659
permutations are the same you cannot

523
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,779
just invert one and the trick really

524
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,549
fails and we don't see any way to prove

525
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,210
it for EB MD we also don't see a way to

526
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,859
prove it because there is a difficulty

527
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,720
there looks like there could be some

528
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,970
issues in some kind of sliding issues

529
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,669
but a bit more advanced and if the

530
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:53,080
permutations are the same and

531
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,480
nevertheless you don't see any attack so

532
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,830
we expect that these schemes achieve

533
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,779
optimal security or asymptotically

534
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,820
optimal security and to conclude I think

535
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,200
mayor theory is a very powerful

536
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,960
technique and I don't think it's better

537
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,460
or worse and chi-square technique it's

538
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,259
different both have their advantages and

539
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,929
disadvantages and it allows for

540
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:16,090
approving optimal security or almost

541
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,430
optimal security for various

542
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,460
instructions an interesting question are

543
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,140
the single key variants you will of

544
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,880
encrypted Davies ma and Cruz awaken

545
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,590
Carter Davis Meyer I think this is also

546
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,010
interesting because what we saw for EDM

547
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,080
versus EPMD

548
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,910
EDM and EDM D the schemes are equally

549
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,120
efficient button creatives module is a

550
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,510
way more secure or it's a bit more

551
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,860
secure and maybe the same could happen

552
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,980
for the Mac functions and I expect there

553
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,110
should be plenty of further applications

554
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,810
for the mayor theory and that concludes

555
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,990
my presentation thank you

556
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,339
