1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,910
good so in this work that is much more

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,309
than just a protocol and proof for four

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,900
round concurrent no malleable

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,360
commitments let's see what I'm going to

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,599
present so first of all there is a new

6
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,700
notion it's called the week normal

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,670
ability for commitments and in this

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,260
notion the men in the middle of the

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,320
adversary can commit only to well-formed

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,668
messages then there is a new

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,309
construction that is a three-round

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,470
Concannon on malleable commitment scheme

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,680
and it's better than the sub-exponential

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,839
is that your 1 to 100 functions so it's

15
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,210
a slightly strong assumption but the

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,909
nice part is that it can be instantiated

17
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,330
with any three round synchronous one one

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,549
week no malleable commitment where all

19
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,250
these words synchronous 1 1 and week

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,339
means that it's a very small and normal

21
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,949
ability forever that we amplify to the

22
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,839
concurrent availability so it's good

23
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,519
that there are all those words in

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,130
between three-round and malleable

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,900
commitment then there is a new notion

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,050
again this is for argument systems it's

27
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,370
called simulation witness

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,390
indistinguishability

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,110
and it's very interesting because it's

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,600
different in spirit from the malabar 0 I

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,160
drew malleable WI simulations on

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,710
zero-energy tarah well-known normal

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,930
ability flavors for artemon systems so

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,330
the reason we need this new notion is

35
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,180
that the previous notions turned out to

36
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,360
be insufficient for our final goal we

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,110
can construct moreover such a tool the

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,810
the sim wi argument system from one-way

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,300
functions in just four rounds one man in

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,400
particular what many means that the man

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
in the middle can play with multiple

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,450
verifiers

43
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,110
and finally that's the title of the of

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,650
the paper we will put pieces together to

45
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,570
get a four-round Concarneau malleable

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,390
commitment scheme the interesting part

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,699
is that our construction is absolutely

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,849
modular making use of these two tools

49
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,830
together so the final construction is

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,650
simple because we use these two tools in

51
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,090
the module

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,360
way it's very important because if you

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,800
have multiple associations of these

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,230
tools the moment when a sensation dies

55
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,480
because there is a bug our result still

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,489
stands because you can instantiate it in

57
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,000
multiple ways

58
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,720
anyway it's known how to implement the

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,370
this tool and the wrong way functions

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,230
and we implemented in this work this

61
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,450
tool with one-way functions so the final

62
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,399
result only requires a one-way function

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,440
ok you all know what the commitment

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,150
scheme is otherwise you will be sitting

65
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,840
in the other room with the title of red

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,720
torque so so let's go directly to the

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,700
normal ability game so we have an

68
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,500
adversary that will get a commitment of

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,720
either M 0 and 1 it doesn't know and it

70
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,370
tries to compute a commitment of a

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,970
message m prime that is related to M be

72
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,959
okay and there is a distinction that

73
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,360
will get the committed message of the

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,640
adversary in the clear the view of the

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,879
conversation and will try to output to

76
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,160
to gatsby that's the goal of the dresser

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,359
n distinction and very important in

78
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,340
general with a non malleable commitment

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,650
scheme the adversary might commit to a

80
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,599
bogus message a message it cannot be

81
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,049
operate at all it's part of its power it

82
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,910
can do that this is the one many non

83
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,410
malleability where the man in the middle

84
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,560
can play with multiple verifiers and

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,540
this is the many many case it's the

86
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,049
concurrent malleable commitment to

87
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,639
definition where the man in the middle

88
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,560
is allowed to play with multiple senders

89
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,299
and multiples verifiers

90
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,819
so there is a nice theorem of linear pal

91
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,549
they prove that you can just focus on

92
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,310
one many non malleability because any

93
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,810
one many non malleable compete with

94
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,340
scheme is also many many no malleable

95
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,959
commitment scheme so we will mainly

96
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,149
focus on this in this torque ok no now

97
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,220
let's so there is a lot that I have to

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,500
tell you so let's start with a big

99
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,900
problem the property we had to solve in

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,590
this work if you have many rounds more

101
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,889
than four and you want to design a con

102
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,050
my level commitment scheme you have the

103
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,199
following chance you can kind of make

104
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,300
some rewinds on the left triangle I

105
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,770
don't know in a reduction in the

106
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,900
security people to simulate something

107
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,210
right to basically send some bogus

108
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,680
message to the man in the middle to

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
extract something on the left and

110
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,599
moreover you can also do it in the other

111
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,729
fashion on the right because you have

112
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,310
many rounds there for the rewind that

113
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,110
you play on the Left does not interfere

114
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,699
with the reminder to pray on the right

115
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,889
okay this is possible but you need more

116
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,439
rounds more than forth the problem of

117
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,009
breaking the more than four round

118
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,710
barrier the multiple slot barrier was

119
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,620
solved by Goya at all in 2014

120
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,930
showing an available commitment women

121
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,740
just four rounds from one-way functions

122
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,479
so this required the significantly new

123
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,479
techniques to break this barrier but it

124
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,610
was limited to one what to do one one

125
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,080
case where the man in the middle plays

126
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,779
with one fender and one receiver okay so

127
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:39,349
in this work we break the multiples lot

128
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,240
barrier having just a foreign

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,550
constructions with full concurrency

130
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,110
where there are multiple senders and

131
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,389
multiple receivers this is the state of

132
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,330
the art after our work so you can see

133
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,509
that no malleability for commitments is

134
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,560
a very old problem it has been started

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,419
trying to improve the round compress it

136
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,219
the back three over beers the complex

137
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,469
assumptions the concurrency and we end

138
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:09,740
up having some very nice properties

139
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,439
because it is concurrent we need the

140
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,449
minimal essentials just so we functions

141
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,870
and we do it in four rounds and then

142
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,539
there is and 18 2016 because our work

143
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,879
was all line already in 2016

144
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,740
and then we have also the three round

145
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,659
construction that is based on

146
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,279
sub-exponential Institute one two only

147
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,990
functions but important thing is that is

148
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,089
a combination of these two tools so

149
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,279
therefore can be also associated in

150
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,830
different ways if there is a bug in in

151
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,529
one of the instantiations you know if

152
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,899
you take any many of these papers maybe

153
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,260
they have a bug then

154
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,390
everything is over right okay there can

155
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,450
be a bad wall so in our paper but then

156
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,340
the relevant parties that if the bag is

157
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,070
in the way we combine things it is a bug

158
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,380
if it's a bug in the underlying sub

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,510
protocol then we are fine as long as

160
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,980
there are more sensations of the sub

161
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,270
protocol because you can use another one

162
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,270
okay so a big effort that we made in

163
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,250
this work is to have all the students

164
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,720
that we have all this transactions both

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
of them that are modular combination of

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,490
two weaker flavors of no malleability

167
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,890
there is follow-up work this year for

168
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,030
new work that does not improve our work

169
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,820
still it's improved some dimension but

170
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,500
not some other dimension it's worse than

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
some other dimension in particular on

172
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,740
the complexity assumptions the new

173
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,570
papers that are appearing in talks or in

174
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,820
print they have they don't have stronger

175
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,830
compact see assumptions or their base or

176
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,270
number terrific assumptions ok ok so

177
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,530
let's start now without that sequence of

178
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,270
results so we started with no

179
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,030
malleability what is weak no

180
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,760
malleability for commitments it's a game

181
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,740
in which the main the middle is forced

182
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,170
to commit on the right so this is the

183
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,990
transcript of the conversation to a

184
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,750
message that can be successfully open it

185
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,350
later

186
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,170
it cannot commit an offence of sending

187
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,180
bogus messages and therefore later you

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,920
cannot open at all it's a restriction

189
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,630
right you might say why do we have this

190
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,520
restriction it's useless because in the

191
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,660
real world he can do whatever he wants

192
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,940
that's true but indeed my goal is to use

193
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,220
this as a building block to construct

194
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,960
full-fledged new malleability and it's

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,940
good to start with some wheat flour the

196
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,050
malleability because it's easier to

197
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,880
achieve in particular you can achieve it

198
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,350
under different assumptions different

199
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,600
constructions and then you build on top

200
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,070
of it that's what we do in this work so

201
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,500
there was a previous notion similar in

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,020
spirit of oil that is called normal

203
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,760
ability with respect to replacement but

204
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,590
it formalized the differently from what

205
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,690
I just discussed ok so we are done with

206
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,150
this new notion and now

207
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,640
let's go to step two is the construction

208
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,110
of three run concurrent available

209
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,510
commitments from tree ground separate

210
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,570
cetera okay so the point here as I told

211
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,950
is that we have this result based on

212
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,170
these tool three round synchron's one

213
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,940
one week no malleable commitment

214
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,279
interestingly for this tool for instance

215
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,529
there are two instantiation known

216
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,330
completely different so there are two

217
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,430
papers we are not part of these papers

218
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,110
but there are two different completely

219
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,400
different ways to construct this tool

220
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,050
okay from one one one two one one way

221
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,650
functions so if one of them when they

222
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,740
unfortunately dies because of a bag our

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,690
is AB stands because we can instantiate

224
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,180
everything with other result okay it's a

225
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,460
benefit of the modular construction that

226
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,130
we have okay for the actual construction

227
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,089
how we build on top of this tool to get

228
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,520
a 1:1 using also one two one seven

229
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,320
financially secure only functions

230
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,180
getting a Treo unrecoverable commitment

231
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,010
scheme you can see the full version I

232
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,480
don't have time because there is more

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,070
interesting stuff that I want to present

234
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,170
in the next minute okay let's continue

235
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,610
then we are done with step two and we

236
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,970
are now going towards step three so the

237
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,040
final goal is to show concurrent

238
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,290
available commitments so why am I going

239
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,480
to talk about our different systems so

240
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,279
I'll introduce now the reason why we

241
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,589
introduced a new notion and you know

242
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,440
malleability flavor for advanced systems

243
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,930
so this is a generic man in the middle

244
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,050
attack where there are multiple senders

245
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,790
multiple receivers and the man in the

246
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,070
middle can commit to Bob's messages or

247
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,100
to well-formed messages and there is a

248
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,200
construction very important of really

249
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,410
Palin thoughts 2014 that we are

250
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,620
distracted in this way first they have a

251
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,560
component that is fetcher against a

252
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,300
Wichman in the middle as you can see all

253
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,970
commitments here on the right are well

254
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,280
formed there is no bogus message because

255
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,900
this is the definition of week no

256
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
malleability that explained you if you

257
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,769
cool okay and they have a very important

258
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,149
construction they construct this

259
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,880
building block so against a weak man in

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,260
the middle they have a four-round

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,899
construction that is concurrent moreover

262
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,690
and based dolly on long wave functions

263
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,079
okay good

264
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,589
what do they do then they notice okay if

265
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:28,480
the problem of this construction is that

266
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,810
the man in the middle can commit to its

267
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,720
force to commit to well for the messages

268
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,980
only and we want to remove this limit we

269
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,450
can add the zero knowledge argument

270
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,100
whether when in the middle must prove

271
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,410
that the committed message is good okay

272
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,190
by adding this this argument of

273
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,380
knowledge then it's clear that here or

274
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,970
commitments are well-formed otherwise

275
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,170
you evaluate we are a regulated

276
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,990
soundness of the argument or knowledge

277
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,720
okay good so putting these two blocks

278
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,940
together they have a eight round

279
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,980
construction of a concurrent on my level

280
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,870
commitment scheme against

281
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,620
fully concur and malicious adversary

282
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,750
okay whatever this tool is also public

283
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,589
on this will be useful later but here we

284
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,269
have we have eight rounds so we are

285
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,209
still far from the barrier what we want

286
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,310
these four rounds because four rounds

287
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,350
means you have only one slot and it's

288
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,209
extremely tough to resolve the problem

289
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,050
okay so this is what we can do to have a

290
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,360
foreign construction okay let's not play

291
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,310
the 2/3 what was sequentially let's play

292
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,500
them in parallel and you get the foreign

293
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,920
construction right but let's see does it

294
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,750
work and can we really do such things

295
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,399
instead of playing sequentially we play

296
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,170
in parallel and everything is successful

297
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,880
let's see the man in the middle could

298
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,620
start playing his attack with two to

299
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,250
right sessions for instance so he played

300
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,959
the first three rounds on the last first

301
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,149
three rounds on the right then there is

302
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,010
the fourth round coming from the center

303
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,320
and the men in the lead men in the

304
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,079
middle can give a look not at the weak

305
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,300
normal level commitment that has a no

306
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,339
malleability Ferrer inside the

307
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,529
requisites in the world no Malibu but

308
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,449
here this this is just a zero our

309
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,100
judgment of an origin has nothing to do

310
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,690
with O'Malley

311
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,510
is extremely malleable the manager might

312
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,150
be able to touch this is this message

313
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,470
and to understand that it can complete

314
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:36,420
one session if here there is really m10

315
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,210
and to complete the other session ok m1

316
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,620
and another session if here there is n

317
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,460
zero okay so you can try to mole and to

318
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,860
complete a session on the right

319
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,140
depending on the message it is not in

320
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,790
the weaker malleable commitment but it

321
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,740
is use it as a witness in the zero

322
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,850
knowledge argument to knowledge okay and

323
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,650
you can just abort to the other one in

324
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,450
this example he completed this session

325
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,110
and aborted this one okay so but okay

326
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,350
you can see but case I have a proof I

327
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,460
don't care I mean there would be a way

328
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,400
to translate this adversary in a

329
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,160
reduction that breaks a primitive well

330
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,770
let's see let's go back again here it we

331
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,070
had the weaker malleable committed 0 nor

332
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,660
a judgment of knowledge in a sequence of

333
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,640
I breeds you will end up with the using

334
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,110
the simulator on the right that's why

335
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,630
it's zero knowledge otherwise you

336
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,880
wouldn't need zero knowledge and the man

337
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,640
in the middle now will not mole anymore

338
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,440
when he understands that there is a

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,700
simulator on the left

340
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,900
he will just complete a random session

341
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,030
ok so we have the Magnum is that in the

342
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,310
real game amor see actually complete the

343
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,050
session related to the committed message

344
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,770
on the left but when you start in a

345
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,380
security proof through the ibrid switch

346
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,060
to the simulator the man in Twitter

347
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,310
might just not more anymore and you know

348
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,310
reach a contradiction so it's precisely

349
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,690
the point in which you should then your

350
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,150
security proof make advantage of this

351
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,230
because the man in the middle is

352
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,480
essentially killing the simulator right

353
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,890
because if you put three approver

354
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,660
remorse if you put the simulator it does

355
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,800
not mall anymore

356
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,780
very good so reduction to the zero

357
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:20,580
knowledge let's do the reduction okay so

358
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,040
we have on the Left a challenger that

359
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,630
decides our approval or a simulator of

360
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,450
zero knowledge and we make use of this

361
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,400
man in the middle that is able to

362
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,559
translate the fact

363
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,839
this is provider other comes from

364
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,609
approver or from the simulator and

365
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,699
completing here either the commitment of

366
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,959
a message related to the to the session

367
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,289
on the left or completely unrelated okay

368
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,699
but surprise that if there is a

369
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,089
committed message here and you want to

370
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,609
see it you have to extract it in order

371
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:57,459
to extract it you have to rewind if you

372
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,889
rewind the man in the middle will ask to

373
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,689
play on the Left again but you have a

374
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,939
challenger here having the Challenger

375
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,369
means that you cannot ask the Challenger

376
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,109
to replay the fourth round you have to

377
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:11,589
play it on your own and how you cannot

378
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,149
play it on your own in zero knowledge if

379
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,949
you don't ever do witness okay so if

380
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,019
there is a challenger here playing four

381
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,839
rounds and you ask - you want to play on

382
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,439
your own a valid Fortran you cannot this

383
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:24,849
means if you are stuck in the reduction

384
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:29,529
okay so it's not so easy you cannot what

385
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,719
what we know now it's also easy to put

386
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:34,749
together in parallel rather than

387
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:40,479
sequential it is two sub protocols okay

388
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,970
that's the the big problem that I

389
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,979
unanswered already before when you have

390
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:47,259
only one slot it's very tough if you

391
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,749
extract on the right you are going to

392
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,179
disturb the session on the list in

393
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,679
particular the reduction if there is a

394
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,909
challenger you are rewinding the

395
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,979
Challenger so that's the big

396
00:16:56,979 --> 00:17:03,159
complication fortunately there is

397
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,618
already a solution so volatile solved

398
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:09,579
this problem they have a better zero

399
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,809
knowledge argument of a knowledge a

400
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,059
special one so not just any you play

401
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,679
with a special general judgment of

402
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,929
knowledge that is kind of resilient to

403
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,398
some rewinds okay so with this special

404
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:24,730
special tool that they constructed they

405
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,829
managed to get the four round

406
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,638
construction on the wrong way functioned

407
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:30,820
but this limited rewind that can be

408
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,399
tolerated by this general regiment of

409
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,440
knowledge is completely insufficient

410
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,330
when you have a multiple verifiers

411
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,559
because then you have to extract

412
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,490
everywhere and therefore there are it is

413
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,080
an uncontrolled number over ey

414
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,880
therefore their strategy dies and they

415
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,110
have only one one malleability okay so

416
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,580
the open question that we solve in this

417
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,220
work is to construct concurrent and

418
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,020
malleable commitment just with one-way

419
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,630
functions with four rounds and one

420
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,299
therefore one slot only this requires

421
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,870
new techniques okay so all this

422
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,860
discussion motivated the fact that we

423
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
need something better than just a

424
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,640
generic argument of knowledge and that's

425
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,039
precisely the the notion that we

426
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,600
construct there are some other

427
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,299
approaches possible one is just use

428
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,010
statistical zero knowledge argument of

429
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,230
knowledge this will stop the man in the

430
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,909
middle from looking at the zero

431
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:27,960
knowledge argument of knowledge

432
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,460
understanding the witness when doing

433
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,110
something because the heat race is

434
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,750
completely hidden you if the simulation

435
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,659
if statistical this will work actually

436
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,490
button project requires collision

437
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,630
resistant hash functions so much

438
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,870
stronger complexity assumption if you

439
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,150
you might think of using a non malleable

440
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,340
zero to a much stronger and general

441
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,970
definition but first of all there was no

442
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,280
construction in four rounds or many

443
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,130
until until a new work that we did this

444
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,429
year and second it doesn't work it's not

445
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,809
enough because in normal about your

446
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,000
knowledge there is nothing about the

447
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,970
distribution of the messages that are

448
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,409
used that the distribution of the

449
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,690
witnesses that is corresponds to the

450
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,360
messages here that is the real no

451
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,490
malleability the real point in which

452
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,659
remain in the middle is attacking is

453
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:17,280
attacking on the message used by the

454
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,049
prover in the general jewish do it press

455
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,610
and no malleable zero knowledge has

456
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,409
nothing to do with distribution of de

457
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,480
três just as soon as that the simulator

458
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,730
will figure out we will extract a

459
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,299
witness okay so it remains despite the

460
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,220
receipt of the art if we want to get

461
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,789
this result there is an open question

462
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,750
that must be solved okay so this was

463
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,990
their approach successfully they combine

464
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,440
these two tools to get a 1:1 malleable

465
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,690
commitment scheme and our approach is

466
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,540
different we replace this component with

467
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,010
a tool that is a simulation

468
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,600
we press independent argument of

469
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,480
knowledge with this tool we get four

470
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,730
unconquerable commitments okay

471
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,040
both tools can be inserted and the wrong

472
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
way function so we are fine the final

473
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,930
result is under one-way functions and we

474
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,180
are going to see this new notion so it's

475
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,740
an argument system it has an

476
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,750
availability fair so in the real game

477
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,910
you have a visual the man in the middle

478
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,200
playing on the left and on the right

479
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,330
this is the one many definition so there

480
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,120
are many verifiers and the man in the

481
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,210
middle will ask the prover to complete

482
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,180
the protocol and the left and you will

483
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,760
complete then the argument systems on

484
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,550
the right okay and now you have a

485
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,820
distribution of the witnesses

486
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,980
corresponding to the theorems proven on

487
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,270
the right by the man in the middle

488
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,530
because I'm assuming here that for every

489
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,970
instance there is just one witness but

490
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,530
therefore it's well-defined when you

491
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,720
have the theorems on the right the the

492
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,550
distribution of the witnesses encoded in

493
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,450
the proof on the right okay and this is

494
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,100
the real game then we have a simulated

495
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,990
game where of course since it's

496
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,540
simulated there is no witness played at

497
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,070
all on the left because there is a

498
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,270
simulator and we still have some

499
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,740
theorems proven on the right and you

500
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,150
take the distribution of the wheat

501
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,670
receptor on the right okay so now the

502
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,010
goal is that whatever is using here the

503
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,480
distribution of the witness that are on

504
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
the right we want them to be in

505
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,730
indistinguishable from the previous case

506
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,840
where there was a witness okay so this

507
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,610
is this English ability to game so this

508
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,040
is the definition of simulation WI so if

509
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,690
you play with the prover or with the

510
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,310
simulator the distribution of the

511
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,280
witnesses encoded in the proofs given by

512
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,570
the man in the middle on the right does

513
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,210
not change okay this is informally what

514
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,530
it means and informally we discuss in

515
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,850
the paper that this definition has

516
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,800
nothing to do with simulation extract

517
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,780
ability simulations unrest anomalous

518
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,040
Rondo malleable witnessing ability okay

519
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,490
good interestingly we can construct

520
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,650
these two

521
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,450
with one-way functions all in four

522
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,670
rounds but you might ask again why you

523
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,260
have only ones a lot so you might have

524
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,070
the same issues first observation this

525
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,230
notion does not require the simulator to

526
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,150
be also an extractor on the right this

527
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,030
helps okay it's a something that

528
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,270
simplifies second we have a protocol

529
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,380
design technique new that instead of

530
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,690
using for instance aw I'd meant of

531
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,900
knowledge that can be problematic in a

532
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,090
security proof because of the rewind

533
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,700
that will require to rewind the

534
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,360
Challenger

535
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,000
we actually who use all the components

536
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,860
that have known interactive challengers

537
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,500
and non interactive Challenger does not

538
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,900
suffer if the delivery whines so this is

539
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,420
the main protocol design technique that

540
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,900
allows us to pass this for round batter

541
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,800
the multiple slot barrier moreover there

542
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
is also an interesting new proof

543
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,790
approach technique that we there is in

544
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,530
particular in our security proof and

545
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,890
it's crucial for us in a hybrid in which

546
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,700
in the same hybrid we play in the same

547
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,559
argument system but with the proven and

548
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,990
with the simulator of a specialized very

549
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,910
far zero knowledge proof okay both

550
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,770
proven and severe in the same experiment

551
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,480
in the same session okay this is also

552
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,510
something apparently new for us at least

553
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,970
and it's fundamental so it's something

554
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,590
very important for us to reach the final

555
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,700
result we don't know how to do it

556
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,260
without this technique and for instance

557
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,170
this this gives you the flavor of the

558
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,790
difference with simulations and res

559
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,140
because simulations and which is about

560
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,020
simulating fourth theorem but if it's

561
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,400
the first year and I can not switch

562
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,170
between simulator improver because it's

563
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,059
force there is no proverb to prove a

564
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:50,190
fourth theorem

565
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,510
ok so any print you can see all the

566
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,250
details but here it's really the insight

567
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,420
of the crucial observation and the new

568
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,610
technique that we use and what we put in

569
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,130
the proof ok still have some time

570
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,850
good so now that we have this important

571
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,100
important component we can put together

572
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,770
simulation WI and we can availability

573
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,440
and now the proof is really smooth why

574
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,680
because you have

575
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,390
this is was the previous previous case

576
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,770
where he's attacked the man in the

577
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,010
middle is attacking the zero-knowledge

578
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,410
mauling according to the zero knowledge

579
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,390
so changing the witness that is on the

580
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,800
right occurred and therefore the message

581
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,350
according to the garage but simulation W

582
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,610
and this was the previous case

583
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,980
simulation WI completely resolve this

584
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,720
problem because it's a guarantee of

585
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,060
summation WI that when you switch from

586
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,130
prover to simulator the very demeanor

587
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,290
has not changed the messages encoded on

588
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,970
the right the witnesses that are the

589
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,520
messages encoded on the right and

590
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,930
therefore we can then also play a

591
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,270
reduction to the weak no malleable

592
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,550
commitment don't have a time to show you

593
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,650
so this reduction but now it's things

594
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,710
are easy and the resources on I think so

595
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,300
the reduction is also simplified by the

596
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,160
fact that the we can develop of

597
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,560
commitment is public go in and I can

598
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,850
conclude now so we broke the multiple

599
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,650
SWAT barrier for concurrent malleable

600
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,630
commitments using minimal complexity

601
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,870
assumptions and we have a three and four

602
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,300
instructions in particular making

603
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,940
modular use of sub protocols so this is

604
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,130
very useful because admits multiple

605
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,730
sensations we have a new notion for our

606
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,530
Ganesh system with a maybe with the new

607
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,900
applications in future for because of

608
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,360
the normal ability flavor and also it's

609
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,730
interesting that we show new protocol

610
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,310
design and proof approach techniques

611
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,280
thank you very much for your attention

612
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,849
[Applause]
