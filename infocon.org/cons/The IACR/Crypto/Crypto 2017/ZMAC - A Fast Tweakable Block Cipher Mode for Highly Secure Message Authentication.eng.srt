1
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,780
explore the introduction so I'm Kasich

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,430
coming Hudson from AC corporation and

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,590
this is that joint to rock we do take

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,110
the water from Nagoya University and I'm

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,279
a parent from NTU

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,449
and the annex aroma antsy so let me

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,970
start with the very basic things the

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,170
knack function this is the symmetric key

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,600
crypto for tampering detection and the

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,220
main component is a mac function taking

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:42,620
the key here and O key here and message

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,749
which has the variable length and to

13
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:47,239
produce the tag of the fixed length the

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,249
in the typical usage scenario are a

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,889
standard computers computer tag as an

16
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:53,300
app to go to the math function taking

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,379
key and am here and sent the the pair of

18
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,510
the math message and the tag to the ball

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,420
and Bob checks if this pair is correct

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,729
or not or by computing data locally and

21
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,670
if the receiver is compliant with the

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,979
same tag here and it is known that

23
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,369
they've mark function this is variable

24
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,049
input to length pseudo-random function

25
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:20,420
this Mac protocol is secure so the main

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,219
component of our construction is the

27
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,979
tweakable block cipher DBC which is an

28
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,689
extension of the old in a block cipher

29
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:33,520
introduced by risk of a 12 in 2002 and a

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,659
difference from the ordinary oxide is

31
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,659
that there the additional input called

32
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,390
the tweak which is a public which can be

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,820
public and the pair of the key and the

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,979
tweak specified the plantation set over

35
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,009
the message space and this talk is

36
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,070
assumed that the the messages of any

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,229
bits and the tweekly is always key bit

38
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,109
but here we also implicitly assume the

39
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,820
other additional small tweak are

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,369
represented on a small positive integer

41
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,399
I mainly used for the domain separation

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,990
I mean the data we need to support

43
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,818
introduce some independent instance of

44
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,960
the CBC and the writer here this mission

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,840
for NSA

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,900
so how to build a TBC so there are some

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,480
well-known brach cipher modes such as a

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,400
log W and the xes they are ultimately

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,470
efficient because it only required one

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,840
block cipher code to perform one CBC

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
encryption what security is also up to

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,370
the basket bound with respect to the

53
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,600
block lengths therefore the IES used

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,820
only a data complexity of the two to the

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,400
64 attack

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
we can break with this complexity there

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,010
are some modes that achieve the stronger

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,250
security guarantee meaning there beyond

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,400
the birthday bound security is possible

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,160
with some Moors but they are not very

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,390
efficient at least it's not as efficient

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,840
as the XV or llw so the other direction

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,980
is the design from scratch so starting

64
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,310
it from the hot departing first cipher

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,980
designed by shredder in 1998 that of

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,590
many tweakable a dedicated teacher block

67
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,500
ciphers the three fishing skiing hash

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,580
function and there are the multiple

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,700
instance of the TBC designed for other

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,060
main component in to see the submissions

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,300
and more recent ones the the skinny and

72
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,300
comma so for the security notion of TBC

73
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,489
it is a indistinguishability from the

74
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,959
set of independent uniform random

75
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,150
permutation the indexed by tweak which

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,670
way I also called the pickup a uniform

77
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,690
random permutation

78
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,269
TL t u LP you noted by tilde P and if

79
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,590
the adversary here can not distinguish

80
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,000
these two words even if the a chosen

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,519
cipher text attack where the trick is

82
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,339
also chosen it is called the TSP RP and

83
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,120
the issue it is difficult to distinguish

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,520
these two worlds the rendering TBC is

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,139
called

86
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:34,159
ERP okay so let me show the symbol of

87
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:38,270
this construction for Mac using TBC the

88
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,219
first one is the PMAG one introduced by

89
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:44,419
log away in the proof of the P back the

90
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,120
scheme is here other you can see the

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,279
this is free polarizable accept to

92
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,639
accept the final one but the security is

93
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,650
also up to the birthday bound with

94
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,909
respect to the brock side again so the

95
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,770
maximum advantage of the Premack one

96
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,169
from the distinguishing it from the

97
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,539
pseudo-random function as up to that

98
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,340
this term where that Sigma denotes the

99
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,960
maximum number of total queried rocks

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,300
so therefore this have the half of any

101
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,639
bit security the another one is kima CB

102
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,659
c 1k introduced by night 2 in 2015 which

103
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:27,080
is mostly similar quite similar to the

104
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,449
fema converted a pride approach that

105
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,370
different changing scheme having the to

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,610
any bits changing scheme here so we need

107
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,310
this shows the message has been part of

108
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,750
that prima TV c 1k and they had another

109
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,039
finalization step which is the SS area

110
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,990
to NB 2 input pseudo-random function

111
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,889
built from the TBC a nuke feature of

112
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,080
this game is it has the build us the

113
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,439
bound security that is it improves the

114
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,649
security of bhima to n bits while the

115
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,270
hippie who are keeping the same

116
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:05,240
computation cost a schema 1 okay but

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,349
these TBC based skips are not optimally

118
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,979
efficient because they process and beat

119
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,930
him to the power 1 TB c core so the

120
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,649
internal

121
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,759
yes in this scheme the internal to rock

122
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,029
cipher is invoked like this one however

123
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,629
that this T bits week so does not

124
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:30,379
process message just the it is readable

125
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:37,159
for computing the for the block index so

126
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,000
the simple question is here

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,550
how to build an optimization TVC best

128
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,330
Mac so in this talk a directive proposed

129
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,130
to propose to proposal the first one the

130
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,890
Mac yeah and the second one is Dae the

131
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,480
DMACC is a first optimally efficient TBC

132
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,330
best Mac name reader it processes the n

133
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,280
plus T bit input or one TBC coal and it

134
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,620
is also parallel and has a beyond

135
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
birthday bound security the most

136
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,080
specifically the security miss security

137
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,140
is this form minimum of n and half of n

138
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,950
plus T bit that is the if the T tweak

139
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,950
length is not more than n it has the N

140
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,900
bit security and the Dae Adana by

141
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,640
product of the DMACC which is an

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
application the DMACC to that

143
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,140
deterministic authenticated encryption

144
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,910
intercept i introduced by row and

145
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,060
Shrimpton in 2006 and it has the better

146
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,940
security and f-secure better efficiency

147
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,770
and the security down a city mode of

148
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,180
operation presented at the crypt of 2016

149
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,640
and was for using TBC at the soul

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,760
premium so there's no other components

151
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,090
like the field much large field variable

152
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,490
multiplication and they are provably

153
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,600
secure if TVC the T PRP so let me

154
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,990
explain the structure of eMac this is a

155
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,419
simple composition of the message

156
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,580
hashing and finalization where the

157
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,160
message hasin is called the hash and the

158
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,270
finalization is called deepen and output

159
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,490
of the DAC is always impressed TB it

160
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,590
says if in doubt put is the 2 n bits

161
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,969
here and if we need an shut out would

162
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,479
see it we can simply cut output final

163
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,870
output position and we provide a new

164
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,990
file specification for any T I mean that

165
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,900
T can be equal to the N or Raja tons of

166
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,740
smaller than n

167
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,770
okay and this talk will focus on D hash

168
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,899
because this is the most innovative part

169
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:05,220
of D Mac so when designing the D hash

170
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,279
the first observation is that to achieve

171
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,850
the optimal efficiency we somehow need

172
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,520
to extend the tweaks field tweak space

173
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,050
of the underlying tweakable block cipher

174
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,149
because otherwise there's no way to

175
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,800
incorporate the information with the

176
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Broadway index inside this computational

177
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,270
hash function and this can be done by a

178
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,339
frico extension scheme called the X DX

179
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,200
which were the introduced by Eva Tata

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,350
and myself in 2015 and this is an

181
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,770
exchange of llw and XE X so this is the

182
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,220
X DX so you can see that G here which

183
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,520
shows the globe art week which has space

184
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,279
large and up to 2 D T and all the other

185
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,149
key the function HL takes G and outputs

186
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,580
the n plus T bit outputs here the first

187
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,450
n bit output is used as a mask to the

188
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,910
input and output of the underwing TB c

189
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,760
and the second TV remaining t without

190
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,070
roots is used for the trick for the

191
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,649
internal TB c and this X DX is the

192
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,860
approver a secure if H has the property

193
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,459
called the if shrimp rochelle a xu e xu

194
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,420
shot and differentiate here it shows

195
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,720
that the only the first n bit part is

196
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,420
required to be differentially uniform

197
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,990
and the remaining T bit part has a small

198
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,730
should have a small portion probability

199
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,200
and the in your case the disc global G

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,110
big G consists of the two parts the

201
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,320
first part is the message information of

202
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,980
T bits and the second rise brach index

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,459
represented by a positive integer and of

204
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,440
course broken two indexes the counter

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
because we all will receive the first

206
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,290
broken the second rocks and so on so

207
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,750
then with this observation the FT

208
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,930
acts can be instantiated by using the

209
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,079
doubling to a cousin provided by and

210
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,480
popularized by XCX and optimized by

211
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,810
cutting the outer masks to I here

212
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,689
because we do not need a decryption in

213
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,100
the Mac computation so the lizard ink

214
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,230
scheme tweak extension schemes which we

215
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,060
call the XT is a using the HL defined by

216
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,850
this formula using the two and bit keys

217
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,790
l l and r so here you can see that two

218
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,399
to the I minus 1 times the LL and to the

219
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,810
Diamonds one-time sale of it they're

220
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,790
successful successive application of the

221
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,879
fields of doubling namely the

222
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,129
multiplication by two over the field of

223
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,279
G 2 to the N for I times I minus 1 times

224
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,579
here and if the we need a 2 to the I

225
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,370
times the X the it's computation is easy

226
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,870
by cashing the job Vario previous body

227
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,509
of the 2 to the I minus 1 times the X as

228
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:16,050
was done in XCX and for defining on you

229
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,089
find the specification we also

230
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,910
introduced a variant of the X for

231
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,730
pressure equity here which is just a

232
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,389
simple XOR operation but the first

233
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,939
argument is chopped or padded before

234
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,290
taking some and T is not equal to n what

235
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:41,490
our schemes here and we can show that

236
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,769
this XT is also a secure clickable rock

237
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,629
cipher if the under ring to a couple

238
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:50,879
block cipher is also a security cover

239
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,839
block cipher of the tip of tbg more

240
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,089
formally if the enduring t bc is the

241
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,550
perfect and if H is I've shown P a

242
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,089
excuse then the security advantage is

243
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,949
bounded by this quantity Q squared or x

244
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:08,309
ee over 2 and we observed at our age

245
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,829
function is a 1 over 2 to the n plus

246
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:15,450
minimum and TPA xeo so combining the

247
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,760
yeah two facts we get this security

248
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,070
bound if it shows that the essentially

249
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,090
xt has the minimum of n and plus a half

250
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,210
over n plus t bit security which is up

251
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,640
on the brass the bounds equity if t is a

252
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:37,380
positive integer so then after we get

253
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,170
the x the extension it's easy to apply

254
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,350
the FEMA Craig sigl chaining hashing

255
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,490
scheme like this one so message is

256
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,920
divided into n plus 2 beta profs and

257
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,630
upper and given to the TBC with the

258
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,350
Brock index and we get the hashing very

259
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,760
chaining Barrio as an XOR of the all

260
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,260
output XOR of the outputs of the 60 so

261
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,410
this is a pointer of 20 efficient but

262
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,300
the security is only up to the best

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,390
bound because we can easily detect a

264
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,510
quorum here the cause of the xt outputs

265
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,570
using the two to the hub and queries

266
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,950
fixing the second block and so on and

267
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,380
only changing the first block after

268
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,110
block here so we naturally need a larger

269
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,850
chaining Vario but if we naively used to

270
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,550
in which chaining scheme adopted by NATO

271
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,970
and the acid ER the skin would look like

272
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,540
this one but this also doesn't work

273
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,610
because we can still detect the quorum

274
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,190
here no matter how the garage is the

275
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:02,580
chaining scheme is okay so the key

276
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,490
observation here is to avoid these

277
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,430
collision attacks so we all we need a be

278
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,900
on the birthday bound security we need

279
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,260
to avoid these attacks the process of

280
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,820
the each message brock's you know shown

281
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,670
by this box must be a permutation so and

282
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,010
we also need a some other technical

283
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,230
conditions about the dissident yeah even

284
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,020
most important observation and we found

285
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,040
that this Facebook right around of the

286
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,140
one round amputation using the only one

287
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,620
XD call inside the box works actually

288
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,010
works the laser beam scheme which I

289
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,830
showed a lot has the D hash in the

290
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,100
masked ball wants has good corrosion

291
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,070
probability memory it is efficient

292
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,530
almost universal for if shown equal to

293
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,900
the Oh over two to the n plus minimum of

294
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,570
empty so it has a beyond diversity bound

295
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,400
version probability so based on these

296
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,700
observations the fruity hash is here so

297
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
as you can see that each message is

298
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,360
divided into + + keep it rocks and you

299
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
can see here that this is the

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,420
xt3 extension using the these two the

301
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,320
years an enduring TBC and this sure yeah

302
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,570
one other place to like plantation and

303
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,720
here's a larger changing this changing

304
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:46,050
scheme of having n + t bit okay and this

305
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,920
is the g hash so and we need to find out

306
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,200
at this value are you to produce the

307
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,000
knocked on and deepen works just simply

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,340
encrypt the you and where you did not

309
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,740
you and we denote the final output of

310
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,380
the d hash here you is n bit and the

311
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,800
weed TV and yeah he has encrypt you with

312
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,859
tweak v twice to produce each n bit

313
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,750
output so just Kim is here and this pure

314
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,930
pure security of defeat easily proved by

315
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,089
previous worsen because this is the

316
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,160
century as a mobile and impart to random

317
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
temptations using a very recent result

318
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,590
by dieter which

319
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,400
as a fifth of this year give me the

320
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,650
prove to have the enemy's security the

321
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:44,929
security bound is this is shown here so

322
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,390
combining all lammers the here's the

323
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,990
security bound of the GMAC and this

324
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,630
shirt that the DFG macro is actually

325
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,480
minimum over in Ypres and in a half of

326
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,710
impressed he beat security secur ok so

327
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,870
in the remaining I've directed the

328
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,169
service da the time it authenticated

329
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:13,470
encryption so other archer already

330
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,990
described the the Dae is a cross a

331
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,330
Boston theater encryption has some

332
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,490
strong security features and the no

333
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,539
mirai e so it's granted the standard

334
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,279
advanced west a security and the

335
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,169
associated data contains a distinct

336
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,659
announced at the encryption but even if

337
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,390
Nancy is repeated over there even known

338
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,380
as the best possible Dae Security is

339
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,510
guaranteed so only the repetition of the

340
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,880
plaintext is leaked and from this

341
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
picture it is also called a misused

342
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,649
resistant ayyy so for building the Dae

343
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:54,750
the following the previous works to be

344
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,760
for the generic a hybrid construction

345
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,010
feature requires the PRF taking the

346
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,870
Associated data and protects em to

347
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,450
protest the tank here and the other

348
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,840
Kidada we also need a London IV based

349
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,789
encryption taking the target and I will

350
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,070
to perform the encryption and the

351
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,490
schemes here we instantiate the PRF by

352
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,010
d'emic with input encoding for the

353
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,679
vector input of a and M associate data

354
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,110
and message and I will based encryption

355
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,159
is instituted by a barrier to the

356
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,409
encryption mode called IP security

357
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:31,679
introduced by parents around 2016 the

358
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
schemes like this one

359
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,019
and this secure the security proof of

360
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,889
the deed easy to get from the previous

361
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,840
security bond over the DMACC and s every

362
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,909
and IV ctlt the bound is here if it is

363
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,179
this better than SCT mode of operation

364
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:58,279
which has a half of NB to da security so

365
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:00,679
for example the Dae with two equal

366
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,950
angles equal to the n has n be to Dae

367
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,880
security okay for the efficiency of Dae

368
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,190
so I mean how many input bit can be

369
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,710
processed bound wipe TBC core inside the

370
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,059
AE is n times n plus T divided by 2 n

371
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,970
plus T so it looks strange but this is

372
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,730
because the Ibis ETA T mode of operation

373
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,059
process and bit input for 1 1 TB Seco

374
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,940
and this figure is always better than in

375
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,700
city used food the exchanges half of n

376
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,240
bits because this city used the P Mac

377
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,500
one format function for example the safe

378
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,289
search of GA is a 2 and over 3 bits for

379
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:49,279
Fante called VM and FN t equal to t 2 n

380
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,309
it is for n over 3 so we also

381
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,159
instantiate GMAC and D using the

382
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,429
dedicated existing TBC and we choose

383
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,950
that the Oxus pc and of skinny rather

384
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,590
the Ox bc the TBC interceder candidate

385
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,529
the Oxus which is the accessory aes best

386
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,850
and the SN 8 can be used to have a very

387
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,279
fast implementation on the modem Intel

388
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,450
and AMD prot Holmes and the skinny has

389
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,539
done a lightweight variant of the 64 or

390
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,169
128 bit Brock TBC introduced at crypto

391
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,470
last year and we abroad TBC performance

392
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,529
and the random tricks and estimated the

393
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,559
performance of that the Mac and Dae with

394
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,529
this performance evaluation of the

395
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,840
underling TVC

396
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,090
for example on inter spider using AES

397
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,120
and I the oxy bc 206 G max runs at one

398
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,080
point 61

399
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,750
and the DA you and at the 1.48 like a

400
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,120
bite and if it showed some 20 to 30

401
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,610
percent to gain from the nod for ID a

402
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,890
motor using the same TVC I'll see the

403
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,380
paper for my details so performance

404
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,510
question I used like to skip this one so

405
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,600
the political impacts in this talk we

406
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,909
propose the GMAC and D are highly

407
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,070
secured and passed to the end Mac and

408
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,590
the DA based on CBC and this shows the

409
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,559
power of the xes like masking we already

410
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,750
see it in the many block cipher modes

411
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,240
like the Pima can also be but d-max

412
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,340
shows it is also powerful in CBC mode

413
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,120
okay so as on the future topics we're

414
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,370
director consider hard applications such

415
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,980
as the nos best a and the even stronger

416
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,559
security achieving the most security

417
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,630
design be to lose also an interesting

418
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,210
direction okay that is thanks for

419
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,900
attention

420
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,679
[Applause]
