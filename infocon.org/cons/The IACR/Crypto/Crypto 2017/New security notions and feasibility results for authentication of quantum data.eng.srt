1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,189
so yeah so this is joint work with soo

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,480
mega Garg and marks andrey so the main

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,090
question that we're going to focus on in

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,330
this talk is what sorts of security

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,960
notions can we expect for message

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,900
authentication in a world with quantum

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,940
adversaries so you know we know that you

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,640
know once quantum computers come online

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,110
we expect to see adversaries with

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,530
enhanced computational capabilities such

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,620
as you know the ability to factor but in

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,390
addition to that these quantum

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,140
adversaries will be able to access and

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,870
interact with quantum with cryptographic

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,149
protocols in a quantum manner something

16
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,179
fundamentally different and you know we

17
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,440
would like to understand what does even

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,190
mean to be secure in such a setting so

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,719
in this work we're going to explore you

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,360
know quote unquote best possible notions

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,220
of security or at least attempt to get

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,549
best possible notions of security and

23
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,399
we're going to give constructions

24
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:16,880
realizing these security definitions and

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,579
for this talk we're going to focus on a

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,549
very basic setting so we're going to

27
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,930
focus on the setting of information

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,200
theoretic security and we're going to

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,250
talk about private key protocols in in

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,079
with where the parties communicate only

31
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,140
once between each other okay and there's

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,240
two parts one is we're gonna focus on

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
protocols that authenticate classical

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,770
messages and then in the second part

35
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,469
we're gonna talk about full-fledged

36
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,590
authentication of quantum data

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,590
okay so authenticating classical

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,979
messages let me focus on message

39
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,140
authentication codes or max okay so

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,590
these are a basic crypto primitive that

41
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,259
ensure message authenticity and

42
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,679
integrity and so let me explain this by

43
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,288
way of example so let's say there's a

44
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,720
bank you know your favorite bank and you

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,820
want to transmit the following message

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,940
end to it you know withdraw $100 from my

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,830
bank account

48
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,750
okay and you'd like to do this in some

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,840
secure and authenticated way so let's

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,260
say you use your bank card and let's

51
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,270
imagine that the bank card shares a

52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,560
random key between itself and the bank

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
so and the random key H you can think of

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,350
as being a random hash function okay so

55
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,600
when you send this message over your

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
bank card will append a hash you know H

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
of M of the message you want to send to

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,720
the bank and when the bank sees this it

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,160
can check that the the tag this H of M

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,230
piece is indeed the hash of the message

61
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,990
it received and it will accept and then

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,650
withdraw $100 from your bank account

63
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,270
okay but what if there's an active

64
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,780
adversary who's trying to corrupt the

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,020
communication from you know yourself to

66
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,840
the bank and instead wants to create an

67
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,730
authentication of some other message and

68
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,920
Prime that you know for example could

69
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,680
say transfer $1,000 to charlie if you

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,010
know say the attacker is name is charlie

71
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,660
and it tries to cook up a bogus

72
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,370
authentication tag T Prime to convince

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,489
the bank to do this well the security

74
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,989
guarantee of of a one-time Mac is that

75
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,880
you know even if the attacker gets to

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,090
choose this original message m and it

77
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,519
sees you know the message tag pair M

78
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,880
comma H of M with high probability it

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,269
should not be able to produce a forgery

80
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,850
and you know a different message tag

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,670
pair

82
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,700
okay so achieving this security

83
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,470
definition is not hard in the classical

84
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,010
setting if H is a pairwise independent

85
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,870
hash function then this gives rise to a

86
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,820
information theoretically secure one

87
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,500
time Mac this is also known as the

88
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,130
Wegman Carter one-time Mac okay and this

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,228
is secure against computationally

90
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,988
unbounded adversaries or classical

91
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,700
adversaries all right and this

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,919
definition can be easily generalized to

93
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,160
the many time setting so let's say you

94
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,560
know this

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,770
smart card is used to authenticate

96
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,780
multiple messages say messages m1 up to

97
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,880
MQ and the attacker gets to see the the

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,880
tenth occations of all of them it still

99
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,000
should not be able to produce a forgery

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,070
you know so long as the number of

101
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,760
queries to the MAC Q is say polynomial

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,500
in some security parameter alright so

103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,940
the question we're interested in is well

104
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,160
what if the adversary has a quantum

105
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,080
computer okay if the interaction between

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,979
all the parties is classical then the

107
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,020
Wegman Carter Mac for example still

108
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,300
remains secure and this is because we

109
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,030
have information theoretic security of

110
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,550
this Mac right so if the interaction is

111
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,850
still classical then the only difference

112
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,810
potentially is that the adversary has

113
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,570
more computational power but as I just

114
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,400
explained this doesn't affect the

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,510
security but on the other hand if the

116
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,990
interaction is quantum then you know we

117
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,490
have to ask ourselves well what is it

118
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,880
what does it mean to be secure okay so

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,090
to explain what quantum interaction is

120
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,890
like I'm going to explain the basics of

121
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,419
quantum information to you guys in one

122
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,510
slide and it's not too hard so the first

123
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,120
thing is you know imagine that you have

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,830
some system that can be in D possible

125
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,960
classical States so for example you have

126
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,000
a bit it can be either on or off these

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,910
are two states quantum mechanics says

128
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,979
that this system the classical States

129
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,450
can be mathematically described by

130
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,580
elementary basis vectors so say state

131
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,880
one is represented by the vector that's

132
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,440
one in the first coordinate and zero

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,840
everywhere else okay

134
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,910
and you know similarly for the other

135
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,690
classical States but more generally this

136
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,450
system can also be a you know in a

137
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,479
quantum state and this is described most

138
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
generally by a complex unit vector in C

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
to the D okay and

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,910
States are you know represented by these

141
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,790
this funny bracket notation but really

142
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,350
all this is it's just some linear

143
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,410
combination of the D basis states and we

144
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,610
have the constraint that all these

145
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,060
coefficients alpha sub I you know

146
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,560
they're complex numbers they can be you

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,410
know positive negative imaginary they

148
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,800
just have to square and sum to one okay

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,840
that's if you have something like this

150
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,510
this is a quantum state and the way to

151
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,850
think about this is that if you have a

152
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,610
system that's described by this state

153
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,060
you can think of it as you know somehow

154
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,120
simultaneously being these classical

155
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,030
States all at the same time but with

156
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,060
these complex weights somehow in the

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,360
background okay and you know how do

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,730
states change over time while they

159
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,260
change over time via linear

160
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,120
transformations that preserve l 2-norm

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,820
also known as unitary matrices so if you

162
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,230
have some quantum state of the system

163
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,380
site and you apply unitary matrix to it

164
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,720
you get another complex unit vector sy

165
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,450
Prime and that's just an another quantum

166
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,720
state okay the last thing is something

167
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,450
called measurement so this is another

168
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,590
thing that can happen to a quantum state

169
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,479
if you have a quantum state sy and you

170
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,090
measure it what you get is a classical

171
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,860
state I whoops with probability alpha I

172
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,050
squared okay and these are probabilities

173
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,729
because they sum to 1 and the important

174
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:20,960
thing to know about measurement is that

175
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,750
once you measure it collapses and you

176
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,640
get a classical state out and all the

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,710
information about the other alpha is

178
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,770
just disappear okay so in this sense

179
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,460
quantum states are fat fragile so here's

180
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,589
an example of a quantum state you've

181
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,080
probably heard of Schrodinger's cat it

182
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,789
can either be alive or dead and but a

183
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,170
possible quantum state of this cat is

184
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,920
the superposition of being dead and

185
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,500
alive where the the coefficients these

186
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,030
alpha is our 1 over square root 2 and

187
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,640
you know it has a coefficient of minus 1

188
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,089
over square root 2 of being

189
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,869
whatever that means okay so now that you

190
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,379
know as much quantum information as I do

191
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,379
we can now think about you know what

192
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,119
can't you know different attack methods

193
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,239
that the attacker can perform so what if

194
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:16,029
the attacker queries your bank card with

195
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,019
a superposition of messages so this is a

196
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,449
we call this a quantum chosen message

197
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,689
attack and what the adversary will do is

198
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,739
just prepare some superposition of

199
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:32,739
classical messages and feed it into the

200
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,129
smart card and the smart card will then

201
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,790
authenticate it in superposition so you

202
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,649
can imagine that now this quantum state

203
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,279
is just you know possibly an exponential

204
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,439
number of messages all authenticated

205
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,439
simultaneously and then the question is

206
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,540
well what can the adversary do with this

207
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,899
quantum state maybe it could perform

208
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,049
some complicated quantum computation on

209
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,110
this state to say extract the secret key

210
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,829
this hash function H okay you know can

211
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,879
this adversary produce a forgery just

212
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,589
from this one quantum superposition

213
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,049
query so this question has been studied

214
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:23,410
before so in 2013 of Bonin's andrey gave

215
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,899
a security definition for this model

216
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,449
where the attacker can make

217
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,819
superposition queries so we say that a

218
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:36,759
Mac is a queue time BeeZee secure if it

219
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,459
can make queue superposition queries to

220
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,179
this Mac yet no matter what it you know

221
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,730
what quantum computation it does

222
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,970
afterwards

223
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,179
it can't produce Q plus one valid

224
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,189
message tag pairs with non-negligible

225
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,829
probability okay so this is a pretty

226
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,519
natural definition of security for

227
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,199
message authentication codes it kind of

228
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,529
lines up with you know the the classical

229
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,459
security definition and you know one

230
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,619
theorem that they proved is if you have

231
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,690
if H is a three

232
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,620
you +1 you know why is independent hash

233
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,440
family this yields a cute I'm busy

234
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,230
secure Mac provided we have some you

235
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,260
know the output ranges of the hash

236
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,550
family is large enough okay so that was

237
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,910
a feasibility results and as Erin

238
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,150
mentioned in in the first talk there are

239
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,070
some negative results showing that

240
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,380
there's some standard message

241
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,540
authentication codes like CBC Mac P Mac

242
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,940
and so on that are that actually failed

243
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,490
to be quantum secure that is there are

244
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,320
quantum superposition attacks that are

245
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:55,770
able to extract the secret key okay so

246
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,960
in our work what we ask is you know so

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,970
that's a very nice definition but can we

248
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,330
demand an even stronger guarantee than

249
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,000
than the bone a xandrie security

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,510
definition so their definition doesn't

251
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,850
rule out the following situation so

252
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,210
let's imagine that the attacker prepares

253
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,250
a superposition over classical messages

254
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,490
where each of these messages M in this

255
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,690
set

256
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,210
you know script M are strings that are

257
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,720
prefixed with say the string Alice okay

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,060
so this superposition gets submitted to

259
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,510
the smart card and it signs all of them

260
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,730
and it returns it to the the adversary

261
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,030
and what the you know the bone a xandrie

262
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,350
definition says is that now this

263
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,300
attacker can't produce you know since it

264
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,280
only made one quantum query it can't

265
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,740
produce to message and you know valid

266
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,720
message tag pairs but it doesn't rule

267
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,030
out producing one message tag pair M

268
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,080
prime H of M prime where M prime now is

269
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,550
a string that starts with Charlie

270
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,570
instead of Alice okay so technically

271
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,060
this isn't oh this is allowed by the BZ

272
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,630
security definition but it somehow seems

273
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,280
you know the somehow this seems like

274
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,860
there's a break in security like how was

275
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,420
this attacker able to produce a valid

276
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,770
forgery

277
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,150
of a message that wasn't even in the

278
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,670
original superposition okay

279
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,430
so we give a security definition that

280
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,890
rules such behavior out at least in the

281
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,070
one-time setting so our security

282
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,620
definition says the following so let's

283
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,750
consider the the real experiments so you

284
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,130
know in this experiment the attacker

285
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,820
will produce an arbitrary superposition

286
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,320
of messages authenticate it and you know

287
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,820
perform some attack and sends this

288
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,770
attack over to the bank okay this is

289
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,670
just what happens in the real protocol

290
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,080
and we would like to compare this with

291
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,860
the ideal experiment in which the

292
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,980
adversary when it first you know before

293
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,570
it does anything it's going to measure

294
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,030
the superposition that it receives from

295
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,530
the smartcard okay and and I put this

296
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,230
powdered wig on this adversary to

297
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,110
indicate that it's acting classically

298
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,170
okay so when it measures what it obtains

299
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,620
is you know remember that I told you

300
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,910
when you measure a quantum state you're

301
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,230
going to get a classical outcome with

302
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,760
some probability and then the

303
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,090
superposition collapses and it will get

304
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,000
M comma H of M with some probability

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,390
alpha M Squared and then based on this

306
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,040
classical outcome it's going to do some

307
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,260
processing it's going to send some state

308
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,240
depending on this mm-hmm

309
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,110
to the bank okay so in essence this is

310
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,900
just a classical attack

311
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,490
and our security definition says your

312
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,850
Mac is epsilon reducible to classical

313
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,190
adversaries if both these views are

314
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,080
epsilon indistinguishable in the

315
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,170
accepting case okay that's what we you

316
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,720
know that's the guarantee that we make

317
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,680
and in included in these views is this

318
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,470
we have a state of the secret key it

319
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,700
includes the message sent to the

320
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,670
receiver and also we also characterize

321
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,250
what happens to the state of the

322
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,170
attackers private memory so this is a

323
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,010
pretty all-encompassing

324
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:46,080
security definition okay all right so so

325
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,090
that's the secure definition now can we

326
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,890
actually achieve it it turns out that we

327
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,610
can if H is a three wise independent

328
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,360
hash family mapping and bits two T bits

329
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,900
then the security of H actually reduce

330
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,270
epsilon reduces to classical adversaries

331
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,100
for absolute exponentially small Epsilon

332
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,340
okay so so this shows you that you know

333
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,800
sort of a you know the most

334
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
straightforward one time Mac that you

335
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,120
would use in the classical setting is

336
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,490
still secure in the quantum setting

337
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,500
because it just forces the adversary

338
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,110
even if it has a quantum computer to act

339
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,150
classically and we already know of

340
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,290
security guarantees in that case

341
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,770
okay so right so a corollary is that you

342
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,100
know the are the Wegman Carter Mac with

343
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,020
three Universal hashing resists

344
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,170
forgeries even against superposition

345
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,640
queries and this recovers the the BZ

346
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,220
security notion for one time max and

347
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,280
sort of more informally you know you can

348
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
ask well what information can the

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,050
adversary learn about the key it this

350
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,610
just reduces to a question of well what

351
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,070
can a classical adversary learn about

352
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:08,900
the key okay and right not very much

353
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,030
okay so so let me point out some

354
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,319
features of our security definition in

355
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,839
some sense it is the best possible

356
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,699
security definition for one time max in

357
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,449
the quantum setting why is that well you

358
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,420
know the adversary can always measure

359
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,840
the the superposition and just pass on

360
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,460
you know once it measures it passes on

361
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,230
the the classical outcome it gets and

362
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,000
this will never be detected by the

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,950
receiver right the receiver all it does

364
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,350
is just you know it gets a message tag

365
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,430
pair and just checks that they're

366
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,940
consistent and if you you know measure

367
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,370
the superposition and pass on a valid

368
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,030
message tag pair the

369
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,730
you know the receivers always going to

370
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,210
accept so you can never rule such an

371
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,090
attack out and what we're saying is this

372
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,190
is the only type of operation that the

373
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,380
adversary can do so you know it gets

374
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,670
this classical outcome and then just

375
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,270
does some processing on its you know on

376
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,740
the message it receives and its own

377
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,520
private space and you know we can never

378
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
rule such a thing out okay so another

379
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,900
feature of our security definition is

380
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,780
that it considers the state of the key

381
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,100
in the view so it it considers the

382
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,050
correlations between all the parties you

383
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,870
know the message is the adversary with

384
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,780
the key and and so in fact our security

385
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,450
definition holds with high probability

386
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,700
over the choice of key all right so

387
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,710
that's that for authenticating classical

388
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,380
messages let me now turn to the quantum

389
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,710
setting where we want to authenticate

390
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,180
you know full-fledged quantum data so so

391
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,760
now all parties possess quantum

392
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,120
computers you know this is in some you

393
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,460
know this is in the future and let's say

394
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,660
Alice and Bob share a secret key and

395
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,370
Alice has some quantum state that she

396
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,600
wants to send to Bob okay and Bob wants

397
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,750
to recover the state and detective any

398
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,000
tampering has happened to this quantum

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,900
state that Alice wanted sentence so in

400
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,790
this protocol Alice will you know try to

401
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,160
encode her quantum state somehow and so

402
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,580
ESI she sends it across the wire and now

403
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,110
the adversary will just perform some

404
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,490
arbitrary quantum attack you know a of

405
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,450
on this encoding and Bob now has to

406
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,980
decide whether to accept or reject and

407
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,260
hopefully if it accepts it produces a

408
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,210
quantum state sigh prime that's close to

409
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:53,090
the original state sigh so what kind of

410
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,430
security guarantees can we hope for in

411
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,890
this setting well we saw in the previous

412
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,470
talk that actually we can hope for quite

413
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,400
a lot

414
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,210
and and so so here's what we can hope

415
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,620
for so you know here's the real

416
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,890
experiment you know they run this some

417
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,309
protocol and we have a secure protocol

418
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,820
if this view is indistinguishable from

419
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,940
the following ideal experiment where

420
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,790
Alice just sends her encoding of her

421
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,590
message straight through and the

422
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,330
adversary doesn't even look at it

423
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,340
and adversary just you know performs

424
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,720
some quantum operation on his own

425
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,730
private memory right he doesn't even

426
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,920
interact with the system okay this is

427
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,559
the ideal experiment and it turns out

428
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,280
all right so our security definition is

429
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,080
that these two views are

430
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,200
indistinguishable in the accepting case

431
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,230
and again included into the view is you

432
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,309
know the message sent to the receiver

433
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,200
the state of the attackers private

434
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,059
memory and also the state of the secret

435
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,150
key okay and this definition extends

436
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,570
previously you know previous definitions

437
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,010
you know the main features that now the

438
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,140
key is also included as part of the view

439
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,179
before the key was just you know these

440
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,760
this indistinguishability statement held

441
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,750
on average over the key okay so first

442
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,670
let me describe what are some

443
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,420
consequences of this security definition

444
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,290
so first this says that if you have a

445
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,270
secure quantum authentication protocol

446
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,330
you've effectively made the attacker

447
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,120
oblivious to the you know the

448
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,870
communication so in in the accept case

449
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,400
the adversary effectively doesn't even

450
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,530
look at the message and this is rather

451
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,290
strong I mean in in the classical world

452
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,059
you can never put you know prevent the

453
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,520
attacker from examining the messages

454
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,010
that are sent across the wire but one

455
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,730
feature of quantum mechanics is that you

456
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,260
know if you try to measure a quantum

457
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,450
state it necessarily disturbs it and

458
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,429
it's this disturbance that hopefully

459
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:15,140
will be detected by the receiver so

460
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,570
you know so that's one thing the other

461
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,030
thing is this definition actually allows

462
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,370
for key recycling so if you look at this

463
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,200
ideal experiment the message just goes

464
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,570
across to Bob and the adversary doesn't

465
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,160
even look at the message so what that

466
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,920
means is that the adversary can't be

467
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,500
correlated with the key because it was

468
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,380
independent to begin with and it's going

469
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,660
to be independent afterwards so that

470
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,940
means in the accept case you can safely

471
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,480
reuse the secret key for some other

472
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,850
protocol in full and and this is

473
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,170
something that again in the classic

474
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,550
world is not possible without

475
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,280
computational assumptions and I also

476
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,620
want to mention that previous works

477
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,510
we're also able to argue that you can

478
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,310
reuse the key in some you know or it

479
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,760
partially reuse the key but here our

480
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,260
security definition says that in fact

481
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:19,640
you can use all of it all right so so

482
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,930
let me mention some constructions that

483
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,930
satisfy this security definition the

484
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,120
previous talk describes the this unitary

485
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,180
design scheme and they showed in fact

486
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,430
that if you use something called unitary

487
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,010
two designs which is like the quantum

488
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,620
analog of pairwise independent hash

489
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,110
function some sense this actually gives

490
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,380
rise to you know quantum secure

491
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,570
authentication scheme I won't talk about

492
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,490
this here I want to talk about another

493
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,790
protocol we give which we call off QFT

494
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,900
off and this is a secure authentication

495
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,870
scheme that actually uses the Wegman

496
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,200
Carter Mac as its building block okay

497
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,940
and you know there's one caveat that it

498
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,920
satisfies a slightly weaker definition

499
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
of security which I'll describe in a

500
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,140
second so this is how it works so let's

501
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,990
say you have a classical Mac and you

502
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,370
just think of the waichman Carter Mac

503
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,100
you know H is like a three wise

504
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,280
independent hash function and so this is

505
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,170
how the the encoding is going to work so

506
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,290
Alice has some quantum states I it's

507
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,500
going to just treat psy as as if it were

508
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,580
a classical message so

509
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,980
applies the Wagner and Carter Mac okay

510
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,040
and then on the resulting state it's

511
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,780
going to apply the quantum Fourier

512
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,370
transform on this state and then after

513
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,050
that it's going to apply another

514
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,940
invocation of the Wegman Carter Mac

515
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,330
using a fresh key H prime right very

516
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,210
simple the coding is just simply the

517
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,490
reverse process the the receiver is just

518
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,290
going to check that you know the outer

519
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,960
authentication tags were consistent with

520
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,660
the message it then performs the inverse

521
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,430
quantum Fourier transform and then

522
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,050
checks that the inner authentication

523
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:09,440
checks out okay it turns out that this

524
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,620
simple authentication scheme is secure

525
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,020
if we don't as long as we don't consider

526
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,770
the second key H Prime okay but aside

527
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,750
from this caveat we have exactly the

528
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,670
same guarantee with high probability if

529
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,010
there's any tampering on this state the

530
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,340
receiver will be able to to detect it

531
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,940
okay all right looks like I'm out of

532
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,320
time so

533
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,690
so let me summarize we give some new

534
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,920
security notions for measures

535
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,620
authentication in the quantum world you

536
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,060
know both for a classical authentication

537
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,100
and quantum authentication we gave some

538
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,219
constructions okay thank you

539
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,690
you
