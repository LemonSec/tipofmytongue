1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,570
and I think the big thing you want to

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,469
know in this conference will be will

3
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:15,279
quantum computers break the internet

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,640
okay and through you know factoring them

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,470
be able to talk new numbers and breaking

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,200
RSA now I'm gonna give you a quantum

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,439
answer to this and the answer is both

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,290
yes and no and the yes is because the

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,329
experimental groups are making real

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,480
progress now and I moved to Google

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,010
because we were able to get some things

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,840
work and we think we know how to scale

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,020
out but the no part is that this was

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,330
really really hard way harder than

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,520
building a classical computer way way

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,110
harder and so you know it if the quantum

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,690
nature of this is actually very

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,910
applicable because this is interesting

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,850
but hard but the only way we're gonna

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,089
know whether we can do it is measure it

21
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,070
okay we're gonna have to build it and

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,140
see how it works and see if we can make

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,390
progress and kind of measure whether

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,969
nature is actually gonna allow this

25
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,590
there's no fundamental reasons I think

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,359
we can't do it but there are lots of

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,219
practical things we have the butt up

28
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,859
against and I'm also gonna say and you

29
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,200
guys in a crypto conference knows it's

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,030
way better than I do is that we I don't

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,950
know everything that's going on there's

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,229
a lot of things going on in secret and

33
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,590
we don't know everything so there's a

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,670
level of uncertainty there and so what

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,310
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna try to

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,880
tell you enough about how this thing

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,130
works that you can kind of make up your

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,889
own mind to some degree what's going on

39
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:54,229
and then this thing's progress in the

40
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,810
future and read things and the news you

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,999
might be able to you know tell the

42
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,880
difference what's going on so I'll talk

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,729
about all these things here quantum

44
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,759
computing how an error correction what a

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,220
factoring dishmachine gonna look like a

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,030
hundred million to billions of qubits

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,069
okay that's not as many as in here

48
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,439
okay but right now we're doing

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,219
experiments it can okay so you know can

50
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,030
we get there

51
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,340
that's the question some general

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,109
comments in the end and then hopefully

53
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,749
I'll have time for a lot of Q&A I'm sure

54
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,209
there's a lot of questions here okay so

55
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,849
why is quantum computing so interesting

56
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,189
normally we think of bits it's either in

57
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,129
the 0 or the 1 state in quantum

58
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,430
computing it can be both 0 and 1 and the

59
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,319
advantage of this is you can basically

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,719
run through your quantum computer the

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,169
case of 0 in the case of 1 at the same

62
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,709
time in a parallel computation ok that

63
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,959
gives you a factor 2 that's really great

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,659
but by itself not that interesting but

65
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,120
of course what's interesting is you then

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
put in two qubits and that now runs

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,439
through 4 states 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 which

68
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,109
is double the number 4 - could you add

69
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,930
one cubit you double the states so in

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,689
three cubits that's eight states for

71
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,959
qubits 16 states scales exponentially

72
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,079
the parallelism and that's interesting

73
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,989
because by the time we're at 50 cubits

74
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,840
that amount of parallelism is kind of

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,489
the size of the memory of a

76
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,229
supercomputer and we're actually

77
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,199
thinking of doing experiments starting

78
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,620
this year to be testing this kind of

79
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,069
thing

80
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,939
competing our qubits against the

81
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,620
supergirl least have the supercomputer

82
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,650
check it's not doing anything useful yet

83
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,519
at 300 to the 300s is more States than

84
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,060
there are and atoms in the universe and

85
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,120
clearly even Google is not gonna be able

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,009
to do something like that and clearly

87
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,609
anyone can't do that ok so that's the

88
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:08,669
idea and then of course a big thing is

89
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,069
to shore algorithm and the shore

90
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,379
algorithm takes a few thousand what

91
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,380
we're gonna call logical qubits and

92
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,149
basically we start out with a bunch of

93
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,608
qubits in the 0 plus 1 state so this

94
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,370
huge parallelism going on and then you

95
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,570
do your arithmetic computation where you

96
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,580
you modularly

97
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,100
modulo a

98
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,780
exponentiate all these different

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,100
different numbers and then to find the

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,500
factor and when you modulae exponentiate

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,930
it there's a algorithm because Euler's

102
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,870
invented it where there's going to be a

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,020
periodic repeat of the numbers again and

104
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,449
to find that tome to find that frequency

105
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,509
we do a quantum Fourier transform and we

106
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,400
do the period finding and then you could

107
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,220
figure out what the factors are okay

108
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,690
that's all I'm gonna say about that

109
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,560
because this is the easy part a building

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,940
a quantum mechanics although it's

111
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,240
beautiful theorem and beautiful result

112
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,530
and only takes a few thousand cubits

113
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,500
okay this is actually really hard to

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,410
build okay and the reason is is you're

115
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,630
doing a bunch of arithmetic operations

116
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,449
and the number of operations it's kind

117
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,610
of typical to what you might find in a

118
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,400
cell phone application but these are

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,430
done with quantum bits and quantum bits

120
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,220
are not stable like classical computing

121
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,099
okay this is stable you know how it's

122
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,729
gonna work it's great quantum bits are

123
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,560
fundamentally unstable and you have to

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,930
deal with that at the very fundamental

125
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,000
level and that's what we're doing right

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,190
now we're doing experiments the world's

127
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,780
doing the experiments they're doing that

128
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,479
and you need to understand how hard it

129
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,900
is to do error correction to know

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,810
whether this algorithm will ever be B

131
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,780
that is neither so let me explain a

132
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,870
little bit about quantum why there's

133
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,389
errors and in quantum quantum systems

134
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,930
and I'm gonna use the example of storing

135
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,050
information of a coin okay as a clevis

136
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,900
to a classical bit and of course you

137
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,490
know who has coins in their pockets

138
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,680
anymore so everyone has a cell phone so

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,050
treat this as a coin and I'm gonna treat

140
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,419
this as a classical bit lying on a table

141
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,740
say where it facing up is a zero and

142
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,490
facing down is a one okay now this zero

143
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,710
or one state is very stable

144
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,560
I can jiggle this around and this states

145
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,690
not going to flip over and I can in fact

146
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,630
jiggle it hard so it's robust against

147
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,910
errors and of course what happens is

148
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,280
there's a forceful Lina down and if it

149
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,080
does happen to pop up a little bit

150
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,270
there's some dissipation in the system

151
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,520
that keeps it either the zero one as

152
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,220
long as you don't jiggle it force it too

153
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,620
much so classical information is

154
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,810
inherently stable so you can make

155
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,040
devices with very very low error rates

156
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,350
now in quantum information it you don't

157
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,780
have that stability anymore so think

158
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,240
about this coin just kind of floating in

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,640
space and the way to think about it

160
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,310
again this is zero and this is one

161
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,340
but rotated 90 degrees pointing this way

162
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,610
is zero plus one and in fact there can

163
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,650
be a complex phase so this is zero plus

164
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,230
one zero plus I 1 0 minus 1 0 minus I 1

165
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,880
and that's kind of how quantum mechanics

166
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,130
work in fact there's a very good analogy

167
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,070
of it's called the Bloch sphere and

168
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,610
block vector between information

169
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,440
classical information and quantum

170
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,360
information quantum information just

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,010
lives in this 3d space ok now you have

172
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,170
this and you have this in some state

173
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,080
just a single qubit and you can see now

174
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,270
than any little force on this is going

175
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,000
to kanawa cause this to rotate and give

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
you some kind of error okay there's

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,100
nothing holding it in in some particular

178
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,530
direction and this makes it

179
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,160
intrinsically unstable and it's kind of

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
worse than that when you go through the

181
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,419
quantum physics and you can say whoa K

182
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,450
can I measure it somehow and any kind of

183
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,880
measurement here it turns out with

184
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,740
quantum mechanics it's basically coming

185
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,740
from the uncertainty principle any kind

186
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,720
of measurement that tells you it's zero

187
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,530
or oneness so this direction puts error

188
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,289
in this direction and any kind of error

189
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,320
to know the phase in this direction

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,059
causes it to become uncertain in this

191
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,280
direction you can't kind of measure both

192
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,020
those quantities you can measure if it's

193
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,900
0 or 1 to get an answer but by doing

194
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,970
that you just don't have any information

195
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,850
in that

196
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,709
direction and that means you know any

197
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,199
kind of attempt by itself to try to

198
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,230
stabilize this is doomed for failure you

199
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,569
know you're gonna introduce errors so

200
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,529
that looks pretty bad and the beautiful

201
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,290
part is is you know you measure an

202
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,660
through rather phase and vice versa the

203
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,230
beautiful part is if you take two qubits

204
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,410
and then go ahead and measure their

205
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,589
parity so you measure the two of these

206
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,860
but measure their total parity it turns

207
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,190
out that you can measure their total

208
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,370
parity amplitude or parity phase without

209
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,500
screwing up the amplitude screwed up

210
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,720
phase or phase screwed up amplitude this

211
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,899
is not it's just very strange and I'm

212
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,790
gonna have to show you some quantum

213
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,649
mathematics to to explain that so the

214
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,079
the way this works in quantum mechanics

215
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,389
to try to figure out if one's gonna

216
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,449
other you have to do what these operator

217
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,490
algebra they have very upper weird

218
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,100
operator algebra where if you flip the

219
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
bit and then flip the phase that's

220
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,630
differently than flipping the phase and

221
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,569
flipping the bit so let me do that do

222
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,730
the thing I have this in the zero state

223
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,639
and I'm gonna flip the bit by rotating

224
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,189
it over and then flip the face and then

225
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,019
I have the cellphone pointing in that

226
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,420
direction and then if I'm gonna take

227
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,269
this and flip the phase and then flip

228
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,149
the bit I'm claiming it's in another

229
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,279
it's in another state however you

230
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,930
probably couldn't see this but in both

231
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,540
cases I have the top of this pointing

232
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,329
towards you so classically you would say

233
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,850
well it's it's the same but in fact it's

234
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,250
not okay and the way to do the

235
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,939
mathematics is just just right here it's

236
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,480
simple mathematics a bit flip turns a 0

237
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
into 1 and 1/2 to 0 and the phase flip

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,939
puts a 1 puts a minus sign instead of

239
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,860
the 1 so let's just start with the state

240
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,220
0 plus 1 okay we do a bit flip that's 1

241
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,740
plus 0 we do a phase flip and there's a

242
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,939
minus sign here 0 plus 1 do a phase flip

243
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,870
that 0 minus 1 and then

244
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,589
do a bit flip and that's 1-0 note that

245
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,290
this is the - of this it's not the same

246
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,050
state that minus sign has important

247
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,900
implications in quantum mechanics okay

248
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,070
so this this bit then phase is not the

249
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,070
same as phase and flip and in fact it's

250
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,110
and this gives you the quantum mechanics

251
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,750
behavior okay that's what you need but

252
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,880
notice it's what we call an e commute

253
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,089
there's a minus sign here so here's the

254
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,060
trick the trick is we measure parody's

255
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,540
okay so we're gonna do now we're gonna

256
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,350
talk about flipping two bits X 1 and X 2

257
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,200
take two quantum bits flip both of the

258
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,080
the amplitude or flip both of the phases

259
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,260
and now we're gonna see if this this

260
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,900
commutes if the order matters so I'm

261
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,470
going to write this out X 1 to Z 1 to Z

262
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,290
1 to X 2 and now I'm gonna flip the X

263
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,839
and Z's here using this relationship and

264
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,570
I get a minus sign here and a minus sign

265
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,510
here and because of the very complex

266
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,140
mathematics of minus squared is equal to

267
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,350
+1 I think you can handle that

268
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,690
ok these this is the same as this and

269
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,370
it's 0 okay what this means this is

270
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,430
really cool this means that if you worry

271
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,820
about the parodies of quantum bits okay

272
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,950
which are very familiar it's phase and

273
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,900
AM through weird but the parodies of

274
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,770
quantum bits because it commute it Bay's

275
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,050
completely classically so all of your

276
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,990
classical intuition can be used for

277
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,940
example about ill building error

278
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,250
correction codes and then people in

279
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,350
quantum error correction codes have used

280
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,420
all these ideas of classical error

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,060
correction to build up some way to do it

282
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,950
with the caveat that you have to be

283
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,760
dealing with parodies and not and and

284
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,470
you know and not any other thing you

285
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,240
have to always deal with parodies okay

286
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,750
so you can use your classical intuition

287
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,930
it's pretty cool that way oops so what

288
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,089
I'm gonna do okay is now what happens

289
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,130
the fact that it commutes means that if

290
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,520
you have

291
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,490
two bits okay one and two and you

292
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,130
measure this phase parity and then the

293
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,280
bit flip parity you're gonna measure it

294
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,410
over and over again because one is not

295
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,180
going to screw up the other which I said

296
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,490
the quantum mechanics does however at

297
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,130
some point here let's say this plus one

298
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,500
goes to the minus one you're gonna say

299
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,060
aha I detected an error okay now of

300
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,100
course you obviously see you know that

301
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,950
one of the qubits was an error which one

302
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,010
okay you can't tell from just two so the

303
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,650
way to tell to do is now you have three

304
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,710
qubits and again if you're doing parity

305
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,630
error chucking you know all this this is

306
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,690
what you do you have three cubits now

307
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,390
you have a z1 to parity measurement and

308
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,210
a Z 2 3 parity measurements and let's

309
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,040
say you start these all in the zero

310
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,590
state and the parity of course is zero

311
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,770
zero now if one of these qubits changes

312
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,180
you have a neat unique decoding with the

313
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,970
parodies so if it's one zero it's the

314
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,040
left qubit if it's one one it's the

315
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,410
middle if it's zero one its right so you

316
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,040
can decode it okay now of course if

317
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,160
there are two errors between the fact

318
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,260
that you do the parity every Mint's down

319
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,620
here then when you decode one zero and

320
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,180
you think it's one zero zero you're

321
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,770
gonna get the bit opposite so you're

322
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,520
decoding will be an error okay and

323
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,310
that's bad so how do we get around that

324
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,560
how do we make sure that if there

325
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,740
happened to be two errors we won't

326
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,620
decode okay and the obvious thing is you

327
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,750
just don't make three qubits you make

328
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,660
four cubits or five cubits or six cubits

329
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,080
you keep on adding up so that in order

330
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,330
and so then with with four cubits and

331
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,980
three parodies you'll be able to correct

332
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,780
for one and two qubit errors but not

333
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,210
three and then you add more qubits and

334
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,310
you can do lower errors and then at some

335
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,920
point it's just gonna be so unlikely

336
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,410
that you can you're gonna have 10 or 20

337
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,740
errors okay that you can say you can

338
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,990
correct for them all okay that's the

339
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,120
standard way this is this is this is all

340
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,680
classical I'm not telling you anything

341
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,420
anything new here now this is

342
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,200
four string of qubits for the the Z

343
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,930
that's a bit flip errors what do we do

344
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,000
with a quantum circuit we have both bit

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,120
and phase and it turns out what you do

346
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,100
is instead of a one dimensional four

347
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,980
like bit errors what you do is you make

348
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,190
a two dimensional circuit and

349
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,639
essentially One Direction is bit and one

350
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,910
direction is phase okay that's the basic

351
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,410
idea when you have to work it out and

352
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,149
carefully that's good enough for now and

353
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,750
then instead of two bit parodies we

354
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,779
actually do four bit parodies both in

355
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,470
terms of X and burns of Z okay and then

356
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,060
from this you can figure out what's

357
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,550
going on so for example you're running

358
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,160
this thing and then in in this

359
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,860
particular parody measurement here there

360
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,260
was a change in parody which said that

361
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,500
one of these four cubits screwed up and

362
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,870
then let's say at the same time we also

363
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,570
saw a change in parody of this one which

364
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,029
says one of these four screwed up and

365
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,149
the natural decoding would be it's the

366
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,540
shared one right here so you you qubit

367
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,910
errors identified which kind of adjacent

368
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,589
parity measurements they come in pairs

369
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,860
and in fact one can do some kind of

370
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,959
minimum weight matching because it comes

371
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,750
in pairs for very complex patterns and

372
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,250
it's very efficient and you can build

373
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,130
software to do that okay and then of

374
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,170
course as before what happens when you

375
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,019
have lots and lots of errors then you're

376
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,060
gonna decode it in some way and you

377
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,720
could be an error okay and basically the

378
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,369
error goes as how Agera gets less as you

379
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,500
make this bigger and bigger like I said

380
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,349
before according if this is dimension D

381
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:19,319
it goes has some number to the D plus

382
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,500
one over two and as you make big D

383
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,270
bigger this gets to be bigger and bigger

384
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,549
so it's exponentially suppressed and

385
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,910
this is the key thing is that in order

386
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,890
for this to get bigger as you make it

387
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,460
better the physical error rate has to be

388
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,980
below about 1% okay or else it just

389
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,570
doesn't get any bigger so there's a

390
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,220
threshold and I think and

391
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,200
well error correction codes there are I

392
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,210
think similar kind of thresholds again

393
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,440
this is nothing new

394
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,960
okay and it just says you have to make

395
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,080
good cubits okay that are better than

396
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,570
you typically less than one percent

397
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,700
error per operation that's not easy but

398
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,070
you can do it and then if you make it

399
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,860
bigger and bigger you can do it so

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,049
typically we're gonna try to shoot for

401
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,970
about 0.1% error

402
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,210
so that's lambdas 10 so if we make this

403
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,850
10th order this logical error would be

404
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,179
10 to minus 10 and then yeah we could do

405
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,299
something okay but you can see if it's

406
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,309
at an Fitz's square ray there's a lot of

407
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,380
cubits okay but that's what you that's

408
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,730
the basic idea here okay

409
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,370
so this is just this is the just

410
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,809
applauded or how many qubits you need

411
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,570
here's a 1% error you want to be below

412
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,130
that and then what we want to do is we

413
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,530
want 10 to minus 10 to 10 to minus 20

414
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,130
errors okay and that requires an order

415
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,710
20 or 30 and that's going to require

416
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,350
about a thousand physical qubits so you

417
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,320
need a lot of qubits ok so it's just

418
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,679
what what you need to do to do this and

419
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,240
people are working on it to understand

420
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,539
it better and making better qubits want

421
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,429
to make better qubits and we want to

422
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,409
maybe make better codes and get this

423
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:10,620
number down but you know that's that's

424
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,990
the idea okay so we have make a lot of

425
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,150
qubits okay

426
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,890
so I want to talk about what will

427
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,710
factoring machine look like so it's

428
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,039
gonna be big and scary but I just want

429
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,320
it you know get you thinking about this

430
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,400
is a hard problem

431
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,669
what would a classical factoring machine

432
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,070
look like just knowing what we do now

433
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,840
looking at technology

434
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,470
so I'm classical factoring of 2048 bits

435
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,919
you have a data center right here big

436
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,440
data center and it's gonna be the size

437
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
of you know good fraction in North

438
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,120
America and excuse me for our Canadian

439
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,190
friends I put it up there because

440
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,280
there's natural cooling going on to make

441
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,590
it easier and you see there's even a

442
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,190
little pipeline to Prudhoe

443
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,340
they make it easier on you and I'm sorry

444
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,680
for the polar bears but but they're

445
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,030
gonna like it because there's gonna be a

446
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,760
lot of people to eat okay

447
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,730
so if you did it this size it would be

448
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,210
about a 10-year runtime okay and cost

449
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,100
maybe it'll be a little bit less because

450
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,980
of scaling but pretty expensive I think

451
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,870
the real problem is it's gonna consume

452
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,970
all of the Earth's energy in about a day

453
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,430
so I'm gonna say you just don't want to

454
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,830
build that thing okay so this is much

455
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,960
more reasonable okay so we have a

456
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,130
quantum computer

457
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,490
a hundred million for the

458
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,370
superconducting qubits and that's gonna

459
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,420
factor a number in about 24 hours if you

460
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,980
were to make it

461
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,800
oops if you were to make it a hundred

462
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,780
billion it'll be about a thousand times

463
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,420
faster there are other qubits that are

464
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,160
slower and they're gonna need billions

465
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,260
of billions of qubits to make this thing

466
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,160
fast okay so it's hard okay and you know

467
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,470
some big refrigerator with all this

468
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,650
stuff you know lots of money the power

469
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,290
whatever it's gonna be hard okay but

470
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,360
okay maybe you know it's not it's not

471
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,420
the North America okay so let's talk

472
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,280
about encoding of the quantum bits

473
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,890
physical encoding you naturally would

474
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,810
think about well let's use atoms you

475
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,900
take the hydrogen atom you have the

476
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,240
various orbitals the 1s ground state

477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,540
there's some two states that are s and P

478
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,630
you'd probably encode it in terms of 0

479
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,060
as being that this hydrogen atom and one

480
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,310
is this item gentlemen this is a stable

481
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,680
state but this state will decay but it

482
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,630
decays kind of slowly so that would be

483
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,670
okay and then you would put light

484
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,400
between these two frequencies here to

485
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,620
cause it to the change between zero and

486
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,840
one and then you want to interact them

487
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,700
together so you're gonna make some kind

488
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,090
of molecule and the natural interactions

489
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,670
are gonna do something here okay so let

490
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,230
me tell you what the problem is with

491
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,810
here is that if you build some kind of

492
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,760
molecule the problem is you come with

493
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,280
the light the light is about a thousand

494
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,290
times bigger than these atoms so how you

495
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,860
knit come

496
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,710
in light and effect that a demand not

497
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,870
the one next door to it okay that's

498
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,910
gonna be really hard and it's a

499
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,090
technological problem okay it's just so

500
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,000
atoms are so darn small you know how you

501
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,610
gonna build a complex system out of that

502
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,860
I know with electronics we want to make

503
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,299
them smaller and smaller but it gets

504
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,299
really hard so what people do physicists

505
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,150
do is they make big atoms they put ions

506
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,370
that are a micron apart that still talk

507
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,100
to each other they build neutral atoms

508
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,840
that are in some kind of light lattice

509
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,150
where they can talk to each other and

510
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,040
you can still manipulate them there's a

511
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,960
lot of clever things that are going on

512
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,590
what we do is we build integrated

513
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,780
circuits we call them quantum integrated

514
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,150
circuits in this case if they're out of

515
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,429
superconducting metal aluminum they're

516
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,910
not too hard to make their big size okay

517
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,880
this is a hundred micron think scale and

518
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,820
this is the light here is the aluminum

519
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,220
that gets reflected and where dark is

520
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,049
where the aluminum has been etched away

521
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,870
and basically these are just microwave

522
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,400
oscillators this little square here

523
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,220
forms a capacitance between the cross

524
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,650
and the ground and then this is a little

525
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,720
Josephson Junction nonlinear inductor

526
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,450
and you basically have an inductor

527
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,419
capacitor resonator at six gigahertz

528
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,450
that forms our qubit and they have

529
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,220
special quantities that look like a

530
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,580
quantum system but in the end that and

531
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,549
in particular you have the current

532
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,470
that's flowing between the ground plane

533
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,940
and the center island through these

534
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,190
Johson junctions that's in the wave

535
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,179
function that's both going up and down

536
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:48,610
at the same time in a quantum wave

537
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,679
function in the same way that this

538
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,410
electron is up here and down here at the

539
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,750
same time that's the quantum but the big

540
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,169
thing here is this is relatively easy to

541
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,120
control because it's a large size here

542
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,799
are little wires that come in they're

543
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,020
way smaller than this you can bring them

544
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,840
in you can print this with an integrated

545
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,710
circuit fabrication not too hard okay so

546
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,020
let's just talk of just about how qubit

547
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,590
operation is what we do is we just let

548
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,030
this relax to the ground

549
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,210
date so we're in the zero state and then

550
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,620
what we're gonna do is we're going to

551
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,870
put on some microwaves that are resonant

552
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,880
with this oscillation frequency and

553
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,250
that's gonna cause a 0 to 1 transition

554
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,010
and then back to zero again it's gonna

555
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,220
cause this state to rotate okay like

556
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,570
like that and then after a certain

557
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,020
amount of time which is known we then

558
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,030
measure whether it's a 0 or 1 and we get

559
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,980
a 0 or 1 then we have to repeat it about

560
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,530
a thousand times to get a probability so

561
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,710
this is a plot of the probability versus

562
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,930
the time of the microwaves for a fixed

563
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,200
power and you see you start here at 0 at

564
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,050
probability 0 1 and then at 40

565
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,590
nanoseconds it goes to a 1 state and

566
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,470
then another 40 nanoseconds it goes back

567
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,780
to the zero state so 40 now in the

568
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,720
seconds is a 0 state going to a 1 state

569
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
and if you remember from your boolean

570
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,850
logic that's a not gate and then another

571
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,660
40 nanoseconds takes it back to the zero

572
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,880
state and we know from Barrett boolean

573
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,060
logic that a naught times R naught is

574
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,610
equal to the identity which is what we

575
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,180
see however we can do things egg pulse

576
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,000
it for 20 nanoseconds which takes a 0

577
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,800
state in fact to a 0 plus 1 okay and if

578
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,440
you do 20 nanoseconds and 20 nanoseconds

579
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,810
you get to a naught so that you're gonna

580
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,350
call a square root and not gate and the

581
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,260
algebra gets obeyed and anyway so I

582
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,030
understand if you have classical

583
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,950
intuition about what a not gate is you

584
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,630
have no idea what a square would or not

585
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,540
but it turns out the quantum dynamics of

586
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,260
this you can find a very nice algebraic

587
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,360
form that to describe it where

588
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,820
everything is is very precise and you

589
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,160
know exactly what's going on in fact you

590
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,010
can form these continuous gates which is

591
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,200
what you need for the quantum system so

592
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,330
you see this is doing it's not Enid's

593
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,190
doing all this things versus a various

594
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,230
amount of times you start seeing this as

595
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,810
pulls away a little bit from 0 and 1 and

596
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,410
these are the decoherence effects and

597
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,080
basically the lifetime of this qubit is

598
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,570
around 10 or 20 micro second so we can

599
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,150
do about a

600
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,000
thousand operations before it kind of

601
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
loses its memory but we can get that to

602
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,690
work pretty well so I'm just gonna show

603
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,250
you some simple results where we did

604
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,950
this quantum error correction but making

605
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,220
it for the full 2d array was really hard

606
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,380
we're gonna start attempting at the end

607
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,630
of this year next year that's it's

608
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,880
doable but it was just too hard couple

609
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,890
years ago so we just did a linear chain

610
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,100
and we're gonna do the measure the qubit

611
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,230
Barrett parity over and over detect

612
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,810
eclipses it's a realistic test of a

613
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,240
surface code kind of simple though and

614
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,820
then we wanted to say is it possible to

615
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,550
left with extend the lifetime by doing

616
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,640
this that was the big question okay so

617
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,220
here are the nine cubits you see the X's

618
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,380
like we had before the control lines are

619
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,420
coming in the bottom and then these

620
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,580
little microwave resonators are what

621
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,710
we're gonna use to measure it and we

622
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,690
bring in microwave tones and we measure

623
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,850
the reflected phase coming out of all

624
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,130
the qubits to know their States I didn't

625
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,610
go into that it's so complicated but you

626
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,590
can build up the chip here's the chip in

627
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,630
aluminum mount with a bunch of microwave

628
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,090
connector is coming out of it this is an

629
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,220
a dilution refrigerator at 10

630
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,310
millikelvin because we want the thermal

631
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,520
energy which the K Boltzmann bi T to be

632
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,770
much much less than the quantum energy

633
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,290
which is h-bar Omega so you have to go

634
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,420
to low temperatures at 6 gigahertz fine

635
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,030
it's just something we buy ok we have a

636
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,800
bunch of filters and this is all done

637
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,010
done right and then that's down here and

638
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,830
you bring up all the wires to a rack of

639
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,370
a control electronics and then we sit

640
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,350
here and program for days and days to

641
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,210
figure out how to get this thing to work

642
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,730
so so I like this picture because it

643
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,340
looks staged and you can tell that

644
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,890
because the lab is so clean it's

645
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,240
normally okay so okay we we do this

646
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,920
experiment I just want to say there's a

647
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,930
bunch of complicated waveforms of

648
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,730
microwaves putting in or whatever we

649
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,860
a bunch of cubits we do this over and

650
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,990
over again this is a complicated

651
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,570
sequence kind of starting to look like a

652
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,510
real digital circuit okay not as

653
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,000
complicated as this but it is kind of

654
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,070
complex and we can get it to work very

655
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,460
well okay and this is just the basic

656
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,850
idea about showing how it it's going

657
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:08,880
this is we repeat these these parity

658
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,740
measurements over and over again eight

659
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,830
cycles and if we don't do anything to

660
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,200
the qubits they relax in about 30

661
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,740
microseconds given here but if we do the

662
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,110
error correction protocol and measure

663
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,960
errors and we can correct for it if it's

664
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
five qubits which is only corrects for

665
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,270
first-order that's the blue line here

666
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,299
and then if we use nine cubits the whole

667
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,970
sequence and correct for first and

668
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,490
second order errors that's right here

669
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,330
and indeed we see that things get better

670
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,510
and in fact it's the difference between

671
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,700
first-order and second-order that tells

672
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,890
you what that lamb the factor is that I

673
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,040
mentioned earlier it's about 3.2 and it

674
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,950
says did you make it bigger the errors

675
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,950
go down and down so that in principle if

676
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,320
we were to just add more and more qubits

677
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,010
to this we could make the error

678
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,540
exponentially small okay and in fact

679
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,100
that's one of the things we're trying to

680
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,580
do now is make this much much bigger so

681
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,710
that we can make the error rates error

682
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,270
rates lower so this number this

683
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,790
improvement here really shows that at

684
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,220
least just four bit flips ok this linear

685
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,740
chain things are working well ok that is

686
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,240
kind of the state of the art I mean

687
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,340
other people are doing error correction

688
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,770
and there's a bunch of other experiments

689
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,540
but kind of doing it in a way that

690
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,220
really simulates the full error

691
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,360
correction that's that's pretty good ok

692
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,830
people have done some other things

693
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,660
proven to other things but you know

694
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,880
we're at a very rudimentary stage and

695
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,049
we're working to make it better so in in

696
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,970
talking about the future I want to

697
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,740
mention couple things that we're doing

698
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,010
is besides trying to get error

699
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,259
correction

700
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:00,859
we want to do some tests on our qubits

701
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,259
and we want to both make the qubits

702
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,839
better and make more of them there's an

703
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,389
experiment we're doing right now okay so

704
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:11,179
first of all let's talk about the

705
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,899
exponential complexity that's how you

706
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:17,059
said in the beginning the computation

707
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,099
power the parallel computation power

708
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:21,679
goes exponentially with the number of

709
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,379
qubits that's parallel state space we're

710
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,509
looking at is to the end that's the

711
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,229
basis of her all this we all believe

712
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:32,299
this is true all the physicists believe

713
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,089
quantum mechanics but this has not

714
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,129
really been tested experimentally yet

715
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:40,609
and right now there are I'm gonna say

716
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,149
three billion dollar government programs

717
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,549
looking at quantum information and more

718
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:49,369
money than that doing that and we're

719
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,099
spending billions of dollars and we

720
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:56,899
don't even know if this this idea that

721
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,899
the state space grows exponentially is

722
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,330
correct or how correct it is we're all

723
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,879
assuming it's gonna be correct so we

724
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:07,999
know it for about let's say 10 cubits to

725
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,639
a state space of a thousand okay which

726
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,989
is good but will it go to to the 50 or

727
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:17,899
to their 300 we don't know yet so one of

728
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,320
the experiments we want to do is

729
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,349
demonstrate this exponentially growing

730
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:27,859
computational space you just you have to

731
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,779
do more qubits but they have to be cubed

732
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,399
and we're gonna do that through a

733
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,460
quantum supremacy experiment that was

734
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,769
kind of motivated by John Prescott at

735
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:39,499
Caltech so for a well-defined problem

736
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,149
we're gonna show her more computation

737
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:43,460
powerful qubits basically we're going to

738
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,119
run a 50 qubit experiment and check and

739
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,859
we have to check where the outputs right

740
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:52,399
by doing a supercomputer calculation to

741
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,830
do that you need good fidelity like I've

742
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,869
been talking about here for doing error

743
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:59,739
correction in fact you need about 0.1%

744
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:03,469
errors per gate and that's good because

745
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:05,779
that way we can validate our control and

746
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,549
then go ahead and and build a

747
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:08,340
general-purpose

748
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,260
a quantum computer with error correction

749
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,020
so so we're working on this and we think

750
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,330
there's some interesting thing so here's

751
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,390
here's a chip we have in here I'll show

752
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,870
you the latest hardware this is the chip

753
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,909
right here that we talked about before

754
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,450
now there's two rows of eleven qubits so

755
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,059
it's that's eleven by two and that's a

756
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,890
chip and then we take that chip and

757
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,960
there little endian bump ons in

758
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,000
little-endian ten microns spheres

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,120
essentially on here and here and then

760
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,640
that chip gets flipped over and does a

761
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,580
bump on press against this which is our

762
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,370
wiring chip that brings the wires out to

763
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,770
the edges of the chip and then that's

764
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,840
brought here and then we wire bond to a

765
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,059
circuit board and to a bunch of

766
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,309
connectors that go up to our electronics

767
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:01,140
so we're at 22 qubits right now and you

768
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,090
know we bring up a bunch of microwave

769
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,850
lines and then we bring them down to a

770
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,849
bunch of electronics and this is a crate

771
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:12,359
that's gonna control about 20 cubits 22

772
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:15,510
qubits or so so if we want to do you

773
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,300
know you go look at a high energy

774
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,239
physics experiment we can build you know

775
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,520
racks and racks of electronics so we

776
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,949
feel we can scale up the way more than

777
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,830
22 if things work right and and we know

778
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,389
what we're doing okay so I'm near the

779
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,960
end so you want to go away you know

780
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,460
hopefully you've learned something about

781
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,409
this and you're going to want to judge

782
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,760
whether our field is making progress and

783
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,060
there's a big problem and the problem is

784
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,429
fake news okay no surprise just to give

785
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,250
you an example when we did the showing

786
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,530
the mechanical oscillator showed quantum

787
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,260
mechanics the headline on one of the

788
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,230
news organizations was physicists show

789
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,380
time travel

790
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,670
okay but I would say most of the time

791
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,450
it's pretty good but the problem and in

792
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,460
what happens in our field right now

793
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,979
you're trying to build systems which is

794
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:19,970
really cool

795
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,079
systems that work and the journalist and

796
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,940
then this this makes sense the journal

797
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,529
was kind of think of this as a horse

798
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:30,039
race who's ahead what are people doing

799
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,529
you know whatever and the natural way to

800
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,859
think about a horse race is to say well

801
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:39,229
what's the number of qubits okay and

802
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:41,450
that makes sense because you know when

803
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,130
you talk about some person views

804
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,739
something here you want to know how much

805
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,440
gram it does and how many CPU so it's a

806
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,170
it's clear what the metric is but that's

807
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,779
that's totally wrong because this thing

808
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,019
we all know is a hundred percent

809
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,609
reliable in terms of the computation

810
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,880
where in qubits and just one thing you

811
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,440
learn from this is the qubits are

812
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,559
intrinsically error-prone and you have

813
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,619
to deal with that so I think the right

814
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,359
way if you want to get a little we're

815
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,190
building systems is very complicated

816
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,809
it's more than two things but if you

817
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:18,140
really want to simplify that the problem

818
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,539
is it's a two dimensional horse race

819
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:23,089
where there's obviously the number of

820
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,130
qubits but you need to know what the

821
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,900
qubit error is two because that's

822
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,049
something that's not zero okay that's

823
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:31,849
some finite number so you have to be

824
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,130
tracking this and you have to be very

825
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,499
careful on this axis because the

826
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:39,380
physicists will tell you their best

827
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,900
error rate okay because they're proud of

828
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,109
it but if you build systems for a living

829
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,390
you know it's the worst error that

830
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,069
always kills you and you spend all your

831
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:51,349
time doing that and that generally is

832
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,299
how two qubits interact I didn't talk

833
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,069
about that in my talk but that's the

834
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:57,619
hard part so it's the tube for qubit

835
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:01,249
error so where we are here right now is

836
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:04,729
where we show data nine qubits error is

837
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,739
about a little bit under 10 to - ooh

838
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:09,680
it's below the threshold okay and what

839
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,390
we want to do is get to ten to minus

840
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,989
three or lower and then we want to scale

841
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:19,069
up okay so that's what we want to do and

842
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,050
that's what we're working

843
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,290
right now so here's a like a competitor

844
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,260
of ours they have 15 cubits but it's

845
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,390
three to eight percent error it's way up

846
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,390
here here's another competitor it's two

847
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,700
cubits to 10 to minus three but it's not

848
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,860
done in a full system way so it's

849
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,680
interesting but whatever so you know

850
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,990
we're still working on it but we have to

851
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,250
go down this way

852
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,070
and then learn how to scale it up and

853
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,050
it's these two things that you have to

854
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,240
talk about doing and and and we're

855
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,220
moving we're really working hard to move

856
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,170
in this direction other people are it's

857
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,120
clear you have to do that but you have

858
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,620
to you have to understand those two

859
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,420
things so where are we right now I think

860
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,480
we're closer to Kitty Hawk than on the

861
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,150
moon okay we're trying to develop the

862
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,390
technology going from there to there but

863
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:18,250
okay okay now for your your audience

864
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,520
okay here's mine this is a it's I

865
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,100
personal message I don't there is okay

866
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,050
your is the Internet can it get broken

867
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,780
as far as say gonna get broken okay

868
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,030
there do exist and you know this more

869
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,750
than I do there it does exist classical

870
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,580
cryptography methods that are known to

871
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,590
be quantum resist or at least thought to

872
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,190
be known

873
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,070
okay so RSA is used because it's known

874
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,250
and reliable everyone can trust it okay

875
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,100
but there's quantum resistance code and

876
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,260
not thought to be broken by quantum

877
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,070
that's great

878
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,400
okay people are working on this and in

879
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,100
fact NIST has some testing and standards

880
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,740
program that's about ten years that's

881
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,050
gonna take about ten years where people

882
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,510
can get together and test it and and and

883
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,000
do it and that's really great okay and

884
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,160
we need more research and we need to do

885
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,890
that and you know let's let's make sure

886
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,070
that if RSA happens to be broken in some

887
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,940
future we'll have something to stand now

888
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,760
what's interesting is I hear comments

889
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,120
that days is a nice program but this

890
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,840
kind of ten year time frame is too slow

891
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,339
okay which I understand you want

892
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,489
make sure that you have a replacement

893
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:38,049
you know as soon as possible

894
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:41,710
now let me sorry if this is gonna sound

895
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,960
a little bit like giving you a hard time

896
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,920
but I kind of am building a quantum

897
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,839
computers really hard I hope you see

898
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,390
that okay and we have to build all this

899
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,019
technology to do that and people are

900
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:01,029
worried that it's gonna be faster to

901
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:03,910
build a quantum computer then it is to

902
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,279
be write some software code you know

903
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,769
thousands align the software code okay

904
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,989
is that it's not really is that what

905
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:13,359
people are worried about I understand

906
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,599
writing the code and doing it right is

907
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,999
really tough because you have to make

908
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,099
something work and not break something

909
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,489
that's always harder but I I really make

910
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,769
maybe a challenge to the community that

911
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,900
you know come on you guys have time to

912
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,269
do this your gun should focus on it

913
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:33,190
let's not you know let's save the

914
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,289
Internet that's you know save the world

915
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,989
okay from there with their data let's

916
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:41,710
get this to work and you know really try

917
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,319
to work on this and and solve this as

918
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,900
fast as we can I don't know if the

919
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,630
quantum computer will be built in ten

920
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,349
years but you concert' I think you can

921
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:56,349
certainly you know make sure that there

922
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:57,910
are alternatives are really good you

923
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,660
have the time to do that okay so that's

924
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,880
kind of the conclusion of this I now

925
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,369
just cut just a couple minutes talk

926
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,670
about why I and working on quantum

927
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,369
computing I mean given the fact that you

928
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,809
know factoring can be circumvented

929
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,789
problem the quantum factoring can be

930
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:21,009
certain David by classical computing I

931
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:22,630
said why do I want to spend my whole

932
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,729
career on doing something that you guys

933
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:28,029
can fix for me and what we want to do is

934
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:29,650
work on quantum computing to do

935
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,799
something that will benefit science and

936
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,660
humanity and I think there's something

937
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,700
there so it's not your field but let me

938
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,079
talk about what's going on

939
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,269
and a natural application is using a

940
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,700
quantum computer to solve what the

941
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,150
chemistry and physics

942
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,160
of other quantum systems in fact this

943
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,400
was the original idea Fineman way back

944
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,380
in the 80s of why you would want to

945
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,360
build a quantum computer so a lot of

946
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,130
people have been thinking about it but I

947
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,020
want to show either something really new

948
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,810
and exciting going on here so the idea

949
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,260
is a bunch of the do-e computers are

950
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,260
meta used for quantum simulation ok

951
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,170
things like the Habra process which

952
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,060
consists creates ammonia fertilizer

953
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,340
consume something like 2% of the world's

954
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,950
energy and yet there's bacteria that's

955
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,440
known to be much better than that lots

956
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,960
of other problems that one can solve if

957
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,360
one could do a simulation of course

958
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,060
what's hard about quantum simulations

959
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,540
for molecules is this exponential

960
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,030
blow-up of the state space you need ok

961
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,670
so i'm quantum computer you know how's

962
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,150
that resource so let me tell you why I'm

963
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,280
excited about this and this is a little

964
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,860
bit technical but you guys know all

965
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,520
about this there's been huge progress in

966
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,010
algorithms for this quantum chemistry

967
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,680
out thing and I want to just briefly

968
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,770
talk about that in the 80s Fineman came

969
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,390
up with the proposal why don't we do it

970
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:06,440
this way about 2015 people said look

971
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,690
it's not exponentially growing it's a

972
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,870
polynomial problem we didn't know what

973
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,000
the polynomial was but we knew it was an

974
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,730
exponential growing and then various

975
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,800
improvements over the years and finally

976
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,890
in 2013 they came up with a specific

977
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,460
enough algorithm that it grew as size

978
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,610
order and to the 11 ok so you're a

979
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,130
computer savvy audience when you hear

980
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,070
something's end the 11 you naturally say

981
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,980
well that's not gonna work ok which is

982
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,200
true and for example if you have the

983
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,450
norm number of orbital basis functions

984
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,130
which will be let's say 50 to a hundred

985
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,460
or more and the circuit depth which

986
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,770
scores the scales is and to the 11 and

987
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,590
you put on some scale rough scales here

988
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,340
and to the Leben is 10 2 to 21

989
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,420
operations it's the lifetime of the

990
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,340
universe not going to work we know that

991
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,620
we knew that but

992
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,570
what's great about being specific is

993
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,970
that people work on it and I'm gonna say

994
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,070
a lot of the work was done by the

995
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,000
Microsoft group and other people too and

996
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,370
bringing this number down and then

997
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,260
what's nice is there has been some nice

998
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,640
results down here recently coming down

999
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,130
to something that was published on the

1000
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,850
archive about two months ago where now

1001
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,600
we have an end to the 2.74 an exact

1002
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,290
solution or order and for an approximate

1003
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,050
solution so that's down here and now you

1004
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,870
see you know maybe solve the problems in

1005
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,140
less than a second way more efficient

1006
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:46,040
okay and for this particular case it's

1007
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,260
hundred logical qubits you need air

1008
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,390
Corrections so maybe a million cubits

1009
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,880
physical qubits this can be hard but

1010
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,010
this you know it's kind of in range a

1011
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,590
little bit this is approximate it might

1012
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,440
work with a hundred even 100 physical

1013
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,370
qubits this there's some insensitivity

1014
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,930
to errors here so we have to try this

1015
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,880
and that's something we're gonna build

1016
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,420
pretty soon so this is very exciting I

1017
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,800
want to note that there's this guy this

1018
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,320
babish guy who's been doing a bunch of

1019
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,470
stuff here Google hired him last year so

1020
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:23,900
we saw what was going on okay so that's

1021
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,640
the end of my talk here's our quantum

1022
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,010
hardware team and they've been working

1023
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,960
very hard to get this all put together

1024
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,930
and we've been Google at about three

1025
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,210
years now and there were kind of just

1026
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,980
been kind of working on our

1027
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,620
infrastructure and starting this year

1028
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,060
we're starting to get things put

1029
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,670
together 50 cubed machines

1030
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,980
scaling up from that and we hope to show

1031
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,770
some more results in the next year and

1032
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,810
see what we can do in terms of error

1033
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:55,210
correction also okay thank you very much

1034
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,049
you
