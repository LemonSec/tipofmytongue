1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,290
so I'm going to talk about seeker

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,920
computation pressure high resonance

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,350
setting Cydia is all work with a

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,809
listener Brock and boy sir hey Matt

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,880
amazi so let me start with the notion of

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,470
correlated by Vietnamese you start

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,160
correlations Lama speaking correlations

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,099
a fundamental cryptographic resource

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,890
ahead but this to compare securely over

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,239
a bit later in a people setting phase I

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,960
just would Neela sample IRB from anxiety

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,380
tribution

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,480
and then provide it to Alice Abby to Bob

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,770
and even online face Alice and Bob gives

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,079
a sequence s in an interactive protocol

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,940
to secure a camp use the intended

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,230
personality so note that the people

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,450
passing by independent observe

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,119
continuity also inputs fair to the

20
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,750
functionality mathematics and the secret

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,720
says i am ii am vulnerable to nuclear

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,670
attacks for example a malicious pop can

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,760
grab some additional information about a

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:29,700
mystic assess and by versus a malicious

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,650
alice can obtain some additional

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,040
information about more secure says a b

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,820
and in the case of liquid happen the

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,190
correlations are be is called Nikki

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,710
correlations so I am well study

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,380
correlations is a random a previous

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,210
shelter but before us

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,810
let me quickly well was a notion of one

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,740
out to pop reverse transfer so I know T

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,350
Padukone input 20 protocol between Alice

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,299
and Bob lytic as input to base X 0 X 1

36
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,389
from Alice and I single bit me from Bob

37
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,310
and CN look at the end of the butakov

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,900
Mullins XP but nothing about the azimuth

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,060
and

40
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,930
I don't know the child with me so I'm a

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,540
random a blueish alpha Y randomized

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,130
version cup of tea

43
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,900
these symbols TB x0 like one be

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,040
independently and uniformly at random it

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,840
provides seeker says x0 x1 to Alice and

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,209
me it's me to Bob and I mentioned

47
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,700
earlier the secret says happy are

48
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
vulnerable to liquid attacks so to

49
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,070
address this problem decide to syllabus

50
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,709
virtuosity and Sahai introduced the

51
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,810
notion of correlation next chapter

52
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,810
introduced in 2009 so Ram is speaking

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,730
Korean listened to checked us

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,040
technically coronations input and it

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,180
produce CQ independent copies of LT more

56
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,410
formally I an empty epsilon correlation

57
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,130
detector so a correlations are be here

58
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,610
to bethey interactive protocol it takes

59
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,720
mbcp says area B which I draw from the

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,370
correlation and it produces M

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,390
independent securities it allows T bit

62
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,640
of leakage part of success hiya B and

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,670
finally it is secure than semi honest

64
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,620
adversary with the simulation error

65
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,299
epsilon so with that in mind let me

66
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,390
summarize my work and our contributions

67
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,220
and in this table and is a stable secure

68
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,989
cell and M is a pork swept t is a liquid

69
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,590
resilience and epsilon is a simulation

70
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,799
arrow as the last the last column is a

71
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,630
number of browse for the color

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,200
combination Greg Schechter protocol so

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
the first result about this from across

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,710
on I say used n by two independent copy

75
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,700
of arrow T and they I would to get

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,740
linear impulse engraved

77
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,490
linear illiquid residence exponent so

78
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,000
high is security and the porticoes head

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,360
for house and no trap the constant alpha

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,890
beta and gamma are very small and the

81
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,410
subsequent work by Gupta is I'm as the

82
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,470
ELSA high in 2015 is the same

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,950
correlations they improve the liquid

84
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,160
Brazilian to end by four but shed off

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,030
the security so consequently the

86
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,510
security eligible and the portico had to

87
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,510
rouse they also consider a new

88
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,360
correlations namely the inner product

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,300
combinations in general the inner

90
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,610
product correlations over a vectors Phi

91
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,630
F 2 C by n yet curious correlation in

92
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,500
which a party gaps my vector in FN sub

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,790
web the alcohol so using the inner

94
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,000
correlations the I will do get n by 2 in

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,130
liquid resilience exponents of high

96
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,440
security to wrap protocols but one

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,890
octave so the question is as can we

98
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,950
encrypt the best in all four columns in

99
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,530
other words can we get linear in person

100
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,520
web linear in Makeba resilience equaling

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,590
so high security and tourist protocol so

102
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,380
our work so we're using the inner

103
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,600
product combinations of a suitable

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,990
left-field he admits a correlation

105
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,950
detector that has high person read aunt

106
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,580
Isabel

107
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,200
one minus small one president's to end

108
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,160
by to be doubly kids has a poor in so

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,220
high security and finally to raise

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,440
protocol agreed always the contraction

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,840
of our colonization ejector the next few

112
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,770
slides next let me state our pleases

113
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,259
more formally

114
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,539
so the first main is as we sell that for

115
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,139
Emmys constant data is the range 0 and

116
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,120
1/2 they exist like correlations and

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,900
sexy to Rao combination detector for

118
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,409
that correlation set that if the number

119
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,620
of liquid meet T equal to 1/2 minus C

120
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,939
times n then the simulation error the

121
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,680
equalizer is small and in fact we choose

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,039
the correlations to be the inner product

123
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,599
correlations over a suitable lag field F

124
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,629
where the size F equal to 2d bath at the

125
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:36,120
end so our charisma check the investor

126
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,389
Union to amateur based public age the

127
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,939
question is that doesn't exist like

128
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,909
correlation each actor for some inner

129
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,249
product correlations that achieves over

130
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:53,389
n by 2 bit of leakage Molinari can be

131
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,370
meaningful about the maximum liquid

132
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,169
resilience of any correlation and our

133
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,500
second business associate questions we

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,439
saw that the exists a universal constant

135
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,050
epsilon star greater than 0 such that

136
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,189
for any arbitrary field F any M 1 n by 2

137
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:19,080
epsilon correlation ejector for the

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,029
inner product correlations has a

139
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,240
simulation error epsilon endless epsilon

140
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,159
star weather secrets a size n equal to K

141
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,419
8 hemlocks I of F so basically this

142
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,729
theorem say that for the inner product

143
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,208
correlations which sequences of size m

144
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,669
evilly n pi choose based from the

145
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,300
success it is impossible to twill

146
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,640
checked even one LP so note that cities

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,339
as proof so ultimately observe liquid

148
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,310
resilience a chip by our ejector and

149
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,109
thus the ims 15 ejector

150
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,690
so next memory involve as a high-level

151
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,250
contraction of a few about our

152
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,280
correlation detector but before that let

153
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,860
me introduce an important concept some

154
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,490
needed for the contractor name is a a

155
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,000
previous linear function evaluations

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
instead of Bora Singh LT our Co

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,180
relations produces ugly Mimmie of

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,140
function evaluations so another a

159
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,330
previous linear function operations over

160
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,190
a few f represented as only f it takes

161
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,150
to few elements IEP from alice and a

162
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,440
single filament a sambar and it provides

163
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,340
Z equal to ax ax plus B 2 bar okay so

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,750
knows that some privacy requirements was

165
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,970
further away slept Alice against no

166
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,810
additional advantage impacting ax and

167
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,400
Bob gates no additional event it in

168
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,540
pre-tape I and also not apt the LT

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,360
functionally equivalent to a layover see

170
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,250
up to so with that in mind let me

171
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,900
actually go over the contractions of our

172
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,110
Korean attractor Sony remembers our

173
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,640
algún adapt given leaky correlations

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,030
Alice and Bob went to securely compute

175
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,290
MLS overseer - so our contractions

176
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,600
basically is a composition of two steps

177
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,700
so we take the inner product

178
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,510
correlations of a black field with

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,310
Timmy's

180
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,400
leakage from the success and you get one

181
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,040
la of us a few F M from one early over

182
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,850
the field F we get M copies up early

183
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,230
over Z up to so know that the first step

184
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,320
here in metro generalizations of the zi

185
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,010
ms 15 for the co over IP over Z up to to

186
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,470
IB overlap fields

187
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,820
I went over the detail of support OCO if

188
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,920
anyone interested in the protocol please

189
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,230
see our paper and it's a second step the

190
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,800
main idea is that we are back em copies

191
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,340
Haleh oversee up to into one outlet over

192
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,440
POF wherever you left field of

193
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,670
characteristic - okay

194
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,440
MZ see one of our main technical

195
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,160
contributors and I want to emphasize

196
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,200
that before this we knew how to get

197
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,250
multiple copies

198
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,460
Noblet overseer - from multiple copies

199
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,580
about lay over a big field but we don't

200
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,000
know how to do that from one over a big

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,050
fear and the efficiencies of the

202
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,500
embedding depends on the value of M and

203
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,060
the relaxer value of M so better

204
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,080
processing rate and also this embedding

205
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,870
relies on finding solutions to the

206
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,460
secular some recessed problem and the

207
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,400
title of some presets problem also have

208
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,830
applications in magic multiplication and

209
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,350
now next let me step the checklist and

210
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,220
fix a problem we went to fight two other

211
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,450
sets s and T each had M non negative

212
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,210
elements sub-tab the only solutions to

213
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,820
the equation si plus VI equal to si plus

214
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,720
DK is achieve also Rousseff's in other

215
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,830
what I gotta say

216
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,970
good okay and we want to maximize the

217
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,030
style as an T so this problem is

218
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,000
generalizations of the well-known TV set

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,110
problem and and also consumed si equal T

220
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,640
equal to TI this problem e identical to

221
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,750
the TV set problem

222
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,209
and using existing equal assist

223
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,139
construction of the TV set we achieve m

224
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,480
equal to n TC bar one - small one and in

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,149
an ongoing work we saw that m equal to

226
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,930
theta M impossible and I want to

227
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,240
emphasize less using the solutions to

228
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,529
this problem we can get an MIP but I

229
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,459
couldn't know as a detail of embedding

230
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,439
you give anyone interested in you can

231
00:13:54,439 --> 00:14:00,110
find in how paper and for the rest of

232
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,180
the top like we talked about the other

233
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,850
size above having maximum liquid

234
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,269
resilience so the question is that which

235
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,639
techniques can be used to have about the

236
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,769
maximum liquid resilience of any

237
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,600
correlation an existing approach is a

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,589
partition argument but the approach have

239
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,850
a bottleneck it applies only to multiple

240
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,559
independent samples of small

241
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,339
correlations for instance we can use a

242
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,009
petition argument to say that the

243
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,050
correlation LT to develop and virtual

244
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,740
each resilient to at most n by for mr.

245
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,269
bleakie however this technique vanished

246
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,000
m2 secret says Rick assemble from

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Volpone correlated correlations for

248
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,410
example the inner product correlations

249
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,259
so to overcome the bottleneck we

250
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,230
introduced a new measure name is the

251
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,250
symbol partition number but for let me

252
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,899
introduce the notion of civil valid I

253
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,120
symbol gap yep babbitt i graph struggle

254
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,759
apt of it chromatic component yeah

255
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,850
Michael E and I clicked here I can

256
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,110
delete my math i graph and the symbol

257
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,990
partition number of a parrot i graph is

258
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,170
a minimal number of simple graphs submit

259
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,480
that to petition it exits for example

260
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,540
this graph here in not a simple graph

261
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,340
but it can become

262
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,900
into two simple gap like this the symbol

263
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,510
and the same color act means the same

264
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:53,270
connected component so why do we care

265
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,950
about zero correlations can be

266
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,630
attractively represented as wraps and

267
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,810
accommodations

268
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,540
you waited by but the Class G where's

269
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,300
the lab mat I said L is a setup over

270
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,980
Sibyl Piper says I am if Alice and some

271
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,440
rabbit I said ah you just had a book

272
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,220
over Sibyl Webber say happy football and

273
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,560
the great abstract I am II is a

274
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,830
probability of getting area B from the

275
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,250
correlations and in a in our paper and

276
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,060
in this top

277
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,520
whizzers considers the correlations in

278
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,020
which the wept are the same okay so for

279
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,980
example this graph represents the inner

280
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,950
product correlations about the up to

281
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,980
three motto we can see that 0 0 it

282
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,780
connected to every knot on the right

283
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,900
because 0 0 you also cannot to every

284
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,589
vector on the right and zero one equated

285
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:07,520
to 0 0 1 0 but not 0 1 and 1 1 now let

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,170
me show the connection between maximum

287
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,150
liquid resilience and simple petition

288
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,849
number so suppose I grab G like here

289
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,550
correlations and suppose the exist

290
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,310
lambda symbol grabs the petition that

291
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,109
partition so axis at the graph G then C

292
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,650
not resilience to lock member miss

293
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,480
leakage so intuitively this dilemma say

294
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,490
that and never bow on the symbol

295
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,540
partition number implies a never bow or

296
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,860
the maximum liquid resilience

297
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,220
and finally let me let's keep the pet

298
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,170
emission of symbol petition number for

299
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,390
the two correlations we have seen

300
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,730
earlier for the color correlations LT

301
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,720
with success of size and the symbol

302
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,500
partisan number is to debug and by far

303
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,250
it means as the maximum freshener liquid

304
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,340
resilience even thought and note that

305
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,860
our technique subsumes the petition

306
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,710
everyone and for the inner product

307
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,550
correlations with success of site as the

308
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,760
symbol petition numbers is say up f2z

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,230
bad end by two so it means the maximum

310
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,320
frictional liquid resilience he and most

311
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,320
have so in summary we measure two

312
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,260
contributions the first contribution is

313
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,500
as the exist like correlations that

314
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,190
generates amid success it produce entity

315
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,309
bar one - model one secure independent

316
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,820
of this and it is resilient to amateur

317
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,790
bit of leakage and the second

318
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,640
contribution is that we introduce a web

319
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,160
heretic measure the symbol partition

320
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,100
number and it can be used to about a

321
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,030
wicked resilience of correlations and

322
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,390
thank you for listening

323
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,200
[Applause]

324
