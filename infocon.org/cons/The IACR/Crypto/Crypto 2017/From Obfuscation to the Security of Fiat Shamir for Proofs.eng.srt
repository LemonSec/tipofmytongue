1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,160
okay so yeah so this talk is and

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,450
security of the future mere paradigm

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,820
when apply to statistically sound proof

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,640
this is joint work with Ron Roth gloom

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,600
in guy rathalu so Ron was supposed to

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,700
give this talk he's an amazing speaker

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,400
but unfortunately for you guys and for

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,310
me he couldn't make it so I'm gonna be

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,390
his proxy so okay so let's start so the

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,489
future may be errific is a really really

11
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,670
beautiful and elegant way to convert any

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,069
three-round ID scheme into a signature

13
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:42,079
scheme so what is the difference between

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,780
an ID scheme and a signature scheme the

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,909
main difference is that an ID scheme is

16
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,800
interactive it contains three rounds

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,359
wherein signature scheme is a

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,120
non-interactive you just sign a message

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,280
so what is the idea how do you kind of

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,499
reduce this interaction so there is

21
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,069
extremely simple and beautiful so there

22
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:01,969
is the following

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,949
you know what the signer is gonna

24
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,960
produce the entire three messages

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,670
denoted twelve the stock by alpha beta

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,920
and gamma he will produce this on his

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,180
own subject to beta will need to be a

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,350
hash of the first message alpha and the

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,810
message to be signed em okay so when you

30
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,399
want to sign the message and you

31
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,340
generate alpha like the prover beta will

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,979
simply be a hash of alpha in the message

33
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,259
one sign and then you sign you generate

34
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,840
Ghana so alpha beta gamma is a proof and

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,850
it's accepted if it's an accepted

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,189
transcript by the verifier of the ID

37
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,679
scheme and if beta is indeed the hash of

38
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,469
alpha and the message when this hash is

39
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,990
going to be part of the public key so

40
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,299
that's the transformation it's extremely

41
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,810
simple its elegant it's nice and it's

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,759
the great power of it is that typically

43
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,189
signature schemes were extremely complex

44
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,219
and to construct and identification

45
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,869
scheme are extremely simple to construct

46
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,030
so kind of shows you've kind of a very

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,189
way very easy way to go from one to the

48
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,289
other and indeed he was extremely

49
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,990
popular both by Tara tissues and more

50
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,690
applied people I'm sure most of you by

51
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,740
the way show of hands who's heard of

52
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,690
this paradigm the future in paradigm

53
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,510
okay so yeah so as you see

54
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,190
and meanwhile heard about it and it's

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,110
it's really beautiful and the main

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,750
question is is it secure so if you start

57
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,970
with his secure ID scheme do you get a

58
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,030
secure signature scheme and let me give

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,879
you the intuition why did secure ok so

60
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,799
what can an impersonator who tries to

61
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,930
photo choose a signature what can he do

62
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,390
he gets the sash now suppose the flash

63
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,260
is really great it's like a

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,970
pseudo-random function so it's like

65
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,360
random and moreover suppose that all the

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,519
impersonator can do it kind of use this

67
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,159
hashes a black box ok it's an active kid

68
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,390
or something all he can do is kind of

69
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,849
use it as a black box in this case into

70
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,099
generating generating this transcript by

71
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,709
alpha beta gamma by interacting with a

72
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,079
box with random or with this box is

73
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,660
really the same as been trapped in with

74
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,090
a verifier in the ID scheme so they this

75
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,500
can be secure the signature scheme

76
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,140
should also be secure ok so that's the

77
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,700
reason why security should hold and

78
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,760
indeed this was formalized in the random

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,379
Oracle model so it was proved that this

80
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,889
asked paradigm is secure in the random

81
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:24,530
Oracle model if the hash is modeled as a

82
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,540
random Oracle by a series of beautiful

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,130
work starting with the work of Pancho

84
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,690
Valens turtle gave a really really

85
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,060
beautiful idea with the lemma of

86
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,389
showing this this security ok so the

87
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,099
main question though the remains is it

88
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,410
secure in the plain model so can we come

89
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,510
up with an actual hash function at

90
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,160
random or cover an actual description of

91
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,139
a hash function for which this paradigm

92
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,090
is secure so in 2003 together with Shafi

93
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,489
we gave a negative result we showed that

94
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,160
no and let me explain to you what what

95
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,590
exactly we showed what we actually did

96
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,769
is we gave a contrived example of an ID

97
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,680
scheme of a secure ID scheme for which

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,780
the corresponding signature scheme will

99
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,849
be insecure no matter which hash

100
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,480
functions you use ok so let's say this

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,699
game is contrived so definitely say you

102
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,440
know oh don't use the hash onto this

103
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,959
insecure the take home message was from

104
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,149
this work is that

105
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,430
don't try to kind of prove a general

106
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,380
possibility result for the fear to mere

107
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,940
paradigm because we do have counter

108
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,430
examples ok so in general it's not

109
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,330
always secure Oh

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,470
actually this fil jamia paradigm

111
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,240
paradigm even though it was originally

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,340
defined to convert ID schemes into

113
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,919
signature schemes it's much more general

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,410
than that and has a lot of applications

115
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,320
beyond ID to signatures and in

116
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,720
particular it's been used it can be used

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,440
to kind of convert to reduce interaction

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,810
in any interactive protocol so you can

119
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,699
start with any console on public point

120
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,400
interactive protocol and convert it to

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,190
just two rounds using the future mere

122
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,340
paradigm okay how in the first round the

123
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,160
verifier will just send a hash as before

124
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,620
and the second round the prover will

125
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,530
generate the entire transcript on his

126
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,830
own where the random messages of the

127
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,830
verifier he will compute by hashing the

128
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,680
transcript so far okay using the hash

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,380
that he got from the verifier so you can

130
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,340
think of it in this extended setting and

131
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,650
again oh and this this is very useful

132
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,479
it's been used a lot one of the staples

133
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,909
examples is McCauley it's very

134
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,210
influential work on CS proofs uses this

135
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,159
paradigm there's been many many works in

136
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,580
the literature that use this paradigm in

137
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,860
the main question as before is it secure

138
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,270
when we look at it in this extended

139
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,710
setting do we get security so one can

140
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,159
very easily one can show that the same

141
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,530
kind of idea to achieve Allen's turn can

142
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,139
be used to argue that this paradigm this

143
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,900
extended paradigm is secure in the

144
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,270
random Oracle model ok so again if we

145
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,650
model H as a random Oracle it is secure

146
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,870
but then to ask is it secure in the

147
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,150
plain model and in 2001 in his seminal

148
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,250
work Baraka gave a negative result

149
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,860
he showed that it's insecure and again

150
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,810
let me explain what a what we mean by

151
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,479
insecure what he actually showed he gave

152
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,960
an example of he showed the existence of

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,430
a concerned public coin zero-knowledge

154
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,699
protocol okay this seems very completely

155
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,469
in relay unrelated to the future mere

156
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,569
paradigm

157
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,629
however it was known that the existence

158
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:45,479
of such a zero knowledge protocol

159
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,099
immediately it immediately implies the

160
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,770
insecurity of this extended Faramir

161
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,849
paradigm why so here is the intuition

162
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,679
the intuition is the following what does

163
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,509
it mean so let's say this protocol here

164
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,459
the interactive proof is zero knowledge

165
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,679
what does it mean by definition of zero

166
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,139
knowledge it means for any cheating

167
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,719
v-fib star there exists an efficient

168
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,610
simulator who can simulate the

169
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,569
interaction right so this simulator

170
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,050
actually can be a cheating prover in the

171
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,279
two-round protocol why think of the V

172
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,499
star the cheating verifier and instead

173
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,209
of doing what he's supposed to he uses a

174
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,969
hash okay so he actually generates the

175
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,860
messages in this interactive protocol

176
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,449
using hash that's a type of a cheating

177
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,789
verifier for this cheating bear fighter

178
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,769
this is simulator by the zero knowledge

179
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,169
property and this simulator given the

180
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,589
hash just generates an a transcript that

181
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,699
is indistinguishable so this was noticed

182
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,009
by work of had a tinactin by docket al

183
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,889
that if we did have a zero knowledge of

184
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,499
protocol that would have made a public

185
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,879
point can surround zero knowledge

186
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
protocol it would immediately imply the

187
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,129
insecurities of the future mere paradigm

188
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,829
and since Baraka gave constructed such

189
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,959
as your knowledge protocol we got the

190
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,269
insecurities okay so so far I just gave

191
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,219
you examples why the fear tomatoes

192
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,050
insecure it's in the extended future

193
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,959
meals insecure as was shown by back the

194
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,899
original Fiat Ramirez insecure as later

195
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,449
showed by Shafi and myself as a

196
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,069
follow-up work to Barak and we actually

197
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,419
used many of his ideas but still I

198
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,669
promised you that I'm gonna have a

199
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,919
positive result so where's that positive

200
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,969
result hiding so let's take a closer

201
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,099
look at the negative results if we take

202
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,860
a closer look at these examples of where

203
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,990
the negative result comes we can see

204
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,269
that the initial protocol both our ID

205
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,120
scheme and zero-knowledge protocol have

206
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,450
only half computed

207
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh soundless okay there are not

208
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,530
statistically sound okay so the

209
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,420
interactive protocol if you're

210
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,310
all-powerful you can cheat you can break

211
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,400
the protocol so one can ask well what if

212
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,900
we start with an interpretive protocol

213
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,750
that has statistical soundless can you

214
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,610
is the future meal secure in that case

215
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,070
so if you start with an interactive

216
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,560
proof that statistically sound and

217
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,700
convert it to an two round argument

218
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,170
using the Faramir paradigm is their own

219
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,790
any hope is can we prove that it that

220
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,350
it's sound and in a nutshell our result

221
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,050
is yes under strong assumptions so what

222
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,360
do we show we show that the fear to me

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,460
or the extended fear to me the focus to

224
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,170
think it'd be easier to think of the

225
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,790
extended future meal throughout the

226
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,420
stock is secure when applied to

227
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,090
statistically sound proofs as a post

228
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,640
argument under strong assumptions such

229
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,190
as IO obfuscation I'll get back to the

230
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,250
assumptions in a minute but before I

231
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,150
explain the assumptions in more detail

232
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,700
let me first talk about prior work and

233
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,150
the security hmm for proofs so we

234
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,590
noticed a long time ago that our

235
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,030
negative results were only for

236
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,230
computationally a sound proof and

237
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,510
there's a lot of work trying to prove or

238
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,270
disprove the future mere paradigm when

239
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,940
applied to statistically sound proof and

240
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,970
let me kind of give you the main results

241
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,500
in the literature that I'm aware of

242
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,480
so on the positive result Barak Lyndon

243
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,390
in vidonne showed that there exists some

244
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,820
property of hash function some kind of

245
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,650
entropy preserving property that I don't

246
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,600
want to define that if your hash

247
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,610
function has this property that when you

248
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,050
apply the fair treatment with this kind

249
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,750
of hash function you will get security

250
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,010
but whether there exists a charge

251
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,530
functions we don't know okay there's no

252
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,480
construction or instantiations a later

253
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,700
Dody set I'll show that there actually

254
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,950
does exist such a hash function that has

255
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,440
this special property but under some

256
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,010
assumption

257
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,190
assuming there's some robust randomness

258
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,840
condensers with the certain properties

259
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,490
and where there are such things with

260
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,030
live we don't know so you know we kind

261
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,280
of know what we're looking for but we

262
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,720
didn't find it yet and there recently

263
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,940
there's a result by middle back and

264
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,580
venturi who actually show gave a

265
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,930
positive result for a special class of

266
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,880
protocols special classify D scheme so

267
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,260
that when you convert them into

268
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,310
signature schemes

269
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,950
you'll get solace but this special class

270
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,830
doesn't contain I don't know really

271
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,110
what's in there but nothing that one of

272
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,710
the ID schemes that were around though

273
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,000
you know we're suggesting the literature

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,960
are contained in in this class they also

275
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,420
showed how to kind of convert some ID

276
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,930
schemes with some properties under IO to

277
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,790
kind of fall into this special class in

278
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,190
the crs model so they do have some kind

279
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,390
of a general result as well okay and the

280
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,020
negative result we also know this joint

281
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,930
work with beacons guitar that you cannot

282
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,350
prove soundness of the Faramir paradigm

283
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,810
even for proofs just focusing on proofs

284
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,420
you cannot prove soundness using what's

285
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,850
called kind of a black box reduction to

286
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,680
a falsifiable assumption giving

287
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,960
indicating that using the techniques

288
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,850
that we have we won't be able to prove

289
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,980
soundness based on standard assumption

290
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,290
so falsifiable assumption is a notion I

291
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,330
introduced by now all for those who are

292
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,830
not familiar with this notion just think

293
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,260
of it as standard assumptions okay it's

294
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,730
a notion that should can supposed to

295
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,570
capture all standard assumptions okay so

296
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,510
this is where where we stand and now let

297
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,530
me explain our results in more detail so

298
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,660
what we show in this work we actually

299
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,260
show an explicit hash function right

300
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,190
there - isle of a PRF family such that

301
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,160
if you start with any interactive proof

302
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,340
that statistically sound then your

303
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
two-hour round argument will be sound

304
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,140
under some assumptions so let me tell

305
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,750
you our assumptions first assumption

306
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,579
we need to assume that this IO over

307
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,370
there that we use is really secure it

308
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,470
has to be actually subjects financially

309
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,410
secure or in other words its need to be

310
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,689
to to then secure where n is the input

311
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,879
links but just think of it as subjects

312
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,620
financial IO this is kind of an

313
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,240
assumption that often we need to rely on

314
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,709
when we use IO and applications ok

315
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,410
another assumption is that the function

316
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,379
f sub s that will be IO is what's called

317
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,560
a puncture Bo PRF again with Starbucks

318
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,439
financial security and this is known how

319
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,269
to construct based on sub-exponential

320
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,300
one-way function and the third

321
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
assumption and this is kind of weird the

322
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,709
third assumption actually has nothing to

323
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,629
do with the construction ok so the age

324
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,649
the hats that I'm using is just IO of a

325
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,990
PRF of a punctual PRF family so a very

326
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,600
secure IO and a very secure puncture

327
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,540
bowl a pseudo-random function but I have

328
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,339
another assumption and the other

329
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,310
assumption is I'm assuming exponential

330
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,689
security of multi bit point function

331
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,199
obfuscation I you know a weak definition

332
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,209
of facin we only need input hiding

333
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,759
obfuscation which is kind of weaker than

334
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,000
BBB but we need exponential security for

335
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,970
this multi bit point function

336
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,100
Association now when you look at this

337
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,600
it's really not clear where does point

338
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,069
function application come into play so

339
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,410
first let me say that this this notion

340
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,970
has been studied and produced what

341
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,009
before and it's been constructed under a

342
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,879
strong variant of the DDH assumption we

343
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,730
do not need auxilary input in this

344
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,680
assumption for those who because

345
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,790
exhuming put it there is a lot of

346
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,439
caveats we do not need observer inputs

347
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,110
for those who are familiar but the

348
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,430
interesting thing this assumption is

349
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,399
only used at keeneland analysis ok so we

350
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,350
were in the analysis if I have time to

351
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,389
show you you'll see we use this

352
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:13,250
assumption ok so this is a result now

353
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,559
let's pause a minute and try to

354
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,079
understand this result so what's the

355
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,899
take-home message the take-home message

356
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,550
here so maybe maybe some of you in the

357
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,329
audience will say oh is this efficient

358
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,389
so the take-home message is no it's not

359
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,910
efficient should you go and use the

360
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,529
fifth Jameel from now on with this kind

361
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,300
of hash function because you know we

362
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,329
prove soundness no so do not try this at

363
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:36,629
home

364
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,369
it'll be very inefficient it's not a

365
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,319
good idea so what is the take home

366
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,629
message so there's two ways to think of

367
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,410
this result one is to say look this was

368
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,529
a proof of concept that you can there is

369
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,029
with hash function for which you can

370
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,980
prove security and you can take this as

371
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,259
an invitation to try to you know prove

372
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,670
this for an efficient hash hash family

373
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,929
one can also think of it as you know I

374
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,490
don't know some of us have been trying

375
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,420
to prove negative result for this so it

376
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,429
kind of shows you well in order to prove

377
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,499
a negative result you'll meet disprove

378
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:12,540
these assumptions or you'll need to

379
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,999
overcome you know serious hurdles in

380
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:18,059
order to prove a negative result but in

381
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,600
addition I think this theorem has

382
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,819
actually really interesting applications

383
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:27,499
beyond the Faramir paradigm and let me

384
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:30,899
give you one corollary so one corner is

385
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,179
that we get out of this theorem is we

386
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,209
prove that there does not exist a glance

387
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,220
around public-owned zero knowledge proof

388
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,809
statistically sound proof so Barak

389
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,279
showed this for an argument for

390
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,199
computationally so Barak Shawn sorry

391
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,600
that there exists a cancer around public

392
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,420
coin argument computationally sound does

393
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,089
there exist a statistically sound zero

394
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,269
knowledge public coin we shall know okay

395
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,610
so this problem is kind of opened and

396
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,759
for the last few decades there was a

397
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,859
very famous work by gold right and

398
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,409
Kartik that shows that there does not

399
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,289
exist accounts around public coin black

400
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,439
box zero knowledge proof so if you

401
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,209
restrict the simulator to use the

402
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,369
cheating vampire the black box then

403
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,289
there does not exist but the question

404
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,089
whether there exists you know any zero

405
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,220
knowledge proof non black box the ultra

406
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,260
booth with Scouts around public Oien

407
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,130
was an open question and a can a

408
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,980
corollary of our main theorem is that

409
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,990
under our assumption there does not

410
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,530
exist and why why is that a corollary

411
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,110
so let's recall the transformation that

412
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,440
we saw earlier that if you had a console

413
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,830
run public point zero knowledge proof

414
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,520
this in itself is a counter example it

415
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,750
demonstrate the insecurity of the future

416
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:58,500
mere paradigm so okay sorry

417
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,340
so so if you had such a thing you'll get

418
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,870
that the future mere period I won't

419
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,210
apply the proof would be insecure but

420
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,500
what I showed you that under my

421
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,380
assumption this is secure and so this

422
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,720
acure it must imply that there does not

423
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,950
exist a car to run public coins your

424
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,750
knowledge proof and in particular what

425
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,140
this implies is that parallel petition

426
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,450
does not preserve zero knowledge so in

427
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,680
particularly take your favorite

428
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,050
three-round you know zero node Wisconsin

429
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,820
soundness Andrew Blum protocol or

430
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,860
3-coloring

431
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,680
zero knowledge zero for three coloring

432
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,960
all these protocols if any of this if

433
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,670
you want to try to do run them in

434
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,740
parallel zero knowledge will not be

435
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,070
preserved okay so that's a corollary of

436
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,910
our main result another way to view our

437
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,530
result in a different using different

438
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,930
terminology is we can cancel result in

439
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,850
the terminology of correlation

440
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,010
intractable hash functions so this

441
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,410
notion was it's a very beautiful notion

442
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,390
introduced by Kinetico that Hanna Levy

443
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,300
and this property should be thought of

444
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,610
as a proxy to random Oracle so we use

445
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,500
run to random Oracle model a lot and the

446
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,910
question is what property do we really

447
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,850
use from these you know what property of

448
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,580
Hashem does this random Oracle model use

449
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,090
and one the property that was put forth

450
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,090
is correlation and tractability so what

451
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,220
does correlation tractability means so a

452
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,800
hash function is set to be correlation

453
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,030
intractable it's given a hash in the

454
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,810
family it's hard to find X and H of X

455
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,870
that satisfy some rare relation okay

456
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,060
what does it mean so for any relation

457
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,920
that's rare or evasive so what is an

458
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,410
evasive relation a basic relation is one

459
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,920
that for any input X there only neglige

460
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,070
many wise men a fraction of wise

461
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,820
satisfied the relation and age has said

462
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,560
to be correlation tractable is it for

463
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,360
any such rare or evasive relation given

464
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,270
a random hash from the family it is hard

465
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,850
to find X such that X H of X is in the

466
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,750
relation and in the original work of

467
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,400
Canadia time they show that there does

468
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
not exist correlation tractable age with

469
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,930
where the description of the hash is

470
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,010
short shorter than the input size

471
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,570
recently there's a very nice work of

472
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,730
kinetic chain and raisin that showed

473
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,060
that there does exist correlation

474
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,870
tractable age but for some relation that

475
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,030
for all evasive relations but rather for

476
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,530
all of its relationships that are

477
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,010
computable in some a priori fixed

478
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,800
polynomial time assuming I own related

479
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
assumptions in essential our result what

480
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,080
we show is that this specific hash

481
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,690
function are you applied to this

482
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,480
punctual PRF its correlation intractable

483
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,850
under our assumptions okay so let's just

484
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,880
see kind of a quick summary that's what

485
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,770
we showed is under the assumptions

486
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,710
stated above that the Faramir paradigm

487
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,220
is secure wouldn't apply to proofs which

488
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,350
implies that there does not resolve the

489
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,690
open problem that there does not exist

490
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,300
can't surround public Oien as your

491
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,550
knowledge proof which in turn implies

492
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,360
that peril repetition does not preserve

493
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,790
zero knowledge and also more generally

494
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,740
cast in the language of correlation

495
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,570
tractability we show that there does

496
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,700
exist a correlation and tractable hash

497
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,220
function which kind of can be used maybe

498
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,190
in other settings to try to remove a

499
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,040
random Oracle so in the few minutes I

500
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,230
have left maybe I'll try to give a very

501
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,140
very one-minute brief overview of the

502
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,200
proof so let's just show the proof idea

503
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,930
for the future mere paradigm so why

504
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,060
would it be secure to go from ID

505
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,500
50-round ID to signature so intuitively

506
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,590
so what is our hash it's are you above

507
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,290
pseudo-random function if instead of IO

508
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,780
we used VBB security like virtual black

509
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,300
box we had Oracle and as we said it is

510
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,830
secure that kind of security in the

511
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,870
random Oracle model so that we do we do

512
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,120
know it's secure but we don't have vvb

513
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,050
security so kind of course so let's use

514
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,650
IO the question is I am strong enough is

515
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,390
that type of alpha schedule in which

516
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,150
only promises us in the finish ability

517
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,390
is it strong enough and what we show is

518
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,810
it is strong enough if we start with the

519
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,510
typically sound proof as opposed to

520
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,860
computational sound if we start with the

521
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,330
computation sound this is not strong

522
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,460
enough because we have examples but if

523
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,110
we start with a statistically sound it

524
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,890
is strong enough so why so what a

525
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,620
statistically sound proofs what

526
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,600
properties they have the property they

527
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,120
have is that for any first message for

528
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,360
an X not in the language for every first

529
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,630
message alpha there are very few betas

530
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,660
for which there exists a gamma that will

531
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,170
correspond to an accepting transcript

532
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,100
now if we use a PRF a really strong PRF

533
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,490
here then by the fact by the strength of

534
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,500
this PRF the fact that F of s this is

535
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,420
not had nothing to do with IO just the

536
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,970
fact that the parent is strong enough it

537
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,000
means let's look let's all alpha

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,860
baddam if beta which is H of alpha kind

539
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,990
of for that there exists a gamma okay so

540
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,670
you kind of can cheat with that alpha

541
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,510
okay so by the secure because it's a

542
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,430
look like a random function this

543
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,640
property that there exist few good betas

544
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,430
should remain so till one can easily

545
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,190
show that there exists a few bad alphas

546
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,040
so there is a few alphas for which H of

547
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,370
alpha there exists a gamma okay so there

548
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,910
exists a few bad alphas and now the main

549
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,360
part is to show to argue that IO implies

550
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,880
that it's hard to find these bad gammas

551
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,260
these bad alphas

552
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,920
so the ion

553
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,980
alpha okay to prove this is that where

554
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,780
we use the multi bit point functions so

555
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,250
I don't have time but I'll just say that

556
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,970
the main idea is to just plant like

557
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,850
alpha star and beta star that have an

558
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,700
accepting gamma star so we can plant

559
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,450
that in the PRF and we prove that its

560
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,110
heart of that the cheating prover will

561
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,550
find this planted alpha star thousand

562
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,650
from our assumptions and then we get a

563
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,320
contradiction by saying oh this alpha

564
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,270
star that we planted actually there's no

565
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,640
way to find it because we advocated

566
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,710
we're advocating this room using a

567
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,920
really really strong px okay so that's

568
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,870
kind of the high level idea but again

569
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,270
just to summarize fear jameelah secure

570
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,880
for proofs this is very great news for

571
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,900
me I've been working on this problem

572
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,910
since I was a grad student so I'm very

573
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,190
happy to see an a positive result I'll

574
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,050
bite under a very strong assumption and

575
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,660
inefficient would be great to reduce

576
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,210
assumption to gain efficiency and so on

577
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,150
and then we get really interesting

578
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,650
correlation that have nothing to do with

579
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,360
the Faramir paradigm and kind of resolve

580
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,240
just classical open problems relate to

581
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
your knowledge correlation trapped

582
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,030
ability and so on okay thank you

583
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,889
[Applause]
