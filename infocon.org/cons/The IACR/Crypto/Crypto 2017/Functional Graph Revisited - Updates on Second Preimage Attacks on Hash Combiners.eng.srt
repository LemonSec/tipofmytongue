00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,200
hello everyone the topic of this talk

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,930
yes our functional graph based generic

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,290
attack on Hodgkin banners first recall

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,130
the security requirements for hash hash

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,010
functions the collision resistance that

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,140
is it should be difficult to find two

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,390
distinct message have the same message

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,109
digest and free limit resistant for a

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,760
given hatchet value it should be

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,370
difficult to find it a message that have

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,650
the digest equals to this value and

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,829
second preimage resistance forgive a

13
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,440
message it should be difficult to find

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,300
another message after that just equals

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,160
to this that of them so for ideal hash

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
function we could take is X Factor's

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
security for collision resistant be two

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,050
to the N divided by two mean because of

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,570
the birthday attack and two to the N for

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,860
preimage and second preimage resistance

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,809
so we usually build the hash function

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,960
use iterative construction a classical

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,240
one used a more code Angad construction

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,450
for give a message it first append some

25
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,060
padding bits and the message lunch and

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,569
so that's the line is dividable by P and

27
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:23,800
it split the message into blocks of P

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,250
bit and use those message blocks to

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,160
update an internal state with an

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,009
identical compression function and note

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,209
that the last message block yes encoded

32
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,030
with the message lines and this is the

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,110
so-called the alliance's dressing

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,229
so among whereas approach to build a

35
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,989
secure hash function there is one in

36
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:53,259
your stay so called combiner and that

37
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,869
used to combine multiple and related

38
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,360
hash function in such a way that the

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,030
resulting function could provide the

40
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,569
security and leave vacation of security

41
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,090
robust and used that's yes the comm

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,250
banner is more secure than his

43
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,459
underlying hash function oh it is secure

44
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,920
as long as at least one of the

45
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,290
underlying hash function is secure so

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,019
- classical Hodgkin banner the

47
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,719
concatenation can banner and the xor

48
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,019
commander the further the former precise

49
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,930
the nice the same message under the two

50
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,680
hash function in parallel and output the

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,590
concatenate of the two and bit hashed a

52
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,790
test so that the output is of Toulon

53
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,870
beat and later out to put the XOR of the

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,599
two and beat hashed a test so the result

55
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,269
is of unbeaten this I stay parallel

56
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,989
combiner there are also cascade combiner

57
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,939
such as hash twice and therefore hush

58
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,760
the former sequentially precise the same

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,970
message under the two hash function by

60
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,540
replacing the IV of the second hash

61
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,299
function with the final state of the

62
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,810
first hash function and never did very

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,169
similar however it presides the message

64
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,810
block in a reverse order under the

65
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,260
second hash function to research line on

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,079
the security of hash come banners the

67
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,840
first is the generic attack which could

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,750
provided a upper bound on the security

69
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,150
and the SEC second yeast armed security

70
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,659
proof which provided a lower bound and

71
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,949
this talk meaning focus on the generic

72
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,560
attacks before 2004 people expect that

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,680
the concatenative two and bit ideal hash

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,609
function could provide could behave like

75
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,569
two Lampeter hash function and the XOR

76
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,540
of two and bitter hash ideal hash

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,810
function could behave like an ideal and

78
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,669
bit hash function however in 2004 drunks

79
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,930
invited a highly influential troll named

80
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,659
urge or drugs multi-collision

81
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:28,060
by iteratively john generator the

82
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,150
collision used birthday attack items one

83
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,600
could get two

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,750
to the key messages that maps the

85
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,990
starting state to the final state so

86
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,480
directly used drunks multi-collision one

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
can line to the collision attack on

88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
concatenation campaigner with - today -

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,360
and / - computations and - today and

90
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,090
computations for preimage attack so that

91
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,360
without show that the concatenate of two

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,270
hash function and cannot provide much

93
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,120
higher security than a single hash

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,190
function that is at as long as at least

95
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,960
one of the hash function use of

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,440
iterative so the next year Gaussian is

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
nary invented another kind of a multi

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,690
collision known as the expandable

99
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,390
message use a very similar process

100
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,440
however the messager less of carefully

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,420
chosen lines so that the two to the

102
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,260
messages are flies cover the whole

103
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,450
appropriate range so use this expendable

104
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,260
message calcium snare lunch a second

105
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,990
preimage attack on the empty hash

106
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,560
function the key is that the expandable

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,080
message can overcome the less

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,460
threatening in MD so this is the

109
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,820
security's nature of the MD hashed in

110
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,280
2005 this is nature maintains for almost

111
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,100
ten years until recently several attacks

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,630
show that the concatenate the hash

113
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,520
combiner cannot provide the expect

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,290
security and the most a relative one is

115
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,680
denies the second free image attack on

116
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,690
concatenation compound and they also

117
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,500
improve the preimage attack on XOR

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,480
burner so a primary attack second

119
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,730
preimage attack on concatenation

120
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,480
campaigner extends from gaussian snares

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,440
attack will not work efficiently because

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,370
of two problem the first years that one

123
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,460
have to build a message a site of

124
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,340
message that are expandable and

125
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,830
collision for both of the two hash

126
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,550
function and the second problem is that

127
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,669
one have to efficiently map the final

128
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,940
state of the expendable message to a

129
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,720
pyre of internal state at the same

130
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,200
office site so this is actually of two

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,850
and bit so to overcome the first problem

132
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,050
dinner combine the expandable message

133
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,640
message with drunks multi-collision and

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,280
cascade several basic models of proper

135
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,510
truce and lines it could build a site of

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,720
message that is expandable and collision

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,810
for both of the two hash function and to

138
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,660
solve the second problem de niro used a

139
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,910
function of graph the function of graph

140
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,700
of random mapping is a directed graph

141
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,060
whose nodes are from this ring and the H

142
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,870
are from the preimage to the image so

143
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,479
suppose that from a random node X 0 by

144
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,080
iterative it used a random item F before

145
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,590
an x and almost the square root of n

146
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,900
times iteration will you find a

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,479
collision and the value of a Oh Callie

148
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,559
Davis tape before evaluate value we say

149
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,729
this collision is an alpha note and the

150
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,510
price connected to a cycle and when

151
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,440
starting from all possible points with

152
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,800
your fund and those prices confidence

153
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,339
into trees and this tracer grafted on

154
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,470
cycles and phone

155
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,750
components

156
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,330
several components found the whole

157
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,170
function of graph so properties of

158
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,170
functional graph has been via study the

159
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,800
long time ago and those properties in

160
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,700
for example the expected number of

161
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,900
cyclic knows they expect maximums Max's

162
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,560
psycho lines exactly have been my own

163
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,770
owned and those properties has also be

164
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,090
readily explore exploited to luncheon

165
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,670
were Asif attacks and hash based Max

166
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,010
Denari found that those property can

167
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,180
also be used to a lunch efficient taxed

168
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,970
on hash campaigner so to use the

169
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,550
generate and the functional graph we

170
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,890
first fix an arbitrary message into the

171
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,140
compression functions and turn them into

172
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,470
to random map and to unlearn the my

173
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,520
things and inerrant that those notes

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,860
locate that did in the functional graph

175
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,440
have Goods properties the first year

176
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,930
that we could either gather large of

177
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,230
large side of those DP iterator as a

178
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,160
second yes that and this deviator it has

179
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,690
relatively high probability to be

180
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,339
reached when starting from a random nose

181
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,700
so Indian our second preimage attack

182
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,950
after build the simultaneous expandable

183
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,220
message instead of directly match this

184
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,890
pie or the fennel the pair of final

185
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,070
state to a state of the internal states

186
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,860
in the at the sing-off site in the

187
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,490
original computation it used the DP

188
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,010
iterator to make the connection

189
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,680
efficient the first property of DP

190
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,400
iterate

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,730
makes it efficient to find the up higher

192
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,240
of them to match the internal states at

193
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,760
the same off-site the second property of

194
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,150
DP iterates mcclee is efficient to find

195
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,050
a common message fragment that map's the

196
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,110
final state of the

197
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,490
a senior tenured expendable message to

198
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,390
the pyre of deep iterate so the key yes

199
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,959
yes find a tire of studying notes in the

200
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,120
two functional graphs that could reach

201
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,190
that the fire of deep eateries at a

202
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,029
common distance that techniques can also

203
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,399
be used to improve the preimage attack

204
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,779
an XOR combiner so and the optimum of

205
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,959
complexity this trend would be this so

206
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,450
this sound in an attack we further I

207
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,560
prove they improve the preimage attack

208
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,420
on the XOR campaigner and we propose the

209
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,610
first second preimage attack on dipper

210
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,029
hush so we found that when I used a

211
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,600
cyclic notes as the character notes

212
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,850
there will be it will bring some mode

213
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,410
advantage that is because it is easy to

214
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,690
locate the largest cycles in the

215
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,180
functional graph and collect all of the

216
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,120
cyclic notes and get the second lines by

217
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,790
repeat the cycle search algorithm

218
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,600
several times and furthermore it is

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,320
authorized to loop around the cycles to

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,920
correct the distance buyers when try to

221
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,310
reaching a pair of deep iterate most

222
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,660
specifically suppose that from a random

223
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,260
state and after divine iteration of f1

224
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,529
we could reach a cyclic note and we if

225
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,310
we know the second license of l1 Domino

226
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,570
for any eye after Devon plus items a one

227
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,010
iteration of f1 video this XR will

228
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,860
always reach these cyclic notes that is

229
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,850
same for wire and baibi so we know that

230
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,160
as long as there exists a pair of

231
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,459
integer such that the didn't distant

232
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,420
pairs and he comes to the buyers between

233
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,000
multiple cycle lines then we know there

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,089
exists

235
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,410
common distance for XR & yr reach the

236
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,769
pair of gadgets note at common distance

237
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,249
so we referred this as the correctable

238
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,120
distance buyers so now they preimage

239
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,899
attack an external company goes as

240
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,899
follows first a build the expendable

241
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,009
message and gets the two random my

242
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,439
things and locates the largest cycles

243
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:56,339
collector all of the cyclic notes and

244
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,009
this is done independently for the two

245
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,339
hash marks the two random mapping and

246
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,110
from this two sides of independent

247
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:14,110
cyclic note we find the sum travels X

248
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,680
bar Y bar and Amba we are unbiased a

249
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,230
message fragment encodes with the

250
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,370
license of the preimage and maps the x

251
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,100
bar and y bar to state who some nickels

252
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,089
today given that its value the wheel

253
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,670
lunch day a look ahead procedure to

254
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,220
developing Manos and recall their

255
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,120
distance to those gadgets nose to make

256
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,740
the fact the next steps more efficient

257
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,429
so then we start from the final state of

258
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,339
the semi tenures expendable message to

259
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,309
enumerate a message block to find a pair

260
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,920
of study notes in the two functional

261
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,779
graph - such that they reach a higher of

262
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,769
titus notes at distance that could be

263
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,779
correct that is correctable and we

264
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,240
choose from the simultaneous expandable

265
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
message with message regiment of trop

266
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,550
proper lines and to concatenate those

267
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,220
message regiment together and get the

268
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,449
preimage of the way and this techniques

269
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:33,490
can also be used to launch a done

270
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,379
seconds of free image

271
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:40,629
Tech unzipper hush so - we first

272
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,599
fine-tune denies the senior tenures

273
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:47,019
expendable message to make it that to

274
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:52,419
differ harsh we replace this structure

275
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,999
in the middle of the two computation

276
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:59,109
past and so carefully chosen lines for

277
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:02,619
the second free image is encoded in the

278
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,679
structure in advance and the beauty

279
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,879
attesting sequentially because only

280
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,639
after we finished the process in the

281
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,659
first pass we can start the process in

282
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:21,129
the second pass and the preimage attack

283
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,209
and ZBrush goes as follows to get and

284
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,449
first to get the two random mappings fi

285
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,349
@ f2 and locate the largest cycles and

286
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:37,359
get a pair of cyclic notes x bar and y

287
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:41,259
bar we referred them as a cadet nose and

288
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,169
then let's say look ahead fruit cereal

289
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,639
and start from there to target notes we

290
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,529
build two independent drugs

291
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,399
multi-collision and then start from the

292
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,439
final state of the first junk

293
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,399
multi-collision we build a simultaneous

294
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,269
expandable message across to hash

295
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,970
function and add the add and add a note

296
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,839
in the second pass and then start from

297
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,309
the final state of the second drunks

298
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,369
multi-collision we try to maps here to

299
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,638
use a message block to an internal state

300
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:24,699
of the on the original computation chain

301
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,339
and in the second pass and the immediate

302
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,700
LA we could master the in States in the

303
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,330
first pass to state Axio and then we

304
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,029
exploit messages in the second drunk

305
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,139
motet Alicia

306
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:45,340
- max XQ to a site of studying notes in

307
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,820
the functional graph of F van -

308
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,430
and compute their distance tool towards

309
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,790
the targets notes and the stole together

310
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,070
in table t1 and then we utilize the

311
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,050
messages in the first drunks

312
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,530
multi-collision to match the vital to a

313
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,750
site of studying notes in the functional

314
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,430
graph of the f2 and compute their

315
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,430
distance to words they patted note vibe

316
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:21,280
vibe and we might make a match between

317
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,810
t1 and t2 to find a pair of study notes

318
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,210
in the two functional graph that they

319
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,150
could reach a paddock the pair of

320
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,190
targets notes at a common distance and

321
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,390
the this prefix of the second preimage

322
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:48,130
has determined and then from the semi

323
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,940
tenures expandable message we choose the

324
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,920
surface of the second free image with

325
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,740
proper lines in the concatenated those

326
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,100
message regiment we get a value second

327
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,250
preimage note that in safer hush it's

328
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,040
proved it fits a message lands in the

329
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,450
middle of the two computation so a we

330
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,790
could we could optimize the computation

331
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,750
complexity by choose message lands for

332
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,200
the second preimage and it's precise the

333
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,710
message blocks in a reverse order so

334
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,320
that we could build two independent

335
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,780
drunks multi-collision to make it

336
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,880
possible to launch a meeting in the

337
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,160
middle procedure in the sequel

338
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,430
so now let's summarize the current state

339
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,990
of Hearts combiners in the following two

340
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,360
table from this to table and this

341
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,420
country contains the upper bound and the

342
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,030
lower bound from this to table we could

343
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,080
see is

344
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,149
upper bound and the lower bound is very

345
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:14,269
close therefore some come banners this

346
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:18,909
so however from the street off curves

347
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,159
between the message last and the the

348
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,090
attack complexity we can say that for

349
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,049
short messages the upper bounds and the

350
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,809
lower the gap between the upper bound

351
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,599
and the lower bound is still very huge

352
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:42,369
so that must be for the future work

353
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:46,060
thank you for your attention

354
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,780
