1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,600
so I would present you our IB from code

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,180
with Ron Patrick

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,750
first the the issue that there is in

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,300
every public key cryptosystem is to

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,840
distribute securely the key of the users

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,270
we have to be sure that we communicate

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,649
with the right users so there is several

8
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,750
way to achieve that the first solution

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,200
is to use public key infrastructure

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,360
which relies on the use of certificates

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,390
and we have to trust a lot of authority

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,460
and the other way is to use identity

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,430
based encryption where the public key of

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,010
a new juror is directly linked to with

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,950
identity and all the sacred key are

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,340
managed by an only Authority which is

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,410
called trusted Authority maybe is

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,750
technically difficult to achieve er was

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,929
invented by a sham here in Haiti for but

20
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:11,240
the first constriction only appears in

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,670
2000

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,450
currently there is for families of hobby

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,450
we can do I be from elliptic curves

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,899
pairing quadratic residues very recently

25
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:25,939
computational diffie-hellman problem and

26
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,109
from religious-based crypto for the the

27
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:36,619
three first ib is based on number theory

28
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,810
assumptions so they are not resistant

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,499
with quantum computer and only the

30
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:45,229
fourth can be used in postponed term

31
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,329
cryptography and that's why it's very

32
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,740
important to find other abilities to

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,200
construct high B in post partum

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,789
cryptography and that's what we achieved

35
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,429
we first have designed a new PKA based

36
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,119
on the Roc metric and on code base

37
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,569
cryptography with the rods metric and

38
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:15,770
the security of our new PKA is based on

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,400
a new

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,650
program the DSL problem which I

41
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,140
introduced later and with this with this

42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,599
new PK we have designed the first code

43
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,260
base I'll be in with the rock with the

44
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,769
rock matrix and we have also used

45
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:37,220
signature scheme Rock sign so no I will

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,150
present you the wrong metric first we

47
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,849
need to define fq linear codes the ff2

48
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,480
subspace of F G 1 power Hannah so

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,099
exactly like in Hamming we can represent

50
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,599
a card with matrix but with coefficient

51
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
in the field FQ M so FQ a mini Akkad

52
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,060
will be the combination of the rows of G

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:21,049
and we did not we not in NK f qm card f2

54
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,910
a million card comes with another matrix

55
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,120
the rank matrix to define it we first

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,500
need about this of fq m / fq and to

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,370
every vector of fq m power hand we can

58
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,870
associate a matrix of size M times and

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,909
each column of the matrix matrix M X

60
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,560
correspond to the coordinates of the

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,669
vector X with respect to the basis and

62
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,940
by definition the wave of record world

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,459
is the rank of the matrix and the

64
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,819
distance of two words is the rock of the

65
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,970
difference of two matrices and these

66
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,370
these definitions

67
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,049
don't depend on the choice of the basis

68
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,579
to use the rock network in cryptography

69
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,000
we need some hard problem and here the

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,608
natural hard problem is wrong stand room

71
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,858
recording which is the equivalent of the

72
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,380
Sandra medical instrument matrix so we

73
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,840
have a pirate-themed parity check matrix

74
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,940
of certain code and Sandra and we need

75
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,150
to find a vector

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,650
II said that H time e equal s with the

77
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,400
condition that the wave of e is equal to

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,210
R this problem is difficult because

79
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,610
there is a probabilistic prediction to

80
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,530
the sandworm decoding problem in the new

81
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,730
metric which is a well known np-complete

82
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,510
problem and for the decoding the

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,530
complexity of the decoding algorithm is

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,430
equal to Q power times the minimum with

85
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,880
K and km over hand so the complexity

86
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,760
depends if M is greater or less than

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,010
hell but what is important is that the

88
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,310
exponent is quadratic in n if we choose

89
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,950
all the parameters linear in Hana and of

90
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,140
course there is the decisional version

91
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,580
of this problem and we just need to the

92
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,640
problem is to distinguish sand room H

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,450
time e where e is chosen in random from

94
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,660
vector of waves are from completely

95
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,820
random vector Y so what are the

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,730
advantages of the right metric first the

97
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,890
fqm in the code are Lynette who with

98
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,430
respect to a large field so that's why

99
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,580
we can have the structured code and we

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,730
can add a compact representations so we

101
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,030
can have a small key size for crypto

102
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,150
system and the the fact there is the

103
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,360
complexity of the attack against the

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,140
wrong metric code depends on the size of

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,330
the field it's not the case for the

106
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,480
running distance was a project or even

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,760
doesn't depend on the size of the code

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,400
and another advantage is the fact that

109
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,640
the size of the codes for the rocket

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,720
weak growth grow smaller slower than for

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Hamming metrics for the same complexity

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,740
if we

113
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,840
want to solve the rarity problem with

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,389
complexity to power lambda the size of

115
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,690
the code will be linear to lambda over

116
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,660
three F but for ramming metrics it would

117
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,699
be linear for lambda square this is true

118
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,810
for random codes so there is several

119
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,090
construction with which use the wrong

120
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,550
metric in cryptography there is public

121
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,610
key encryption there is two family

122
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,190
the first one is based on the McCulloch

123
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,889
scheme and for that we need some family

124
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,169
family cards we can decode so there is a

125
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:27,539
gap between cards which the equivalent

126
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,139
of the reads element and they are rich

127
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,360
algebraic structure that's why there is

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,220
they have been attacked by overbaked and

129
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,210
the other family is the lrpc code which

130
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,210
are the equivalent of the MVP C code in

131
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,680
Hamming and of course we have a asking

132
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,180
or wrong PK and there are signature

133
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,219
schemes like your wrong sign which is

134
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,680
based on the LAPC code

135
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,509
I will repeat rapidly quickly introduce

136
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,259
you the lrpc code first we need subspace

137
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,949
V of fq m of dimension D and we consume

138
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,580
their matrix H with all this coefficient

139
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,569
in V and by definition the matrix H will

140
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,370
will be the parity check matrix of an

141
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:20,729
end

142
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,620
NK lrpc code so we can decode

143
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,719
analyticity code if we know such a

144
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:31,650
matrix but if we only have random matrix

145
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,649
a random parity check matrix we cannot

146
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,979
we cannot use the recording algorithm

147
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,589
and that's why we can use this code for

148
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,120
the macula scale such a matrix is called

149
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,100
homogeneous matrix of width D so now I

150
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,680
will present you our new public key

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,600
encryption so

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,210
first we need to generate the parameter

153
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,660
of our code we need a vector s which is

154
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,180
come off size n minus K which is

155
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,910
completely random and a matrix of size n

156
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,720
minus K times n which has to be a full

157
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,400
round and a vector e of wife our and we

158
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,160
define the vector P equal to as I

159
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,750
proceed we all don't know we also need a

160
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,590
public card we can decouple up to W our

161
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,990
arrow for the the decryption algorithm

162
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,620
the public key will be the triplets AGP

163
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,780
and the secret key is a vector has so to

164
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,080
encrypt the message m we multiply the

165
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,860
matrix a with the vector P below with

166
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,560
the Nomura's matrix U of wife W we add

167
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,120
some matrix with the Metro the message m

168
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,880
is embedded in the public code and we

169
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,910
obtained the ciphertext C X and 2 to

170
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,430
decrypt the cipher text we multiply the

171
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,870
cipher text by the secret key s with

172
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,900
with the coefficient minus 1 and we

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,800
obtain the codeword mg plus an error e

174
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,610
you and since we have chosen you as an

175
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,960
emotional matrix of for SW and the waste

176
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,820
of the vector e is how we can bound the

177
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,990
the wrong the weight of the ero EU and

178
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,960
we can then decree compute M by decoding

179
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,630
this this noisy codeword a very

180
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:56,020
important proper property to use a

181
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,910
crypto system is that there is s and P

182
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,390
are linked because since we have chosen

183
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,720
P equal as april's e is a difference the

184
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
rank of the different

185
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,310
between P and si si is is low that's why

186
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,720
H will be useful for the IB so I will

187
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,510
introduce we have introduced a new

188
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,260
problem to prove the security of our

189
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,330
crypto systems with wrong support

190
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,420
learning problem we this problem in this

191
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,610
program we have a matrix a completely

192
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,230
random and the product of a times u

193
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,750
where u is the homogeneous way

194
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,000
emotionals

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,370
matrix of weight W and the goal of the

196
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,760
problem is to recover the support of you

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,250
by support I mean the subspace generated

198
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,380
by the coordinates of view we can see

199
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,350
this problem as multiple instance of the

200
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,330
rsd problem which c CI can be seen of

201
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,500
the product of a times a vector of

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,930
weight the value but the difference is

203
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,420
that all the the support of all the rows

204
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,700
are in the same space V of course we can

205
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,560
we can define the decisional version of

206
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,380
this problem which is to distinguish the

207
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,750
matrix a you from completely random

208
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,660
matrix Y under the assumption that the

209
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,440
era's are dr SL is hard or public-key

210
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,060
encryption is semantically secure so now

211
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,690
i will i will instigate in the

212
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,480
complexity of aerosol so as I said if we

213
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,290
just have one if n prime equal one we

214
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,300
just have one syndrome so aerosol is

215
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,530
equivalent to the era's D problem and

216
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,140
when and when n queen is large enough

217
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,460
this problem become easy so I will

218
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,480
explain it briefly

219
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,779
we just consider the subspace W

220
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,460
generated by the clone of the matrix a

221
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,710
you so fq subspace and if n 3 is greater

222
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,360
than n time W the subspace W correspond

223
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,570
to the walls of space a time leap over

224
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,680
hand so we can check if for any subspace

225
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,150
V of dimension 1 if the subspace 8e

226
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,529
power n is included in W and then we can

227
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:00,740
recover V this way for our crypto sister

228
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,790
for crypto system we are in the case

229
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,800
where in the intermediate intermediate

230
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:17,720
case and I will so we will still

231
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,779
consider the subspace W generated by the

232
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,720
column of the matrix a you but this time

233
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,990
we will also consider as a code C which

234
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,260
is the set of the vector X such that a

235
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,339
time X belongs to W it's an FQ linear

236
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,510
code and it has the property that the

237
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,839
small codeword of C are coming a linear

238
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,990
combination of the con of U so if we can

239
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,170
compute this small weight code words we

240
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,510
will able to compute V and then to solve

241
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,650
our problem so we have adapted the

242
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,720
generic decoding algorithm to this code

243
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,660
and we obtain an external shell gain

244
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,610
proportional to Q power n prime over n

245
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,020
time the minimum of K km over n but the

246
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,060
complexity for this attack is still

247
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,000
exponential okay now I can present you

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,540
our identity based encryption so there's

249
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,750
two main difficulties for designing an

250
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,759
ID

251
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,799
the first is we need to to have a public

252
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,919
key encryption with dense space for the

253
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,559
public key and the second difficulty is

254
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,649
only the trusted Authority can be able

255
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,730
to compute the secret key of often user

256
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,239
and the problem is in our wrong PK we do

257
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,959
the exact opposite we first generate the

258
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,609
the secret key s and then we compute the

259
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:13,660
public key as a and the public key

260
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,929
is passed

261
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:24,160
yes space is passed so we have to do the

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,499
opposed to to transform I run TK into an

263
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:38,139
IDE we need to to add some some trapdoor

264
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,389
in the matrix a in order to to invert

265
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,989
the function so we are we have a which

266
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:51,519
is a public master key of hobby and any

267
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,809
vector P of length n can be a public key

268
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,649
often a fan user so we need to find a

269
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,809
vector s so that P minus s a is small in

270
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,189
order to to use or to use wrong key K

271
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,638
and this problem is exactly the problem

272
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,439
of the signature in code base

273
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,799
cryptography so we will have the

274
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,949
trapdoor in the master public key a by

275
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,409
using the signature scheme wrong sign

276
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:31,480
how wrong sign works wrong sign is also

277
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,460
based on the lrpc code

278
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,679
so the problem we consider a matrix h

279
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,590
prime which is in two parts the first

280
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,110
part is the homogeneous matrix of ID so

281
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,870
it defines the lrpc code and we add some

282
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,530
random

283
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,970
in order to hide the structure of the

284
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,490
record and we call such a card not

285
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,530
mounted lrpc

286
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:01,059
our latissimus and the matrix H prime H

287
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,130
prime will be the secret key of the of

288
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,980
the upfront sign and to hide the

289
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,309
structure we multiply H frame by to run

290
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,490
to invertible matrix P and Q so the

291
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,549
public matrix will be pH P and Q and now

292
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:28,059
we can we can design our IB him sorry

293
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,280
first yeah the wrong sign has as an

294
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,200
property that the signature are

295
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,570
constitutionally indispensable from the

296
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,890
uniform resolution which is useful for

297
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,270
the album

298
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:54,480
so our IB works first we generate public

299
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,309
public master key which is generator

300
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,429
matrix of an allopathic code and we also

301
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,630
have metric G like in the wrong decay

302
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,289
and the trap the master secret key will

303
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:14,620
be the trapdoor of wrong sign the key

304
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,799
derivation to use a key derivation we

305
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,980
need an Oracle H in order to embed any

306
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,679
identity in the space of the of the

307
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,710
signature from sign and to compute the

308
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:38,140
secret the secret key of an identity the

309
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,120
trusted Authority run the algorithm

310
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,690
wrong sign with the trapdoor T and we

311
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,950
obtain by by definition we obtain s so

312
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,730
that as I'm an SP the rank of si minus P

313
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,870
is below our and since we have this

314
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,809
property we can use wrong PK with the

315
00:19:58,809 --> 00:19:59,410
mattress

316
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,480
a to encrypt and decrypt the any message

317
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,100
em so the the matrix a plays two roles

318
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,860
one you can be it is used as a public

319
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,570
method in public lyrics for the

320
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,320
encryption and the decryption and it is

321
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,200
also used in wrong sign to by the

322
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,169
Transit Authority to compute the secret

323
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:36,480
key of any users so the security of our

324
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,350
IB is based on on the assumption that a

325
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,990
la PC plus code is indistinguishable

326
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,520
from a random code and under this

327
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,010
assumption the security of a high B II

328
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,129
is reduced to the security of wrong PK

329
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,590
I'll give us some parameters we have

330
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,419
public master key of a few megabytes and

331
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,750
who is very large because of the the

332
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,880
fact that assume that you in wrong sign

333
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,549
are not statistically close to the

334
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,320
uniform but only computationally close

335
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,690
and the bound depend on Q that's why we

336
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,890
need a huge a real app but of course the

337
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,730
goal of article is not to design

338
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,750
optimized algorithm but more to have

339
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:39,220
maybe a baton of their assumption in

340
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,190
conclusion there is to several open

341
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,770
questions so first one is to find a

342
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,710
social decision to the aerosol problem

343
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,710
because the security of Ron PK is based

344
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,250
on the decision and the decision version

345
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,929
of this problem and for the currently

346
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:01,289
the best attack again the decision

347
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,630
version of this problem is to solve the

348
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,049
constitutional conclusion L problem but

349
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:09,720
we don't have

350
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,990
in your addiction and the second

351
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,860
question is how to design an IB in the

352
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,700
in the M in metric because as I said

353
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,740
with the wrong metric we can use the

354
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,470
parameter M of the size of the field in

355
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,899
order to - it is useful to to construct

356
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:39,389
the wrong PK and we cannot adapt to the

357
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,590
idea to running so if we want to maybe

358
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,620
in Hamming we in ramming metric we need

359
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,199
a completely different idea

360
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,649
thank you for a for attention if there

361
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:56,480
is any patient

362
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,539
