1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,930
today I will talk about conditional

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,150
disclosure of secret Berlin Nandhini

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,160
reconstruction I'm changing this is

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,280
drawing work with sphenoid and ho Tech

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,770
so you have heard the talk about

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,720
conditional disclosure of secret or city

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,590
s already

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,860
here's quick recap of the definition

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,500
there are three parties Alice who hold

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,010
the predicted Bob who hold the input I

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,090
and Charlie who knows both Evan I

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,070
Allison Bob also knows a bit secret and

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,470
they want to disclose the secret to

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,329
charlie is and only if I Phi equals one

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,899
so this model

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,180
it's like multi-party competition but

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,390
with minimum communication Alice and Bob

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,700
cannot talk to each other but they share

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,530
a random random tip this random tape is

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,030
private in the sense that Charlie cannot

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,600
read it Alice and Bob also each send a

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
message to Charlie they cannot receive

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,350
any message from Charlie after this

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,259
Charlie should be able to learn secret

25
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,340
if I Phi equals to one for privacy the

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,319
FI equals zero

27
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,009
Charlie should learn nothing about

28
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,099
secret we are aiming for information

29
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:24,399
theoretical security therefore like

30
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,670
Wi-Fi equals zero the joint distribution

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,369
of the message should be simulated by a

32
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,580
simulator who doesn't know the secret so

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,069
far it's the same as the previous talk

34
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,490
but in this one we stick to the case

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,020
where the Alice input you should

36
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,619
consider that as a truth table so

37
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,660
Charlie 'nor learn the secret if and

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,789
only if the ice index in the truth table

39
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:54,280
is one city as is very useful in the

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,360
people who are in paper by curtain air

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,200
is shy crucial a vase and melted milk in

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,500
it was used to protect data privacy in

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,200
peer schemes it also implies secret

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,650
servings of Abaddon cough and it also

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,469
looks like one time actually built based

46
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,250
encryption

47
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,380
and they can be lifted to a multi-time

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,500
at rest encryption it's also an

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,740
interesting primitive on its own so

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,170
let's have a toy construction to see how

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,510
it works here the privacy it's just a

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,660
sorry the private random tape we read

53
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,209
and beat of random bit Bob Bob he sent

54
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,260
the secret bit X or the ass random bit

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,580
this is like a one-time pad then what I

56
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,840
just do is natural

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,480
he sent or the random beat RJ is such

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,280
that D I equals 1 at E 2 X 1 so the

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,660
secret it's one time headed by RI and RI

60
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,480
its licked by Alice if and only if di

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,489
equals one so we have both privacy and

62
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,680
the correctness in this scheme the Box

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,690
communication is minimized one bit

64
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,140
Alice communications at most an bit.when

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,680
TI x1 bob reconstruct the secret by

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,440
wearisome or simpler a simple way he

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,560
just XOR the secrets of the bits sent by

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,150
ball and one bit send bells we have

69
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,120
another toy construction this one

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,890
LS communication complexity it's

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,930
minimized one bit Alice send the secret

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,930
XOR with all the random bit RJ is such

73
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,290
that our TJ x is 0 and for Bob Bob sand

74
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,420
all random bit except all right so you

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,420
can see here there's only one and send

76
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,890
secret bit which is i RI it's used to

77
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,200
encrypt secret if and only if DJ a DI

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,780
it's 0 therefore you we also propose

79
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,168
privacy and crackers in this case when

80
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,728
charlie want to reconstruct the secret

81
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,160
when di it's one he also do something

82
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,870
very simple

83
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,840
he took the beach sent by Alice XOR with

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,310
some of the page sent by Bob so in the

85
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,810
previous two examples

86
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,420
Charlie reconstruct the secret by X or

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,090
some of the bit he received which is a

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,419
linear function mode - we said a Sidious

89
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,630
have linear reconstruction if Bob

90
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,270
reconstruct a secret by apply a linear

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,620
function on the message he received now

92
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,830
already you have seen - construction for

93
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,530
city s this linear reconstruction the

94
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,389
communication capacity with NY + 1 n you

95
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,460
can do a balancing between them and get

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,760
other city s also linear reconstruction

97
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,650
but the communication capacity is square

98
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,040
root n this is also the best know before

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,960
us okay que creen IDs and V they prove

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,470
that if the reconstruction is linear

101
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,419
square root n is actually the best you

102
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,200
can get in the same paper they show a

103
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,500
log and lower bound for unrestricted in

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,800
customers reconstruction so as you can

105
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,410
see there is the expansion gap between

106
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,540
the lower bound and the best

107
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,419
reconstruction a best construction if

108
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,640
you want to improve it and get a better

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,430
city s you need this reconstruction to

110
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,850
use some nonlinear technique so here

111
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,900
comes our works firstly present city s

112
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,930
with cube root reconstruction of return

113
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,600
communication capacity and the quadratic

114
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,450
reconstruction this is also tight

115
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,900
instance that cube root n is optimal for

116
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,280
recomposed for quadratic reconstruction

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,470
we get other construction such that ok

118
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,590
this time we have some polynomial

119
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,510
communication complexity but as the

120
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,729
treat of the reconstruction it's more

121
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,419
complicated so you should get idea now

122
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,410
that okay we need nonlinear techniques

123
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,650
but where are they coming form a turnout

124
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,289
slag the correct place to looking for

125
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,229
nonlinear technique it's from two server

126
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,930
information silicon private information

127
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,800
or two so into severe

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,190
they are to server each hold a table and

129
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,539
the climb how to index the client want

130
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,120
to learn as index in the table this

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
oddly King his index okay you can see

132
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
it's somehow similar to Sidious there

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,509
are three parties they are information

134
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,330
through Elko dealers the database there

135
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,729
it's index and also there it's the

136
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,199
square root and communication

137
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,729
construction construction yeah but one

138
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,340
big difference is that we have better

139
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,479
scheme for appear for peer we have a

140
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,159
cube root and communication complexity

141
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,550
scheme and also recently developing

142
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,030
these date construct the first sub

143
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,520
polynomial communication complex live

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,490
here so metric restraints that

145
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,789
okay can we import technique from peer -

146
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,690
suvir's beamer

147
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,810
is shy comparison to Solaris they do

148
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,789
something similar they import technique

149
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:52,659
from for server peer to PSL PSM it's

150
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,099
kind of similar to cities encouraged by

151
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,069
previous result we also import

152
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:02,669
techniques from cities from here we can

153
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,699
suggest this tool with cube root turn

154
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,889
communicate chemistry and support Gnomeo

155
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,779
communicate capacity actually we have a

156
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,270
quite general transformation from to

157
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,240
serve up here to cities as long as the

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,319
peer satisfy some mailed properties

159
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,569
let's see first a quick definition of

160
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,719
peer to server a client client knows the

161
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:31,569
index client general query and sent to

162
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,179
the server server answers client get

163
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,250
answers and the client learns a century

164
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,969
for privacy

165
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,309
each server individually learns nothing

166
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,610
about the index

167
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,579
okay so we would like gradually transfer

168
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,790
this picture to a Sidious the first

169
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,910
thing I'd like to do is to split the

170
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,250
client in the two piece the one on the

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,450
top right

172
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,670
he only taking care of general inquiries

173
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,670
and sent to server divan on the bottom

174
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,210
left

175
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,270
he kept answer from the server and he

176
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,380
ought put the eyes index so the first

177
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,980
property be assumed on the pier is that

178
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,410
the queries actually forms an additive

179
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,430
secretary offer vector you I hear you I

180
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,240
to you it's just some public everyone no

181
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,570
a vector ok the server answered query I

182
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,270
don't know I don't care how they do it

183
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,270
let HDD note how the server answered

184
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,900
query our second assumption

185
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,460
it's like decline we get the signal gets

186
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,120
us entry by doing some linear work in

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,030
particular okay assuming you are the

188
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,610
client you get answer which is a vector

189
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,930
and so you inner producted with UI you

190
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,640
subtract the two inner product the

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,090
difference would be di so you may ask

192
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,090
oh this looks quite specialized but

193
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,880
actually it's not as long as you have

194
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,860
appear where the cly output as entry by

195
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,190
doing something linear and the answer he

196
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,340
receive you can transform this pier to

197
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,050
appear of this basic equation the the

198
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,580
total communication comes say the

199
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,860
complexity would increase a bit but only

200
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,610
by a constant factor

201
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,290
assuming we have both these properties

202
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,530
we are ready to transforming this pier

203
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,640
to a cydia scheme first thing insidious

204
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,580
there's a secret bit we need to embed it

205
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,150
somewhere

206
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,930
we gave the bit to the top line so the

207
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,290
client would falling if the pit is 1

208
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,350
nothing changed if the bit is 0 he

209
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,360
actually sent same query to pull server

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,520
everyone else in this graph they just

211
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,170
pretend nothing have happened and do the

212
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,170
same thing so what would the bottom cry

213
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,150
output here it's

214
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,110
output as x di the secrets are when the

215
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,820
secret beat ice equals one

216
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,970
he just opted di as previously when

217
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,980
secret beat zero he's actually

218
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,520
subtracting two identical in a product

219
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,920
therefore the output is zero so pin them

220
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,450
together the odd food is ours x di o

221
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,270
heist x di is actually what we need for

222
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,020
Sidious Azumi our Charlie you get as x

223
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,350
di what does it tells you when T is X 1

224
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,980
it gave you the secret when T X 0 it

225
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,400
hides the secret okay now it's my

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,150
favorite part so the top server it's

227
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,810
actually Alice knowing the database good

228
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,450
the table kleine it's actually Bob

229
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,980
knowing index secret good there's no

230
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,480
need to sign the random stream to else

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,550
they can simply read it from their

232
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,150
private random stream both client and

233
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,900
server in bottom are Hardy

234
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,570
so let's merge the truth to Charlie this

235
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,530
business whole picture looks like oh

236
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,970
let's check the city see there's games

237
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,750
already is it correct

238
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,170
it is from Alice message you can compute

239
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,080
blue inner product from the Bob's

240
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,910
message you can compute a green a

241
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,090
product subtract them get STI which

242
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,260
which is what Charlie should learn ok so

243
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,780
it is private assume you are the

244
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,790
simulator you want to simulate the

245
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,900
Chinese view without knowing secret s

246
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,180
okay Bob's message cool it's immutable

247
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,040
it's just a random string but you don't

248
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,140
know how to simulate Alice one actually

249
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,660
Alice message long you can simulate it

250
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,960
because it doesn't even contain us but

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,890
the drawing distribution is hard but now

252
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,310
let's have a daydream Alice message it's

253
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,560
used to compute this inner product

254
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,110
what if Alice just send this inner

255
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,190
product it's just one bit

256
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,900
and actually when di equals zero from

257
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,320
this equation you can compute what Ellis

258
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,460
would argue in two cent

259
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,390
so this is actually simulate ball but

260
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,360
where sadly Ellis cannot stand this in

261
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,270
the product because le cannot compute it

262
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,280
at least that doesn't know sigh that's

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,980
knows you I Bob knows I Bob know cui so

264
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,830
babka health so the current situations

265
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,170
like Alice knows a vector

266
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,380
Bob knows a vector they want Charlie to

267
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,080
learn the inner product without leaking

268
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,620
extra information it's doable it's very

269
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,840
actually very simple it's like actually

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,740
very simple protocol for this and this

271
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,260
send a one-time pad of his/her vector

272
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,660
and Bob bobs and inner product between

273
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,160
the pad and his vector what does Charlie

274
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,980
do Charlie actually also knows this

275
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,890
bulbs vector so Charlie to inner product

276
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,270
between UI and what Alice sent subtract

277
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,840
what Bob sent then Charlie would get

278
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,430
this inner part so we still have

279
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,560
correctness so how about privacy

280
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,180
this message is easy to simulate it's

281
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,540
just random string and again the extra

282
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,330
bits and pipe or you can compute it from

283
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,760
the equation and bottom so actually you

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,600
also have privacy so now actually you

285
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,380
have the transformation already but in

286
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,300
this transformation we assume two

287
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,640
properties which is listed in the top of

288
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,430
the slides okay I want to make some

289
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,730
comment here the first one we actually

290
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,640
don't need the first property without

291
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,950
word without this property the

292
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,050
transformation would look ugly but it

293
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,670
still survives the second C name all pr2

294
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,950
super clear you know they satisfy both

295
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,910
property in at all therefore they can be

296
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,640
transferred to city s with same

297
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,060
communication complexity

298
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,260
and one more thing is like if you

299
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,580
remember like Charlie he act us he act

300
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,610
posting as the server and Klein at the

301
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,690
bottle therefore his complexity is at

302
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,380
least as much as the server in appear so

303
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,600
for cube root ampere the server's

304
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
complexity the server need to compute a

305
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
quadratic function so it transformed to

306
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,260
a PDS like Charlie need to do quadratic

307
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,140
evaluation and seemed similarly in a sub

308
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,080
polynomial P R the server to something

309
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,320
complicated high degree then then

310
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,140
transfer to Sidious charlie also need to

311
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,080
evaluate a complicated function so this

312
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,510
is ok let's have a concrete one let's

313
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,320
see how we transform the sub polynomial

314
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,850
P R to Sidious so what does the vector

315
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,930
UI looks like the vector UI is actually

316
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,940
just a it's called matching vector

317
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,450
family

318
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,560
it's bench of short vectors such that in

319
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,320
the product vector with itself is 0 in

320
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,180
productive vector wisdom some other

321
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,850
vector is nonzero and if you can't find

322
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,440
better like shorter imagine vectors then

323
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,440
you would have better peer and also get

324
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,050
better cities and the server does ok

325
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,510
what I want you to observe from this why

326
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,450
it's like this is what the server tools

327
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:17,390
in the sub polynomial here and also like

328
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,839
this is what the child need to evaluate

329
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,280
he need to compute the inner product an

330
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,730
exponent which is very high degree

331
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,560
polynomial if it's not right around

332
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,570
exponent so this is not technical part I

333
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,490
want to say to summary we get two pair

334
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,000
are two new cydia schemes while with

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,490
cube root n connection messy which also

336
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,300
tied for quadratic reconstruction

337
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,090
one with polynomial communicate

338
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,610
chemistry the technique borrowed from

339
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,510
Pierre if you have an upir it's very

340
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,240
likely you can also transform it to a

341
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,230
better cities and if you know forbidden

342
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,679
graph our result also implies better

343
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,650
forbidden gorf also implies better

344
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,000
secret Sharon screams forbidden Wharf so

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,130
this is hot picture looks like there

346
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,010
used to be exponential gap here we

347
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,740
somehow narrow it down but these are

348
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,950
still room left and big questions what's

349
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,580
the right answer

350
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,560
thank you very much

351
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,159
[Applause]
