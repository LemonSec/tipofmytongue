1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,750
good morning everybody so I'm going to

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,600
talk about the our work on quantum

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,760
security of an net and this is a joint

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,850
work with fans own and this is my

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,950
attempt at illustrating and Mac under

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,150
contract proposed Pirie and so what I'm

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,250
going to do is this I'm going to first

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,779
talk about briefly about quantum

9
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,760
security in general and then as a

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,770
warm-up I'm going to talk about cascade

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,840
construction and then finally I'm going

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,559
to talk about and mech so about quantum

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,910
security we in a sense we can say that

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,250
quantum security is a stronger version

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,770
of post quantum cryptography where the

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,510
adversary not only has a quantum

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,059
computation or capability but also the

18
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,390
quantum computation and quantum

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,320
communication capability with this

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,300
environment of course there can be

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
formalized as adversaries ability to

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,219
make quantum super post series to its

23
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,710
Oracle so like a light classical case

24
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,470
instead of making a query X and

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,840
receiving Oracle answer who acts the

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,750
adversary can prepare its curry as a

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,880
superposition of different messages X

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
and getting the again superposed answers

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,229
so perhaps one motivation for this is

30
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,410
from the quantum random Oracle model so

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,569
if we regard a random Oracle as a I

32
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,220
really shouldn't health hash function

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,849
then we can see that any quantum

34
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:35,080
adversary can evaluate the such hash

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,590
function in superposition why well maybe

36
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,259
perhaps in order to do a reverse search

37
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,830
for anyway in that case we can think

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,259
that the traditional formulation of the

39
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,479
random Oracle model doesn't do justice

40
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,489
in formulating the adversary or

41
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:54,520
capability of quantum adversary in such

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,880
steady

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,220
so therefore the correct notion seems to

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,319
be the quantum random Oracle model where

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,140
the adversary can make quantum

46
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,119
superposed theories to the random Oracle

47
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,729
in a sense the quantum security is the

48
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,649
full generalization of the quantum

49
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,419
random Oracle model and then now the

50
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,250
adversary can make quantum superboost

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,439
here is to all of its Oracles for

52
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,519
example when you are talking about

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,640
encryption schemes than

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,940
a Christian Oracle and for district

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,720
Easter signature therapy signing fairies

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,569
so despite this is a relatively recent

57
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,760
area there are already many interesting

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,910
results both positive and negative and

59
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,500
so now there are some constructions

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,240
involving quantum random Oracle's and

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,120
there are some PRF max encryption

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,100
schemes and signature schemes and so on

63
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,680
and on the other end there are also many

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
interesting or texts these or texts are

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,510
especially interesting because they are

66
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,050
successful quantum attacks on the

67
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,370
classically secure schemes

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,650
examples include Evan master cypher

69
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,410
Mubarak of cipher and cbc Meg and other

70
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,420
block cipher based perhaps and

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,660
especially we all these works are based

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,459
on quantum algorithm called Simon's

73
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,180
algorithm in clever way and especially

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,480
the last work about CBC Megan others are

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,150
the more present in crypto last year and

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,340
that actually partially answers the

77
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,120
question posed by Bonnie and sundry can

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,400
we construct a quantum secure PRF for a

79
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,680
large domain from a quantum secure PRF

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,750
for a small domain in particular to the

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,370
cbc-mac where I make instructions give

82
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,500
quantum secure perhaps in other words

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,900
can we do care of domain extension in

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,329
the quantum setting and so well they say

85
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,190
that this force in EC max case the

86
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,680
answer is no but you know since our work

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,070
is complementary to that so that we have

88
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,700
proved that an Mac HTML a Mac and some

89
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,860
other schemes are quantum secure of

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,519
course if the underlying small key F is

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,700
quantum secure the main ingredients we

92
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,489
have used for this our first oracle

93
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,829
indistinguishability of functions and a

94
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,570
notion we call cure of security and the

95
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,350
random leakage so I'm going to first

96
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,420
talk about cascade construction the

97
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,750
Cascade construction is I start with a

98
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,149
small PRF where the key space is equals

99
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,418
the codomain and we can build a larger

100
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,150
PRF simply by processing iteratively

101
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,190
process each message block one by one

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,260
the result is the Cascade construction

103
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,330
here I'll illustrating the three-block

104
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,999
case

105
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:34,209
and classically the cascade construction

106
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,249
is known to be secure if the number of

107
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,829
message blocks are fixed and the result

108
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:41,139
is done by paleri Canadian Krawczyk in

109
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,129
1996 and the proof uses a two-level

110
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,379
hybrid argument in one level one level

111
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,449
it's over the message blocks and another

112
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,419
level is over the Curie's and I'll

113
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,209
briefly illustrate I'll really show the

114
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,269
outline of the proof so the proof

115
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:01,289
consists of a successive games

116
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:04,839
indistinguishable games and each all of

117
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,939
them are identical except how the Oracle

118
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,069
is prepared of course in the original

119
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:11,709
original game we have the Cascade

120
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,610
construction and we move to the next

121
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,159
game where the first PRF instance is

122
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,529
switched to a uniform random function of

123
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,269
course this change is indistinguishable

124
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:25,749
due to the PRF security and in the next

125
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,909
game we are going to eliminate one more

126
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:30,759
PRF instance by a uniform random

127
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,949
function and you are going to do this

128
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,379
once more and we finally arrive at the

129
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,659
game where the Oracle is uniform random

130
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:41,079
function but in order that this outline

131
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,289
works each successive games should be

132
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,969
indistinguishable from the previous one

133
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:51,489
so we can see that the each Oracle

134
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:54,610
theory to the left hand side part should

135
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,769
be indistinguishable no Oracle carry to

136
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,799
the right hand side part to allow this

137
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:03,309
switch but we can if you look at this

138
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,829
carefully then we can see that this does

139
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,929
not involve just single care of instance

140
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:09,719
but actually many care of instances

141
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,639
because whenever the adversary makes a

142
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,189
theory of Z of X that'll produce a

143
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:18,099
randomly chosen PRF key role of Z so

144
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,409
therefore if the adversary makes put our

145
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,019
true queries then there are two keys are

146
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:27,039
involved so there are Q PRF instances to

147
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,659
handle this situation

148
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,569
in the classical proof a notion called

149
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,969
multi or occur security was given so

150
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,129
this is not complicated it simply says

151
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,499
that if you have polynomial number of

152
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,199
independent PRF instances that will be

153
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,240
indistinguishable from the same number

154
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,060
of

155
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,770
independent uniform random functions and

156
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,990
of course that can be proved by a simple

157
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,490
hybrid argument so now the multi Oracle

158
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,660
setting is ready now we can do argue

159
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,210
that we can carry out the outline that I

160
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,110
have explained

161
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,690
so whenever the adversary makes total

162
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,210
two queries then we can prepare your

163
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,520
queue instances and then using this

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,250
multi Oracle indistinguishability we can

165
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,430
simulate the transition from this Oracle

166
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,970
to that Oracle so that allows the that's

167
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,919
more or less the outline of the class

168
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,990
for security proof of the cascade

169
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,419
construction unfortunately that doesn't

170
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,889
really work for the quantum setting

171
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,660
because obviously if you look at this

172
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,419
proof then it is assumed that each

173
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,750
individual queries are on superposed and

174
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,550
of course that's not true in the quantum

175
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,810
security setting so but one interesting

176
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,810
thing is that at least one special case

177
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,970
of the Cascade construction was already

178
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,880
proved to be quantum secure and that is

179
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,580
in fact the ggm construction given by

180
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,410
called Reichhold Wasser and Macaulay

181
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,860
this is a way to construct a PRF out of

182
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,700
a length doubling PRG Andi 2012 xandrie

183
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,550
showed that ggm is quantum secure if the

184
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,850
underlying PRG is quantum secure quantum

185
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,620
secure so let me so one of sort of a

186
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,360
simple observation we can make is this

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,610
if we modify the notation a little bit

188
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,010
we can immediately see that GCM is in

189
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,840
fact a special case of the Cascade

190
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,120
construction when the underlying Calif

191
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,630
can process only one single bit so in

192
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,320
fact that can be readily extended to the

193
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,620
case if the underlying PRF has a

194
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,450
polynomial size domain because such a

195
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,950
PRF is in fact PRG so what we need to do

196
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,929
is to remove this restriction to the

197
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,490
general case so to do that let me

198
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,980
briefly review under this approach for

199
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,730
proving

200
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,459
quantum security of GGN so first step is

201
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,709
to repackaging the classical ggm

202
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,270
security using a new notion called

203
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,959
indistinguishability and then he proved

204
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,270
the Oracle indistinguishability using

205
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,279
new techniques suitable for a quantum

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,630
setting and so let's talk about worker

207
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,120
indistinguishability suppose we have our

208
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,310
true probability distributions is 0 and

209
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,459
d1 and of course we know what do you

210
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,750
mean that these two are

211
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,510
indistinguishable so one it is hard to

212
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,029
distinguish one sample of d0 from the

213
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,160
other sample from d1 in that case we say

214
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,610
that these two are indistinguishable

215
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,860
then we can say that the 0 and the 1 are

216
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,740
all indistinguishable if it is hard to

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,680
distinguish arbitrarily sized indexed

218
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,140
family of independent and identically

219
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,110
distributed samples from B 0 and from

220
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,220
the same kind of samples from d1 and we

221
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,160
are going to eventually applies to PRF

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,670
so we need to talk about iid samples of

223
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,970
functions so let's be a little bit more

224
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,149
for now suppose is an index set and

225
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,700
suppose G is a function distribution

226
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,240
here this notation Y to the X is a very

227
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,300
important function space from X to Y and

228
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,490
imagine Y and X are like the bit strings

229
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,510
space of meat strings and then I'm going

230
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,220
to define this e to the I this is a

231
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,260
distribution of random functions of type

232
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,940
I to D Y to the X so how do you define

233
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,149
it

234
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,029
each image F of I is chosen

235
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,310
independently according to the

236
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,649
distribution T remember that this

237
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,360
distribution is a function distribution

238
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
so therefore each fi is in fact a random

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,420
function from X to Y and in fact we can

240
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,000
take a slightly different but equivalent

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,630
point of view by regard considering the

242
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,589
whoring isomorphism so simply Y to the X

243
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,440
to the I is isomorphic to the Y to the I

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,860
times X Y because as I told you before

245
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,459
fi is a function from X to Y so this can

246
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,529
be evaluated on any people what happened

247
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,690
ok any point X so but the effect is that

248
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,610
it

249
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,149
in fact this gives you a function of INX

250
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:16,639
together because these two viewpoints

251
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,009
are completely interchangeable we can

252
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,259
regard this DDI as a distribution of

253
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,989
random functions from I times X to I

254
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,519
okay so now we are ready to talk about

255
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,410
Oracle indistinguishability of functions

256
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,920
suppose I is an index set and we have we

257
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,309
are given two function distributions and

258
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,929
I'm going to define that they are Oracle

259
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,600
indistinguishable if it is hard to

260
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,779
distinguish one iid sample of d0 from

261
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,379
another iid sample of t1 by any quantum

262
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,569
adversary who can make quantum furies so

263
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:55,100
and also we can talk about or occur

264
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,149
security of Kiev's using this we say

265
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,639
that PRF is Oracle secure if it is a

266
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,379
rockery indistinguishable from a uniform

267
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,529
random function in impact that turns out

268
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,529
to be exactly the notion required for

269
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,779
carrying out security proof for the

270
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,739
Cascade construction let me show you I

271
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:19,220
so here we have a indexer I and for each

272
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,600
index I we need to pick a uniform random

273
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
instance independent random instance of

274
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,549
PRF and to do that we need to pick a

275
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,790
secret key for this particular I that in

276
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,699
fact gives us a uniform random function

277
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,369
kappa from the indexer i to the key

278
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:40,639
space of F and we need to compare this

279
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,579
Oracle with another Oracle chosen by

280
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,790
choosing a uniform independent random

281
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,910
function for each index but if you think

282
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,790
about it that's simply a uniform random

283
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,980
function of I and X together

284
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,179
so in fact Oracle security gives us this

285
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,699
in indistinguishability which exactly is

286
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,069
the right shape for carrying out the

287
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:05,449
security proof for the Cascade

288
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,419
construction so the only remaining

289
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:11,329
problem is so is the PRF F or a curse

290
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,929
secure the answer is yes in fact it can

291
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,419
be more slightly more general and if we

292
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,970
have to efficiently sample in this to

293
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,129
visual function distributions then we

294
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,080
can prove that easy row and you honor

295
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,540
indistinguishable in the class car

296
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,860
setting the proof would be even easier

297
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,200
so it can be done by simple hybrid

298
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,450
argument over Curie's but of course in

299
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,920
the quantum setting that is not possible

300
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,370
but again we can rely on a technique

301
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,860
developed by sundry for the context of

302
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,860
the ggm security that's we can switch to

303
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,270
small range distribution

304
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,980
so unlike the iid distribution in the

305
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,130
small range distribution each image fi

306
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,770
are not chosen independently instead

307
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,860
we've fixed a small number R and we are

308
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,490
going to first choose our number of

309
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,190
independent samples and each F eyes are

310
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,380
chosen to be unit for me one of those

311
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,900
are samples so there will be necessarily

312
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,850
lots of duplicates and only there are

313
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,170
only our genuine independent copies and

314
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,730
what sundry showed in the security of

315
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,310
ggm setting is that it is

316
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,590
indistinguishable from switching from

317
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,350
the iid distribution to the small ranges

318
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,990
distribution so here what I need to do

319
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,870
is to compare small range distributions

320
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,560
of d0 and d1 and in fact now we are can

321
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,320
do is to we can do the hybrid argument

322
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,840
over those are independent copies so

323
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,840
gradually one by one we can switch from

324
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,030
[Music]

325
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,340
switch those are samples from d0 and d1

326
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,980
to finish the proof further or

327
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,670
indistinguishability well now we are

328
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,190
ready everything's done essentially done

329
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,650
for cascade so if FP is a secure PRF

330
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,040
then according to previous argument F

331
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,860
who is Oracle secure then using the

332
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,570
worker security we can carry out the

333
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,970
hybrid argument for the Cascade

334
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,190
construction which proves the quantum

335
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,270
security of cascade cascade construction

336
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,270
ok let's move on to the N Mac n Meg is

337
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,970
simply cascade construction with

338
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,670
additional post-processing by additional

339
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,280
independent PRF instance and so it

340
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,020
requires two keys one for the Cascade

341
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,610
and another for the post-processing and

342
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,200
that post-processing prevents the

343
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,510
extension attack so unlike the case of

344
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,720
the Cascade construction you know

345
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,370
processing variable-length messages and

346
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,720
classically of course the security of an

347
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,400
Mecca is proven and when you try to

348
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,220
adapt those classical proofs to the

349
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,170
quantum setting we were not able to do

350
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,589
that so we have devised a direct hybrid

351
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,110
argument using an extended version of

352
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,070
Oracle indistinguishability and for do

353
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,680
this we need an additional property of a

354
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,790
secure PRF so but before that the first

355
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,610
step in our proof is to replace this

356
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,730
outer PRF instance with a random Oracle

357
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,370
H of course this is possible due to the

358
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,980
PRF security and so from now on I'm

359
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,930
going to pretend that so here is an

360
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,400
illustration again for a three-block

361
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,650
case and from now on I'm going to

362
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,330
pretend that this is the definition of n

363
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,290
there okay so this post-processing

364
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,450
random Oracle is very helpful because it

365
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,940
prevents the extension attack but on the

366
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,130
other end this is not helpful because it

367
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,110
prevents using PRF security

368
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,080
the reason is this the adversary can

369
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,510
make different message block theories so

370
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,370
if the adversary makes zero block URI

371
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,890
then the Cascade will simply output the

372
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,080
secret key K and which will be post

373
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,170
processed by H and the adversary now has

374
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,500
access to H of K of course this is

375
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,959
problematic because what is peer of

376
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,420
security after all that's simply ability

377
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,790
to substitute one pair of instance with

378
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,189
the random function but in order to

379
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,619
guarantee that the cyclic case should be

380
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,849
well completely secret

381
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,349
and so now adversary knows H of K this

382
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,270
is an information leakage however small

383
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,970
this might be so what you need is that

384
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,339
this purif instance should remain

385
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,860
pseudo-random even when H K is leaked

386
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,090
when for a random RH so now we can

387
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,100
expect that because the amount of

388
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,160
information leakage is too small

389
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,170
intuitively it is almost clear that if F

390
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,380
is secure F should be again secure even

391
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,020
on the random leakage and in fact that

392
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,840
I'm going to say that and so anyway I

393
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,570
have a file

394
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,300
this notion formalized this notion

395
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,140
security and the random licorice as

396
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,020
follows so imagine two games in one game

397
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,510
the adversary is given correct instance

398
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,940
a random Oracle and a hash of the secret

399
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,460
key K and in another game we are

400
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,620
adversary's given a uniform random

401
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,020
function and a random Oracle and a fake

402
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,510
hash value and if true these two games

403
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,030
are indistinguishable then we say that

404
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,320
sheriff is secure on the random wreckage

405
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,300
and of course so classically it is not

406
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,990
that hard at all

407
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,420
to show that a secure PRF is secure on

408
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,150
the random negation and we were able to

409
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,860
do the same in the quantum setting and

410
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,040
the techniques we have used our

411
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,680
dominicanos innate hiding lemma and also

412
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,600
care of security against here recovery

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,990
ok so by invoking a 1-8 hiding lemma we

414
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,030
were able to pound any advantage of the

415
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,450
adversary attack on the under random

416
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,450
leakage by this right hand side term so

417
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,180
you can see that basically if the

418
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,270
function f is secure then the right hand

419
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,820
side is negligible well this is a very

420
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,980
weak bound but still as enough to prove

421
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,520
security on the random location well but

422
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,680
what about the I mentioned security

423
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,690
against key recovery but what about key

424
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,710
recovery isn't it obvious

425
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,770
so if he is recovered than all that's

426
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,920
all off but ultra positively if your

427
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,810
scheme is secure then it should be very

428
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,430
hard to recover the key

429
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,890
and of course in class car setting there

430
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,110
is a very easy proof and let's briefly

431
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,370
see how it works so if you have a key

432
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,620
recovery attacker then using a you can

433
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,440
build a distinguishing attacker P runs

434
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,660
this key recovery attacker until it

435
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,690
outputs a candidate key K and what be

436
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,720
next does is to very fair very check if

437
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,300
this answer is right or not by verifying

438
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,140
this key and an on period point Z so if

439
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,970
you see if this equation holds or not

440
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,790
and this P will output 1 if and only if

441
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,060
this verification checks out and in fact

442
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,830
this is fine in the classical case

443
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,760
because if this Oracle is a PRF instance

444
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,740
then B will output 1

445
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,990
with non-negligible probability as large

446
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,750
as the success probability of a and on

447
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,210
the other end this is a crucial part if

448
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,420
oh is a uniform random function this all

449
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,040
Z because Z sorry this all Z is uncured

450
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,440
so all this left hand side will be

451
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
independent from the right hand side and

452
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,700
this is really from random so therefore

453
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,520
the variation may check out only with a

454
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,590
negligible probability so that's how

455
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,530
classical proof goes but as you can see

456
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,600
in the quantum setting the problem is

457
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,030
that even one single theory may be

458
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,010
potentially plot all the points in the

459
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,010
superposition so in other words there

460
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,440
may not exist any point Z in the domain

461
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,720
where was he is independent from the

462
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,300
right hand side FK of Z so the classical

463
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,940
argument doesn't hold here so of course

464
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,980
the obvious way out is to instead of

465
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,200
verifying at an unclear at the point Z

466
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
we can verify a random point and

467
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,120
intuitively we can see that this should

468
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,490
obviously work but still analyzing this

469
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,679
may not be completely trivial and in

470
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,080
fact we were able to prove that if the

471
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,770
PRF is secure then it is secure against

472
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,460
key recovery by reusing to a variant of

473
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,530
quantum search problem so now we know

474
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,260
that PRF F is secure under under

475
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,679
medication and this can be looked in a

476
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,760
slightly different way equivalent way so

477
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,110
consider to function distributions in a

478
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,270
one function distribution key is chosen

479
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,690
and HK is concatenated by a PRF instance

480
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,150
so in this function the first part is

481
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,530
essentially random constant and in D 1

482
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,960
again a random w is chosen which is

483
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,490
concatenated by a uniform random

484
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,790
function so what PRF security on the

485
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,800
random linkage says is that these two

486
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,480
distributions are independent

487
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,530
indistinguishable if F is secure the

488
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,330
question is are they what are

489
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,410
indistinguishable

490
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,190
well almost but not so fast look at the

491
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,470
definition of D 0 this construction

492
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,840
depends on H and the auto bursary also

493
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,140
has access to H so therefore we need

494
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,669
actually one more update to the

495
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,429
of worker indistinguishability so in

496
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:22,110
fact that's possible and now we can say

497
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,029
that D zero and the owner or occur in

498
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:28,259
this usual relative to H and we can

499
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,720
essentially say the similar things so

500
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
now these two distributions are all in

501
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,129
distinguishable what do they mean so

502
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:38,940
given any index Zi and any index I we

503
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,200
can pick a random key couple of I so due

504
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,870
to this or occurring distinguishability

505
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,470
in short we can safely pretend that H of

506
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,039
a random function Kappa of I and F of

507
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,200
Kappa I and X are can be swapped with

508
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,179
the independent uniform random functions

509
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,509
of ini X respectively actually this

510
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,450
substitution is enough to prove quantum

511
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,059
securio mmm so I'm going to show you

512
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,169
briefly so I'm going to illustrate this

513
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:19,830
by the blocks up to three and again all

514
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,690
the games are identical except how the

515
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,940
Oracle is prepared of course in the

516
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,309
original Oracle B we have an net and

517
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,419
first thing we are going to do is to

518
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,240
substitute this random key syntactically

519
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,570
with a random function of a single tone

520
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,190
domain of course they are the same thing

521
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,980
it's only a syntactical change and now

522
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,850
that's done let's look at this so this

523
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,799
part is H of random function and F of

524
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,119
random from stains having the same

525
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,799
random function and the argument and so

526
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,139
on so from the Oracle security we can

527
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,970
see that we can substitute these two

528
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,230
parts independently to arrive at this

529
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,659
and of course we can do one more same

530
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,860
substitution so again this is H of a

531
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,590
random function and F of the same random

532
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,600
function and some odd room argument and

533
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,909
again we can substitute piece with two

534
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:20,450
independent random functions once more

535
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,850
and of course we can repeat this until

536
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,149
we get rid of all of PR F's and finally

537
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,950
we arrive at again where

538
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,170
the Oracle is uniform and non function

539
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,390
and essentially that proves the quantum

540
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,370
security your van back and so I have

541
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,880
shown you the proof that cascade

542
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,500
construction and n neck are quantum

543
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,050
secure and using some additional

544
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,470
assumption the the quantum secure of H

545
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,320
mag follows immediately and using

546
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,510
similar techniques we were able to also

547
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,420
prove quantum security of our guaranteed

548
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,810
cascade and a Mac thank you for your

549
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,690
attention

550
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,049
