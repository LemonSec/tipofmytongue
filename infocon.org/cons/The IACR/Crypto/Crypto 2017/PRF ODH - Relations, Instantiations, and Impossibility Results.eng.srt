1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,350
can you hear me all right yeah I think

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,360
it's on yeah

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm have to pleasure to talk to you

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,679
about Pierre for the age today that's a

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,480
relatively new assumption and we did a

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,580
systematic study of this assumption and

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,560
this is joint work with Mac officially

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,520
and Felix contain Christiansen so Pierre

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,279
48 is short for a pseudo-random function

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,769
or a codify Hellman and as was already

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,710
mentioned PRF odh is also a variant of

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,989
the oth assumption which was introduced

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,660
back in 2001 but the Lebel are in

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,210
Rockaway and PRF for the H appears

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,530
naturally in the context of

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,870
diffie-hellman based key exchanges as we

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,760
will see in a bit and it was first

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,949
introduced in 2012 here a crypto

19
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,650
actually in the TLS 1.2 security

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,680
analysis by Yaga tau and since then it

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,809
has been frequently used in different

22
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,879
analyses of key exchange protocols

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,110
let's they have read into it so what is

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,869
this PRF for the Aged so informally PRF

25
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,540
for the Aged guarantees that an

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,600
adversary cannot distinguish a PRF that

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,220
is kid with the diffie-hellman value

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,770
from random even if the adversary knows

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,690
the diffie-hellman shares that went into

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,080
the key as well as the PRF values under

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,750
related to how many keys so more

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,080
precisely the adversary's asked to

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,810
distinguish the PRF that is keyed with

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,500
some G to the UV from random even if it

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,700
knows G G tau T to the V and it learns

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,159
related PRF values under related to be

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,760
Hellman keys so and this learning of PRF

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,950
values is modeled by these or the H

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,620
Oracle so for example the adversary may

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,290
query do you Oracle on some top OS X

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,229
Prime and will then receive the PRF

42
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,200
Kate under ester day you and with label

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,810
X Prime and the OB Oracle works just the

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,780
same except for that the qidan is not as

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,570
to the U but as to the V so this models

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,129
the learning of the related PRF values

47
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,929
we did a first systematic study of this

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,269
assumption because because although it's

49
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,330
been used quite a bit there were some

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,650
open questions we will see the

51
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,659
actually there's been a bunch of pura

52
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,510
for the H values pyramid H assumptions

53
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,430
around and we establish the

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,640
relationships between those assumptions

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,569
then we asked ourselves the question

56
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,870
whether this PRA for the H actually

57
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,150
relates to some more well study to film

58
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,549
an assumption that we know of and we

59
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:37,900
answer this question by giving

60
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,659
instantiations of pura for the Aged and

61
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,819
now third result is in providing an

62
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,239
impossibility result and basically our

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,849
impossibility result says that PRF or

64
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,650
the H is most likely not the standard

65
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,750
model assumption and this is especially

66
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,659
interesting because initially PRF ODH

67
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,849
was introduced or was considered to be

68
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,680
standard model as there is no immediate

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,019
reference to a random Oracle in the

70
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,359
definition in Arab impossibility reserve

71
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,209
now states that this is most likely not

72
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,930
the case but before we come to our

73
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,189
contributions I would like to show you

74
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,739
how pura for the H comes up in the fee

75
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,609
homeland base key exchange so let's look

76
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,920
at the simplified execution of a DV

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,040
human-based key exchange we have our

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,310
server Bob here and Bob holds a say

79
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,609
static HDTV so GTA V is Bob's public key

80
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,280
and B is the corresponding secret key

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,260
and static means that it's a long-term

82
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,900
key so Bob will reuse this key whenever

83
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,659
he is talking to clients so for example

84
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,489
Alice could initiate the key exchange

85
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,489
with Bob and sent over her public key G

86
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,829
to the year will receive G to the V from

87
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,629
Bob and then they're both derive a

88
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,720
session key by first computing the

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,819
surety for Hellman values of G to the UV

90
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,060
and then paying a PRF with this on some

91
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,340
label X which may for example be the

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,319
transcript of the key exchange or

93
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,449
something like that okay and then they

94
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,159
have a session key which they can use to

95
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,540
encrypt communications but nothing

96
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,010
hinders our adversary from doing the

97
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,769
same right so our adversary Eve also

98
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,139
initiates a key exchange with Bob and

99
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,228
derives a K prime value which is Kate

100
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,889
with G to the W Lee now traditional key

101
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,340
exchange security asks from our

102
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,660
adversary to distinguish some session

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,050
they say this one from random however

104
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,990
we're in the setting where there are

105
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,960
related PRF values around related in the

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,180
sense that the key that goes into the

107
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,240
PRF has a comment if you Helmand share

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,180
with our so called tested session key so

109
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,320
this K over here as it turns out just

110
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,560
assuming DDH and the PRF security is not

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,530
enough in this setting but we find

112
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,540
ourselves in the setting of PRF for the

113
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,030
age our adversary is asked to

114
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,550
distinguish a PRF value that is kid with

115
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,040
a diffie-hellman value while knowing the

116
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,680
diffie-hellman shares that went into the

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
computation as well as related PRF

118
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,300
values so this is exactly pure footage

119
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,500
as we've seen it before now i already

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,210
indicated that there are different

121
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,190
variants of the PRF for the assumption

122
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,590
out there and this is due to the fact

123
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,660
that these key shares have kind of

124
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,910
lifespan so there may be a femoral that

125
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,370
means whenever a session is initiated

126
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,830
this value is generated freshly or there

127
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,750
may be semi static that's kind of a

128
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,510
medium left notion where these keys are

129
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,520
reused in a kind of smaller number of

130
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,340
sessions or their static or long-term

131
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,640
and used hands in a large number of

132
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,180
session and this lifespans then directly

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,800
determine how many related values to

134
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,550
adversary' can learn so let's look at

135
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,230
this in a bit more detail with our

136
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,020
example so we had our key exchange

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,660
between Alice and Bob and the resulting

138
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,340
session key supposed to be distinguished

139
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,340
by the adversary from random for the

140
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,260
sake of the argument right now let's

141
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,060
assume that both Alice and Bob have

142
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,630
static keys so they reuse these keys

143
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,590
whenever they're talking to other

144
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,840
parties so the situation is something

145
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,360
like this right so on the one side we

146
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,970
have the values where alice is talking

147
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,800
to someone and she always uses the G to

148
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,690
the year and on the other side we have

149
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,700
the situation where someone is talking

150
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,919
to Bob and Bob always uses the G to the

151
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,560
V so on both sides we have related PRF

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,840
values

153
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,120
so this is the situation that can come

154
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,780
up very easily and we model this when we

155
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,670
talk about the PRF or the Assumption we

156
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,800
model the situation by giving the

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,140
adversary access to these ODH Oracle's

158
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,960
so one for the yo-yo Oracle for the Chi

159
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,020
to do you case and the OB Oracle for the

160
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,110
G to the V case right so this models the

161
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,300
situation that the adversary can learn

162
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,760
these related keys okay so there are

163
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,370
different handshake modes in in key

164
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,980
exchange that means the combination of

165
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,620
Secrets is different across a key

166
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,810
exchanges for example they may combine

167
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,630
an ephemeral with a static key or they

168
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,840
might combine two ephemeral keys so we

169
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,550
have different variants that appear in

170
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,990
the literature depending on which

171
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,790
handshake mode day they analyzed and in

172
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,650
the literature they all just call them

173
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,130
pure for the age and we we thought okay

174
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,170
we kind of want to give a unified

175
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,660
definition to capture all these notions

176
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,800
and this notion we turned @lr PRF for

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,170
the age where the L indicates how many

178
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,440
queries can be made to the left Oracle

179
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,540
which will was in our case tou Oracle

180
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,360
and the R indicates how many queries can

181
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,520
be made to the right Oracle which was

182
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,570
the V Oracle and LNR may take up one of

183
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,140
three values so either n which means no

184
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,000
queries allowed so the adversary may

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,060
learn no related values s which means a

186
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,460
single query is allowed and M which

187
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,680
means multiple queries are allowed where

188
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
multiple is to be understood as

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,840
polynomial in the security parameter so

190
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,000
we have this unified notion of LR para

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,250
for the age and if one writes down all

192
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,860
the possible combinations of L and are

193
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,800
taking up either an S or M when ends up

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,010
with these nine different nations for

195
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,770
you navigation we color-coded them so

196
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,770
here these notions here in blue these

197
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,799
are the ones where the right Oracle is

198
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,990
set to N so there are no queries to the

199
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,300
right Oracle but queries to the left

200
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,870
Oracle

201
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,120
they're one-sided on this with this

202
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,460
citation and here in yellow we have the

203
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,610
ones where only D right Oracle maybe

204
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,640
query but not the left Oracle and if you

205
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,160
mix up blue and yellow you end up with

206
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,530
green and these notions are the ones

207
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,560
where both Oracle's are involved and up

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440
there you have an NP RF or the H in

209
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,290
orange which means no query to either

210
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,680
Oracle is allowed for the adversary in

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
the literature we've seen only as a part

212
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,820
of this so these four notions down here

213
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,940
for example the SNP RF for the H here

214
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,540
was used so single query to the left

215
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,420
Oracle no query to the right Oracle is

216
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,850
used when analyzing ephemeral

217
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,670
diffie-hellman handshakes both in TLS

218
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,550
1.2 and 1.3 it was used then if you go

219
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,850
down you have the mm PRF MN p RF or the

220
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,010
age this is 10 for static diffie-hellman

221
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,760
and also if you analyze we had some

222
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,720
element some analysis on low latency key

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,640
exchange merchant and you have this kind

224
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,280
of where both Oracle's are are in there

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,040
so let's let's look at some examples one

226
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,280
from each each level kind of and start

227
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,140
with SNP era for the age to really

228
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,320
really get a feel for the definition so

229
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,110
SNP area for the age singer query to do

230
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,520
you Oracle no query to do V Oracle in

231
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,470
our key exchanges situations like this

232
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,720
so we have the session which is supposed

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,630
to be distinguished and the adversary

234
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,230
learns a single related value then MN

235
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,140
PRI for th means the adversary makes

236
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,910
multiple related values which we

237
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,860
indicate by this arrow here so this cool

238
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,810
Oracle may then be queried multiple

239
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,140
times and if we go to mmm purification

240
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,240
actually this is the situation that

241
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,810
we've had before that we have static

242
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,390
case on both sides so the adversary may

243
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,050
learn multiple values from both Oracle's

244
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,220
right so we have all these different

245
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,630
notions

246
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,940
right here but what are their relations

247
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,519
like

248
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,249
and we started off with a trivial

249
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,720
implication so nothing really

250
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,300
interesting is here you simply establish

251
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,889
these by restricting the adversary's

252
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,069
capabilities in querying the Oracle so

253
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,779
for example if you want to get from mm

254
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,449
PRF for the age to SM PRF for the age

255
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,269
you simply restrict the adversary by not

256
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,670
allowing multiple queries to the left

257
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,040
Oracle but just a single one so nothing

258
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,529
really interesting is happening here but

259
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:26,759
the question is which of these

260
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,939
implications is strict so which of these

261
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,160
notions is strictly stronger than other

262
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,379
notions and for this we were giving

263
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,139
separations and some of the separations

264
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,290
we were able to achieve in the standard

265
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,149
model for some we had to rely on the

266
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,459
random Oracle model let's just have a

267
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,610
brief look these are the standard model

268
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,980
separations that we were able to achieve

269
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,309
so they're kind of up in the in the

270
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,879
upper part of the of the picture and

271
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,949
these are the two separations where we

272
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,170
had to rely on the random Oracle model

273
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,110
and although for some of you it might

274
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,209
have been late yesterday but I'm sure

275
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,129
you spot like I can't hide from you that

276
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,929
this picture doesn't look complete and

277
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,980
it isn't because actually for these two

278
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,999
no implications here we were not able to

279
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,449
give separations and now you might

280
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,459
wonder how's that looks pretty

281
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,369
symmetrical or all over this was because

282
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,949
I was hiding something in the definition

283
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,809
of PRF for the age so we didn't discuss

284
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,850
in detail what it looks like and

285
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,009
actually there's an asymmetry in the

286
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,589
definition of pure for the age so one of

287
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,990
the Oracle's the left Oracle is given to

288
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,209
the adversary at the outset of the game

289
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,189
while the other one is only received

290
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:50,189
with the challenge and this asymmetry we

291
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,259
also have here in our separations and we

292
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,649
were not able it in this case to achieve

293
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,279
the separation also because a PRF is

294
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,220
kind of a memoryless thing so we would

295
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,470
have somehow to find a way to encode

296
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,410
information in the PRF that one Oracle

297
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,819
could exploit but the other one could

298
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,760
not so all other implications are strict

299
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,290
except for these two where we don't know

300
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,390
yet well the district all right so let's

301
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,560
get to the enunciations PRF ODH seems

302
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,070
like a strange thing but somehow it's a

303
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,840
difficult assumption and we wondered

304
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,240
like how can we instantiate Pierre for

305
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,000
the age from more well-known assumptions

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,800
that we know and actually in the case of

307
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,710
n n PRF or the age so up here where you

308
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,350
have no query to either Oracle we were

309
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,150
able to instantiate that one in the

310
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,020
standard model under D th and just usual

311
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,980
PRF security in the group G on the other

312
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,070
end of the spectrum we were able to

313
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,560
instantiate it with a strong defi

314
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,480
Hellman in the programmable random

315
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,030
Oracle model what do I mean by

316
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,910
instantiate just make it clear so if you

317
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,800
take a functions for example for the NM

318
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,670
PR for the H case that is PRF secure and

319
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,010
the deh assumption also holds in that

320
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,960
group then we showed that the F is also

321
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,710
an NP F for the H secure and this is

322
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,460
similarly for the mm PR for the H

323
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,610
instantiation this kind of brings us

324
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,740
naturally to our impossibility result

325
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,480
which is the last result I want to talk

326
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,930
to you about today we see that up here

327
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,180
we have a standard model instantiation

328
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,250
while down here we in the programmable

329
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,980
random Oracle model and our

330
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,590
impossibility result now shows that as

331
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,690
soon as you give the adversary just a

332
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,820
single access to one of the Oracles

333
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,650
you will no longer have a standard model

334
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,370
algebraic blackbox reduction so as soon

335
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,050
as we go from an NP F or the h2s N or n

336
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,540
SPF or the age we no longer have

337
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,520
standard model as a bright black box

338
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
reductions more precisely said the

339
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,400
theorem states that if we assume

340
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,720
decisional squared if a home and problem

341
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,800
to be hard which means to distinguish G

342
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,870
to the a squared from G to the B for

343
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,270
random a be given G to the a we

344
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,160
assume this to be hot then we showed

345
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,280
that there exists no efficient algebra

346
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,740
black box reduction from the weakest

347
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,680
one-sided PRF for the H assumption to a

348
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,590
deal eh augmented problem there's some

349
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,230
something to explain here to algebraic

350
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,320
reductions most reductions that we know

351
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,570
algebraic that just means that the

352
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,550
reduction knows the representation of

353
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,830
group elements and it makes use of them

354
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,250
and th augmented problems are a very

355
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,560
wide and general class of cryptographic

356
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,200
problems where the diversity is either

357
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,300
asked to to solve DDH or some abstract

358
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,770
and independent hard cryptographic

359
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,590
problem and the adversary can decide on

360
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,410
the fly where they wants to solve D th

361
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,390
or this instance of a general

362
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,910
cryptographic problem that it was

363
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,780
hindered this impossibility so maybe

364
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,940
you've noticed I've always said like PRF

365
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,070
odh is likely not a standard model

366
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,750
assumption this is because we have

367
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,270
restrictions in our impossibility result

368
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,390
the first restriction is which may allow

369
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,940
to bypass the result that the decision

370
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,830
of square diffie-hellman problem is hard

371
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,800
we know that the computational square

372
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,660
diffie-hellman problem is equivalent to

373
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,420
see the H but it is not clear whether

374
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,600
the decision of version follows from D D

375
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,450
H so this is one restriction and the

376
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,820
other one is on the black box reduction

377
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,580
to be algebraic so the impossibility

378
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,150
result may be bypassed but this is a

379
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,020
first challenging to do and with that

380
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,760
I'd like to summarize what we've learnt

381
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,340
today so I hope you've seen that pure

382
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,010
for the H appears naturally in the film

383
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,770
and base key exchange and we did a

384
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,810
systematic study of this assumption

385
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,140
where we gave a unified definition and

386
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,170
then establish the relations between the

387
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,459
different variants and we gave

388
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,260
instantiations of PRF or th our

389
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,700
impossibility result and gave a strong

390
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,550
indication that PRF for the H is not a

391
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,070
standard model assumption somewhat

392
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,810
contradicting what we've been thinking

393
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,720
before

394
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,880
however for everyone who's working on

395
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,309
key exchange security I believe or we

396
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,559
believe PRF ODH to be very useful

397
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,410
because it gets you to simpler more

398
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,580
modular proofs usually you have a rather

399
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,920
complex reduction to captivity Helmand

400
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,660
or stronger few Hellman in the

401
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,240
programmable random Oracle model but by

402
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,100
using PRF for th this is just a

403
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,960
straightforward reduction that makes it

404
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,179
proved much more easier and with that

405
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,309
I'd like to conclude and I'm very happy

406
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,230
to take any questions you might have

407
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,110
thank you

408
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,659
