1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,940
yeah I'm going to talk about column

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,230
non-availability and authentication and

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,460
yeah this is joint work with Cora

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,230
analogous and I want to start with a

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,880
with a classical motivation to to get an

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,480
intuition

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,140
what what what these security notions

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,910
want to do so we have this guy up here

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,560
[Music]

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,180
and he was buy a new notebook so what

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,860
does he do he sends a message to his

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,800
bank to transfer some money set into the

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,460
notebook store but if this message is

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,260
intercepted and some malicious adversary

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,540
changes the contents of the message then

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,430
of course he will be very unhappy

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,390
because he loses all this money so what

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,670
what kind of cryptography could could

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,950
prevent this one answer is non malleable

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,270
encryption so in this case I want to

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,600
give you a specific intuition about

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,180
malleable encryption that we will use

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,490
that later to define the quantum notion

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,300
so now this guy encrypts the message

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,149
instead of sending it in plain and now

26
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,850
no non non malleability will ensure that

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,810
if this malicious adversary changes the

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,869
message any such change will result in a

29
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,869
random change at best of the message and

30
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,310
of course the the bank will basically be

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,660
confused and not transfer anything so

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,950
with this in mind I want to start

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,130
presenting our results and I want to

34
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,020
start out with giving a summary of our

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,429
results so that you know what to expect

36
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:46,649
so we give a new definition of

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,630
information theoretic normal ability for

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,319
quantum symmetric key encryption and

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,729
this definition fixes the vulnerability

40
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,039
then that was allowed by the previous

41
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,330
definition also it implies secrecy just

42
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,940
like quantum authentication implies the

43
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,660
secrecy it can also be used as a

44
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,580
primitive like any non malleable scheme

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,379
according to this definition can be used

46
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,650
as a primitive permits

47
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,129
for building of Education schemes and

48
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:25,939
finally it has two equivalent to

49
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,310
equivalent characterizations that one of

50
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,099
them is based on entropies and one of

51
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,890
them is a simulation based

52
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,299
characterization and these make it easy

53
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,670
to see that this definition both

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,980
generalizes a classical definition and

55
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,579
it improves the pre-existing quantum

56
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,730
definition in addition we have another

57
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,500
result on authentication we saw that the

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,470
recent definition for authentication

59
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,870
with key recycling that will be the

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,909
topic one of the topics of the next talk

61
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,650
can be fulfilled with unitary two

62
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,189
designs okay

63
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,359
let's start about non non malleability

64
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,870
so classically non malleability was

65
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,549
first defined in the context of public

66
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,500
key cryptography and it was defined in

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,400
terms of a simulation based security

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,349
using relations on the plaintext so

69
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,780
basically it was define defined in a way

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,109
such that for any adversary that tries

71
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,599
to produce a related plaintext by

72
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,230
modifying the ciphertext there exists a

73
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,269
simulator that doesn't even use the

74
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,940
ciphertext

75
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,250
later it was realized that one can

76
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,760
characterize non malleability in as a

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,190
certain kind of chosen plaintext it's a

78
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,340
chosen ciphertext security and this

79
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,620
intuition was used by Hana okay Tao to

80
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,370
to come up with information theoretic

81
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,319
definition of non malleability in the

82
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,370
symmetric key setting so this this works

83
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,760
as follows if we have two plaintext

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,789
ciphertext pairs X C and X to the sixth

85
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,760
C children where the two cipher texts

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,130
are different then basically even

87
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,320
knowing one plaintext ciphertext pair

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,289
doesn't tell me anything about the

89
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,160
plaintext corresponding to a given

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,610
different ciphertext okay so yeah later

91
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,300
there was also another definite

92
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,290
definition given for information

93
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,390
theoretic non liability that more in the

94
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,520
spirit of simulation based security okay

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,810
so to to illustrate what what are the

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,470
challenges in making a quantum security

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,540
definition of this kind I want to

98
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,520
describe to you what what problems can

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,430
arise so this is the set up for

100
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,280
classical non malleability so we have

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,560
some plain text text here that's

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,230
encrypted into a ciphertext C then the

103
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,630
adversary apply some attack that

104
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,850
modifies the possibly multiplies the

105
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,270
ciphertext and then it is decrypted so

106
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,980
how do we check whether such a scheme

107
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,020
here is secure we make copies of the of

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,850
the plaintext and the two ciphertext

109
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,310
here and now we can for example evaluate

110
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,480
a relation on the plaintext and the on

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,840
the to plaintext here or we can

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,720
calculate the conditional mutual

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,090
information that is used in the

114
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,600
definition of Hana whakatau but none of

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,030
this is possible in the quantum case

116
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,500
because because of the no-cloning

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,990
theorem that tells us that if X is a

118
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,990
quantum message here then we cannot make

119
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,120
a copy of it and if C is a quantum

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,919
cipher text we cannot make a copy of it

121
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,450
so one has to come up with whether ya

122
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,750
with different ideas how to how to fix

123
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,830
this okay so let's see what what a

124
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,980
quantum symmetric key encryption

125
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,220
encryption scheme is so we have a

126
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,690
quantum symmetric key encryption scheme

127
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,520
is given by a family of encryption and

128
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,800
decryption Maps indexed by a classical

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,169
key we assume the classical key to be

130
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,419
uniformly random so chosen from some

131
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,070
some set and these maps yeah the person

132
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,900
that goes from a plaintext base a to a

133
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
ciphertext airs base E and the

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,979
is just a quantum Channel so that's

135
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,710
that's the the quantum version of a

136
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,479
stochastic map basically also we allow

137
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,159
the decryption map to reject that's why

138
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,740
the decryption map goes to like this two

139
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,180
slightly enlarged plaintext space that

140
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,030
includes this reject symbol okay and for

141
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,530
for the rest of the talk to use in the

142
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,710
in the rest of the talk I sorry I just

143
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,650
wanted to state that correctness says of

144
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,330
course if we compose these two maps we

145
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,110
get the identity map and yeah for the

146
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,580
for the rest of the talk we make this

147
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,099
definition quantum mechanics is linear

148
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,530
so these this encryption and decryption

149
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,050
maps are linear maps so we just take the

150
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,280
expectation over all the keys of the

151
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,069
encryption map and this is a this is a

152
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,550
valid quantum Channel again we make a

153
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,979
similar definition for for the for the

154
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,940
decryption map okay now let's go back to

155
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,219
the set up so this is this is the set up

156
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,610
that I showed you for for classical for

157
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,680
the classical non malleability we have

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,870
Ellis that wants to send a message and

159
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,479
Bob one that is the receiver of the

160
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,009
message and then in the middle sits

161
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,409
Mallory the active adverse adversity

162
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:05,069
survey that once so wants to make

163
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,169
implement a certain change on on the

164
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,800
plaintext now in the quantum case we

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,409
have to add a reference register here

166
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,680
and that is because basically because of

167
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,629
the no-cloning theorem we have to

168
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,750
replace this whole copying procedure by

169
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,319
some by something and we replace it by

170
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,389
adding a register here which basically

171
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,330
contains all the information that all

172
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,640
other objects say that a contains

173
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,219
information about that that the message

174
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,899
contains information about then also we

175
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,719
we will basically make a definition in

176
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,420
the spirit of semantic security so we

177
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,970
allow Mallory to process some initial

178
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,430
site information about the

179
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,320
about the message and this is this

180
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:01,260
register be here okay so now for to

181
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,050
formalize non-metal ability we make we

182
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,330
define the effective map now so the

183
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,450
effective map is just the composition of

184
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,240
encryption the attack map and the

185
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,970
decryption so basically the whole the

186
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,230
whole protocol here and then taking the

187
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,990
we take the expectation over the key so

188
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,080
this is basically the map that Mallory

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,470
expects to apply to the plaintext space

190
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,620
enter site information register okay so

191
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,530
now I think we're ready to to have a

192
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,900
look at a new definition so the idea is

193
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,140
to define non malleability such that

194
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,450
Mallory cannot increase her correlations

195
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,790
with the honest parties so remember that

196
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,280
in the beginning I give you this

197
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,710
intuition that non malleability means

198
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,350
that any change on the ciphertext space

199
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,190
means will at best implement a random

200
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,570
change on the plaintext

201
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,960
so such such an interference cannot be

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,470
used to build up correlations between

203
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,350
Mallory and anti honest parties but

204
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,090
there's of course one thing that Mallory

205
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,030
always can do and that she can either

206
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,790
let the message through or she can

207
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,870
destroy it basically and she can also do

208
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,700
this probabilistically for example she

209
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,770
can flip the coin record the outcome and

210
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,220
then depending on the out on the on the

211
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,930
outcome either discard the plaintext or

212
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,090
letter too so this gives her an

213
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,040
opportunity to slightly increase her

214
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,770
correlations with the honest parties so

215
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,810
our goal is to define non malleability

216
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,390
such that only this unavoidable attack

217
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,150
is possible basically and that's what we

218
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,850
we did so let's have a look at this

219
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,240
definition so down here we have the we

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,000
have the set up again so now I'm drew

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,920
this dashed line so we start out with

222
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,770
some quantum state row on these three

223
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,200
register and we have some final quantum

224
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,430
state

225
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,279
Sigma so what we would like to say is

226
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,430
that the quantum mutual information

227
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,779
between Malory site information here and

228
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,390
the honest parties does not increase

229
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,899
under the protocol but we already saw

230
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,700
that this is impossible so we have to

231
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,430
add a small term to this which is

232
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,279
basically it's a binary entropy entropy

233
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,260
term and it accounts for this

234
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,010
unavoidable attack here so this is a

235
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,980
binary entropy term of some probability

236
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,860
the probability is given down here but

237
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,630
the actual definition is not so

238
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,550
important let me just say what it means

239
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,990
it's just a way to yeah it's basically

240
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,580
intuitively it's the probability that

241
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,250
this attack my blunder acts as the

242
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,410
identity on the ciphertext space here

243
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,279
when the int input on the on the side

244
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:04,370
information is roll okay so this is this

245
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,950
is nice intent and in it it's an

246
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,709
entropic characterization and if you sit

247
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,240
down with a piece of paper and then you

248
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,730
can like quickly write down a particular

249
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,990
choice of site information register

250
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,120
reference register and attack map such

251
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,640
as to recover the definition of Hana

252
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,800
okay Tao in in the classical case but

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
then also we can give a definition

254
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,300
that's more that gives more practical

255
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,760
security guarantee like an equivalent

256
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,220
characterization of our definition so

257
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,640
and this looks like as follows so we can

258
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,150
prove that a scheme is non quantum non

259
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,640
malleable if and only if the effective

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,870
map resulting from such a scheme for a

261
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,270
map for an attack map lambda has this

262
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,200
form here so this is a combination of

263
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,459
the identity and a replacement map and

264
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,440
this replacement map it just disguised

265
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,010
the plaintext and replaces it by the

266
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,410
decryption of a random ciphertext with a

267
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,529
random key and these are of course

268
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,510
paired up with some maps on the side

269
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,390
information that

270
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,850
that that Mallory always can implement

271
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,880
okay so this is a good point to to

272
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,460
compare this this definition with the

273
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,500
previously existing definition this was

274
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,040
given by a - bouta and winter in in 2009

275
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,390
and let's first look at the setup so

276
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,150
they they include a reference register

277
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,060
here this is base yeah because this this

278
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,770
is what one it definitely needs to do in

279
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,760
the quantum case but they don't allow

280
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,620
initial site information for for the

281
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,050
adversary and what is maybe even more

282
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,800
important they is another difference so

283
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,840
their definition is also enter in the

284
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,060
simulation paradigm so they they just

285
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,890
say that the effective map will always

286
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,200
look look like this it's a bit similar

287
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,060
as our definition but instead of having

288
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,190
this very particular replacement map

289
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,270
where the input is replaced by the

290
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,640
random decryption a random ciphertext

291
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,460
decrypted with a random P they replace

292
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,550
it by yeah they all replacement maps

293
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,670
that are random decryptions decryptions

294
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,020
with the random key are allowed so

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,060
basically the adversary can pick a

296
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,890
ciphertext and then have it decrypted

297
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,540
with a random key this doesn't look so

298
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,780
bad but actually there is a separation

299
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,230
between these two definitions so we have

300
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,540
a scheme the separation scheme that

301
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,780
shows that basically that is secure

302
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,060
according to this ABW non malleability

303
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,780
and this insecure according to our

304
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,820
definition and it allows the adversary

305
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,310
to basically choose the output of the

306
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,370
decryption function so basically yeah

307
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,800
the adversary can't send any message so

308
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,330
to Bob this doesn't seem so bad if you

309
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,390
think of the public key setting because

310
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,550
there this is always possible but then

311
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,530
the private key setting this is somehow

312
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,380
unnecessary as so one can give a

313
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,450
definition that prevents it and that's

314
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,139
that's what we

315
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,790
what we did okay

316
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,429
so let me give some more properties of

317
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:40,899
the definition so in the case where the

318
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,019
encryption map for any given K is

319
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,859
unitary we can prove that our definition

320
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,619
of non malleability is equivalent to the

321
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:53,199
fact that the set of encryption maps the

322
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,449
encryption unitary is a unitary to

323
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:00,579
design and this is also equivalent owned

324
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,769
by a binds that out that that this is

325
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,589
equivalent to their to their definition

326
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,019
as well so in the case of unitary

327
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,189
encryption maths the two definitions of

328
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:14,669
quantum non malleability are equivalent

329
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,369
however they are interesting settings

330
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:21,069
where nonunitary encryption schemes are

331
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:25,119
important and that for example for

332
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,160
authentication if one wants an

333
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,739
authenticating scheme then this can

334
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,049
never be unitary it needs to have a

335
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,959
cipher text space that's larger than the

336
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:42,089
plaintext space okay so one more

337
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,139
property that I already mentioned is

338
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,699
that this definition of quantum non

339
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,769
liability it implies information

340
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:49,419
theoretic indistinguishability

341
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,689
this is somehow contrary to the

342
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:54,999
classical setting where non malleability

343
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,059
and indistinguishability are completely

344
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,860
independent properties but it's

345
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,439
analogous to the setting of quantum

346
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,169
authentication where this has already

347
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,789
shown a long time ago and also what i

348
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,069
what i want to talk about in the in the

349
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,269
last part of the talk is the fact that

350
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:20,859
one can build authentication schemes

351
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:23,589
from any scheme that is not malleable

352
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:29,100
according to the new definition okay

353
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,440
this is just a visual summary of what I

354
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,130
told you so far basically and let us

355
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,769
move on to authentication now so just a

356
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,049
reminder what

357
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,259
education means so if I if the sky the

358
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,700
notebook ordering guy and Chris

359
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,470
encrypted messages with an

360
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,710
authenticating scheme then any change

361
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,580
any change by the adversary will be

362
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,529
detected so basically if the adversary

363
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,809
change the message then the decryption

364
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:03,539
function will output reject message or

365
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,409
an error message in the quantum setting

366
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,869
our authentication has been first

367
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:14,879
studied in 2002 by Barney model the most

368
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,100
most use definition was given by the

369
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,889
Queen Nielsen SFI but last year there

370
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:26,669
was given a new definition by Gaea q1

371
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,609
and jandry which will be featured in the

372
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,399
next talk and this definition is

373
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,039
stronger it provides security guarantees

374
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,399
with high probability over the key and

375
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,889
allows for key recycling and this

376
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,529
definition looks like this

377
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,350
it looks a bit frightening so I will not

378
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,850
explain it explain it in detail now but

379
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,269
basically the the spirit of it is that

380
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:58,049
it gives yeah it it is it secures that

381
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,259
the expected distance between the

382
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:06,109
similar simulator and and the actual

383
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,850
protocol is small so it gives a

384
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,049
guarantee that that that the security

385
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,369
property holds with high probability

386
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:21,600
over the key okay so in the in in the

387
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,419
original paper this definition was shown

388
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,549
to be achievable using unitary eight

389
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:33,119
designs and what we did is we took the

390
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,649
scheme and replaced the eight designed

391
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,960
by a two design and using a different

392
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,629
analysis we could show that it is also

393
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:42,499
secure if for the case of two designs

394
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:46,619
and this respect what was independently

395
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,169
proven by apartment and the advantages

396
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:52,350
of course their two designs require much

397
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,529
shorter keys and there are very nice

398
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,580
constructions like

399
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,830
for example the Clifford group or

400
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,200
they're they're also derived

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,840
constructions from the from the Clifford

402
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,190
group okay it seems like I have time to

403
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,380
quickly give you an idea about the proof

404
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,210
of this fact so the first observation is

405
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:20,669
that one can basically as basically as

406
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,679
in the classical case randomize

407
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,690
strategies that don't help so basically

408
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,480
one can restrict to pure quantum states

409
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,690
as initial States and I saw mitrice as

410
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,299
attack maps and so if we have an attack

411
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,190
isometry this is just a matrix basically

412
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,620
from on these spaces then then then we

413
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,679
define a simulator here by just taking

414
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,779
the the trace over the C space so we

415
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,730
have a tensor product space but we only

416
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,880
take the trace over the first factor and

417
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,130
this simulator was the same simulator

418
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,740
was used in the tree in the in the

419
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,570
original paper and it was first

420
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,279
introduced by broadband and Wainwright

421
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,840
also in 2016 so basically what we want

422
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,789
to do is we want to bound the difference

423
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,309
between what actually happens and the

424
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,669
simulator and this is in the two norm

425
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:21,990
here so so the strategy now is because

426
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,909
this is a to design this comes from a

427
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,950
tool design here we can replace this

428
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,899
expression by an integration over the

429
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:31,799
higher measure and use sure's lemma for

430
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,380
the representation of the unitary group

431
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,519
given by the double tensor product to

432
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,269
two about this difference here okay so

433
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,580
let me so the last part is about how to

434
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,010
build authentication from a non

435
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,370
malleable scheme so basically now

436
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,570
instead of just sending the plain

437
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,210
message this guy here thinks he's smart

438
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,639
and says okay I will tell the bank in

439
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,860
advance I will attach like a string of

440
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,380
zeros in the end of my message and now

441
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,860
encrypt this with a non malleable scheme

442
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,690
now if an adversary changes this

443
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,750
we know that this will result at best in

444
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,530
a random change of the message so random

445
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,380
trade will with high probability changed

446
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,510
this last line here from not from from

447
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,190
being or zero string to something else

448
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,140
so the only thing the decryption

449
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,390
function has to do is check is the

450
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,660
stores or zero string and if no it will

451
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,620
just reject so this is how basically

452
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,180
this this kind this notion of non mail

453
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,340
bility can be used to produce an

454
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,810
authenticating scheme and the last

455
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,660
result is that I want to present is that

456
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,060
exactly this works in the quantum case

457
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,830
so basically if we define a new scheme

458
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,460
by taking by taking a smaller message

459
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,140
space embedding it in the bigger message

460
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,960
space so basically taking a message and

461
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,130
appending like a constant tactical game

462
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,400
and then the decryption function is

463
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,040
defined exactly as shown in the last

464
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,610
picture just decrypt the non malleable

465
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,440
scheme and then check whether the tag is

466
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,530
intact then this provides quantum

467
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,870
authentication according to the

468
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,820
definition by Dupree Mills necessarily

469
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,230
okay so this was the last slide

470
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,230
basically here is a quick summary of our

471
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,230
results about authentication we showed

472
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,440
that this standard notion of

473
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,940
authentication can be obtained from

474
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,750
former quantum non-meta scheme and the

475
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,120
stronger notion can be obtained with

476
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,690
through designs so I want to finish with

477
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,800
a few open questions so of course now

478
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,900
the question is what about computational

479
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,150
security and and chosen chosen plaintext

480
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,670
chosen ciphertext security and so on so

481
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,340
there are there's some ongoing work with

482
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,140
with Cori and other key to my co-author

483
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,370
on this paper and tomasa value only also

484
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,530
the question is can we give some

485
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,600
security gaylord guarantee with high

486
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,250
probability foreign

487
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,890
non malleability because right now we

488
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,380
always talk about the average over the

489
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,980
key so this is somehow it would be

490
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,039
better if we could give a guarantee with

491
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,890
high probability and then also like some

492
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,230
minor point is I would like to beautify

493
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,440
the dependency on the under attack map

494
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,440
because this this this quantity P equal

495
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,270
is like kind of tower counterintuitive

496
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,370
so it would be good if we could remove

497
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,789
it okay so with this this is the end of

498
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,560
my talk thank you for listening

499
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,099
[Applause]
