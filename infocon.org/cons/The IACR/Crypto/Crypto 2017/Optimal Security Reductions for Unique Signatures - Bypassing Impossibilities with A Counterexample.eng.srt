1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,900
and this talk was shown with my student

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,150
no more chain and gentle night and also

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,880
my colleges with Susilo come in younger

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,640
EMU we are from University of Wollongong

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,460
Australia but now ii also is now working

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,500
in national university event economic

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,140
china

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,060
let me quickly revisit the signature

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,910
definition and its secure modeled

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,320
Accenture scheme is composed of four a

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,930
koreans in our definition certain

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,629
parameter generation key generation

13
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,239
signing verification arrogance in squawk

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,239
we use capital we use the capital C

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,530
comma M to denote as nature of message m

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,239
in the the standard school model for

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,770
digital signature is known as edges

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,750
venture and photo mobility against

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,239
chosen message attack in this view model

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,550
the edible circle so the challenge of

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,590
first generation parameters and

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,050
propagated to the adversary learn the

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,070
adversary can data rate chose message

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,619
for layer signature Curie's at the end

25
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,619
the adversary wins the game if it can

26
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:15,910
output a new very signatures on a new

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,539
message denoted by M start in the

28
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,270
corresponding security duction we are

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,069
going to solve a computational problem

30
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,490
so the simulator first are used of Roman

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,229
instance to simulate the system

32
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,929
parameter property and or curat

33
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,020
signatures to the attache and we are

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,380
used the fortunate to solve

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,330
computational harperman

36
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,910
in the perfect our central simulations

37
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,849
or signatures in a simulation can be

38
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:50,319
classified into two sets

39
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,530
Simonetta and reducible and a cincher is

40
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,099
similar table if it can be computed by

41
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:59,349
lace immunity because it's computable

42
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,840
such a signature cannot be reduced to

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,360
solving a problem and the second type is

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,179
our reducible a signature is reducible

45
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,050
if the cylinder can use it to solve a

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,170
problem because it's reducible such a

47
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,680
signature cannot be computed by us

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,340
because if it can be computed by the

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,370
simulator bins the simulator can solve

50
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,640
the problem without the help of the

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,819
anniversary so in a success secure

52
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,700
adduction 42 inches it requires that all

53
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,909
curious signatures must be simulated and

54
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,760
the forged signatures must be reducible

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,000
this is the essential conditions for a

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,739
successful security action in a security

57
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,180
duction we use an atrocious attack on a

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,629
proposed scheme to solve computers

59
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,879
harperman and that we have a high cost

60
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,120
Dino by capital T and screed loss or

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,349
loss fetter

62
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,680
denoted by a lot and we caught with a

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,819
deduction its many associate with the

64
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,489
loss better the deduction is tight if

65
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,540
error is small or constant and

66
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,129
deductions lose if error is linear in

67
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,109
the number of Curie such as the high

68
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,989
security or national security and those

69
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,569
reduction is not good enough because we

70
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,060
have to compensate we have to increase

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,340
the length of the security parameter to

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,129
compensate the security lost so an

73
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,989
inheritance how to achieve title

74
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,120
reduction for digital ninjas in the

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,970
literature we use a random shot art

76
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,459
denoted R here in the signature

77
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,709
generation suppose on the space of the

78
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,549
random number is art we try to program

79
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,340
the simulation in the weight led for

80
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,829
each message ok for each message the

81
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,590
Brendan space R can be split into two

82
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,169
sets we call it a sim unit over space

83
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,560
and reducible space and a signature on

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,949
message m using our is simulate able if

85
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,048
R is children from the simulated space

86
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,409
or it will be reducible if it's

87
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:26,539
something from the reducible space so to

88
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,580
achieve total reduction for all Curie

89
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,629
you need

90
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,960
made it by the atashi the Ximena try to

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,289
pick ah from Lhasa mean it was space

92
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,800
such a less not abortion during ginger

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,620
curry so we have the Sakura duction is

94
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,340
are successful if the signature is

95
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,610
reducible in this case and we have the

96
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,159
probability of successful with us it is

97
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,520
depend on the sides of such a reducible

98
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,270
space and for example the reduction is

99
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,599
tied with Loss Factor - when the two

100
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,210
sides the G double space and the minute

101
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,690
of space are the same and the condition

102
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,659
of this kinds of approach for title

103
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:17,840
return or must use or random thoughts in

104
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,270
the signature generations this is the

105
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,349
condition however none orange scheme

106
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,690
allowed to use a random salt for example

107
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,050
unique changes in exchange is a very

108
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,690
special digital signature scheme roughly

109
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,870
speaking if Sigma m and Sigma M prime

110
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,650
are both very changes of M then they

111
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,770
must be identical in uniqueness

112
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,279
definition so in the corresponding

113
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,969
signature generation we can now use a

114
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,250
random shot in this kind of signature

115
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,319
generation because returned and sought

116
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,490
we produce a distinct signature

117
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,340
therefore the approach using a oriented

118
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,979
salt for the signature generation sorry

119
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,990
using a general sought for title

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,370
relation is not suitable for unique

121
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,289
signatures it means that we cannot use

122
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,960
such an approach to achieve data

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,210
reduction for a unique signature scheme

124
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,279
and suppose these kinds of teller

125
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,379
reductions for unique changes are

126
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,539
churches that we are looking for and

127
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,900
this highway is the current currently

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,629
non secure attraction we can program so

129
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,580
the church is at the end of its highway

130
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,520
and the Christians can wage that and

131
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,109
find the chariot

132
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,910
so in the past 15 years

133
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,790
there are street signs place in his

134
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,350
house so in that it's impossible to

135
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,110
reach layout and corresponding result

136
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,170
will publish in your crypteron - Pikachu

137
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,360
- run trough and your crypt last yet all

138
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,260
these three works so sled initiative

139
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,040
deduction for a unique signature or its

140
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,720
generation call an efficiently

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,790
read generalizable senior scheme must

142
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,590
have lost fat arrow and arrow are not

143
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,050
the same in Sri works but the lower

144
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,080
bound is Q s Q s here is the llama of

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,840
signature curious made by the head of a

146
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,740
shape this is the lone result in

147
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,810
previous three works however we found we

148
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,740
can just get read by we can bypass okay

149
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,170
just bypass this stop sign and reach the

150
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,080
truth by a very tricky part with the

151
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,820
help of hawk

152
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,140
so with Grandpa here grow hope is a new

153
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,400
security dozen for 42 signatures we

154
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,830
could cure abyss reduction in the

155
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,320
security - and 40 changes I mean in the

156
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,970
traditional in the traditional security

157
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,070
osmond for digital signatures if the

158
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,890
simulator use of forged signature to

159
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,240
solve our user for signature made by

160
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,610
computer from the atashi to shop and

161
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,000
iron

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,220
harperman we call this is 40 page

163
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,190
reduction why in Curie based reduction

164
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,400
the simulator we use how secure is made

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,730
by the adversary to solve an antenna hop

166
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,700
over the only difference is way of

167
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,660
solving an underlying harperman so the

168
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,190
first one is the first page reduction

169
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,260
and here is curry paste reduction

170
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,599
actually cure paste curry paste it

171
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,450
actually is not a complete new secure

172
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,360
adduction because we have already used

173
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,400
it to prove security for encryption

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,340
scheme in the indistinguishable security

175
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,010
model and computational happiness

176
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,790
assumption but death

177
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,340
in fact any work about used in these

178
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,110
kinds of curry paste reduction for

179
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,550
digital images let me give you a simple

180
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,320
example to explain this kinds of

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,570
accurate based production suppose the

182
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,690
system parameter is the parent group

183
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,610
parent group including a critical V hash

184
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,980
function whose output space is the

185
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,620
parent group G and the publication C to

186
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,610
alpha and the squeakiest alpha a

187
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,600
signature here a signature of a message

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,460
actually is composed to be RS seizures

189
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,490
now first PR signature on message m and

190
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,330
the second PR singes the signature on m

191
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,900
concatenate love first PR s nature okay

192
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,980
this is the construct the construction

193
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,210
jet suppose in the security action if

194
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,120
alpha is a and hn in a mean in the

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,660
random Oracle model and the has um is

196
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,870
responding using G to P then we have the

197
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,280
first the first engine is G to a B so if

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,640
the adversary's want to forge the

199
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,670
signature own message m the anniversary

200
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,550
must make the Hajj occurs on M and M

201
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,740
concatenate the first singer to live in

202
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,080
a rocker to complete the signature

203
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,170
forging otherwise is in otherwise the

204
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,080
allowable can not had a land advantage

205
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,390
to forge the fault

206
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,350
ginger so we have that shows and G to a

207
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,170
be we appear in her she curates because

208
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,810
this one we have made it by the other

209
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,970
version actually our our ginger scheme

210
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,190
or which the hydrogen is quite similar

211
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,550
to that construction the system

212
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,280
parameter and the park a hollow same in

213
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,840
in our full single scheme each message

214
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,900
it's sorry each signature is composer

215
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,230
and plus one rock singers here we call

216
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,790
issuance at Abraxas

217
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,339
falen police this one we use schema I to

218
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,029
Tino's love first I blocks hinges this

219
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,149
one the second ginger is M concatenate

220
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,939
the first proxy ninja and the second one

221
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:18,779
is which distance come unto it denotes

222
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,420
the first two blocks changes for these

223
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,040
kinds of ginger schemes we can prove

224
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,019
that the security loss is only 100 for n

225
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,790
equal to 25

226
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,970
even Q is as large as a through 250 okay

227
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,279
in the following presentation I'm going

228
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,430
to show that the security duction for

229
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,350
our simplified scheme which an equal to

230
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,259
2 which we have the loss of fighter this

231
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,379
1/2 times the square root of Q 4 Q hash

232
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,529
occurs made by the other machine in this

233
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,509
case or simplified scheme exchanger we

234
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:58,129
are composed of three blocks inches okay

235
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:01,649
so before the instruction they may give

236
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,139
you some pretty numerous about our

237
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,290
secure adduction we try to define three

238
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,129
types of her she curates made by the FSA

239
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,889
type-0 type-1 and type-2 how to

240
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:16,860
distinguish you don't want to deal means

241
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,800
the has secure input has message only

242
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,559
okay has message only without box hinges

243
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,040
and type 1 means the how secure improved

244
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,399
has a message concatenated its first

245
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,509
proximity okay and tap to means the high

246
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,449
security put has a message can catenin

247
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,879
love first to proc changes of course the

248
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,920
other could make our ginger cure not of

249
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,179
industry test but it's okay because it's

250
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,490
not related to not used in the secure

251
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,699
adduction and this allow three types of

252
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:54,870
Raja curious definition then we also

253
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,139
have layer for cases of Curie

254
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,509
could be made by the adversary's own

255
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:03,480
messages before layer signature Curie's

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,629
for lamp all in the first case the

257
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,220
Iturbide so that rate shows a message

258
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,279
and one then goes to its signature

259
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,089
Curie's without making any

260
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,910
curious in the second case the Etowah

261
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,670
say that it shows message m to make its

262
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,610
type zero Hajduk curious lens goes to

263
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,459
its ginger Curie in the third case the

264
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,290
anniversary attack which was message m

265
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,680
she make it zero type one has a choice

266
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,009
then go to its singe Curie in the last

267
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,050
case the anniversary attitude shows

268
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,319
message m for make all three types of

269
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,529
hash queues then go to its signature

270
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,259
Curie's and for a message to be 44

271
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,470
number m 5 to forge the message m file

272
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,069
the at ability must make all three types

273
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:54,889
of hash refers be fought last inch of

274
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,899
fortune for example the adversary could

275
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,490
make the following her she kissed before

276
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,040
layer signature curious or sincere

277
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,839
fortune here since you're curious or

278
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,879
signature fortune are very important

279
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,499
because which this one are used to make

280
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:18,170
sure all these cure inputs are

281
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,379
computed by the other words rate okay

282
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,300
and how can our skin is constructed in

283
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,699
that way because we want to make sure

284
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,040
that this is the purpose that we want to

285
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,559
have we want to make sure that for the

286
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,589
same message and the attribution must

287
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,649
make its happy Rojas secure first then

288
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,569
it's happened how secure that its type

289
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:44,929
to how secure because type one hajeck

290
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,870
curious must be able to compute the

291
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,350
signature of jill has she very first and

292
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,279
have to must be able to compute the

293
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,439
signature of type one has very first

294
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,379
okay this is the some kinds of purposes

295
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,689
we want to have i want to force the

296
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:05,360
anniversary trip cure make hash queues

297
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,230
in this kinds of sequential wait and in

298
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,809
a skewed reduction the Hajek ulamas made

299
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,850
by the other versailles satisfy this

300
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,499
cancel range first

301
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,379
the llama of tap to Curie is at

302
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,819
this one because the edible she must

303
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,319
because we assume the other can forge a

304
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,959
signature so there must have at least

305
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,930
one

306
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,730
have to how secure is made the patio

307
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,190
Vassar it and because of the we assumed

308
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,160
we defined the lumber up has pure made

309
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,650
the body also is pure so the type to

310
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,260
curious that's thank you okay but here

311
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,029
the most important thing is that the

312
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:44,279
lumber of type one how secures is

313
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,180
unknown

314
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,589
this one will be totally or tentatively

315
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,240
define or decided by the anniversary

316
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
this is the code or our deduction

317
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,490
the park is g2a which are to reduce

318
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,670
through CDT assumption and is the city

319
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,700
assumption and so alpha is a and in a

320
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,980
secured adduction only one huh security

321
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,050
will be disappointing Eugene G to be and

322
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,860
mostly important this cure is not rental

323
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,690
in children okay I went reduce how to

324
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,150
how to chose this cure and all other

325
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,220
curious will be responding urgency to

326
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,790
death for all known that somebody had by

327
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,920
the simulator such that the

328
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
corresponding procs injure is sim unit a

329
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,350
book or computable and in its kind of

330
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,300
reduction the simulator we are used a

331
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,140
type 1 or type 2 touch POS made by the

332
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,800
atashi to find the solution to the city

333
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,950
h-bomb and which type is depend on the

334
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,140
secure interaction but I want to

335
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,990
emphasize that whether it's people on

336
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,500
how secure or tap to ask you this one

337
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,110
doesn't know how to be related to the

338
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,620
forge related to the forge changer or

339
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,959
related to the message and start to be

340
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,890
fortune okay so in details if a pepper

341
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,400
to has a cure for message m is

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
responding agency to be then we have a

343
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,589
type one has security for the same

344
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,079
message for the same message contains

345
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,059
the city edge contain the city a true

346
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,250
solution because the type one hajeck

347
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,369
URIs contains the first block signature

348
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,250
when this block swing is the city edge

349
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,420
solution okay

350
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,510
similarly if a type one has a if a type

351
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,310
one has a cure for message m is

352
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,320
responding millions it will be then

353
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,360
- huh security for the same message

354
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,120
contains the city edge solution because

355
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,570
the type to hash Curie here contains two

356
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,910
proxy ninjas and the second proximity

357
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,030
actually is the solution to the city - a

358
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,250
serious problem so these are high level

359
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,010
description of ash reduction let's have

360
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,280
a detailed look suppose the Atteberry

361
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,980
can thought since it and we know

362
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,290
difference condition we note the

363
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,310
anniversary we make tap one q8

364
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,820
normal N squared or Q so firstly lost

365
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,460
immunity we urgently chose K from the

366
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,200
set 1 2 3 2 squared or cubed which we

367
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,350
secret to the a tapestry none the Adhan

368
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,350
the simulator we are wait for the case

369
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,770
type 1 how to cure it from the atashi

370
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,480
and responded to this cure using T to P

371
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,730
because this one's condition or type

372
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,600
future must be made after layer type 1

373
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,720
has occurs on the same message and type

374
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,530
1 curious is normally schedule Q so we

375
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,370
have any type chill how secure is for

376
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,530
the message with the probability 1 over

377
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,740
schedule Q according to logic assumption

378
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,430
one temperature hot key must be made by

379
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,370
the atashi for signature for G so we

380
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,950
have the hash curious contains the city

381
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,140
as a solution with the property 1 over

382
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,680
the square or cube for the second case

383
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,260
suppose the anniversary we are forge a

384
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,620
signature and we know it will make type

385
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,960
1 has period more than this cancel

386
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,870
lumbar support work queue well for this

387
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,000
one we need to change less security

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,350
action that Kate we generally chose from

389
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,820
the set 1 2 3 2 Q here is Q which is

390
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,540
also our secret to the other betray then

391
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,130
letting the way ways for a case

392
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,220
happy deal here's tablet of choice for

393
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,170
only a debauchery and we are responding

394
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,980
to we respond to the secure using G 2 P

395
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,880
similarly or

396
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,910
pack one curious must be made after they

397
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,050
attack us on the same message so and the

398
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,070
tap 0qe is normal and on the shoe so we

399
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,070
have any

400
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,870
tebron cure is for the message m with

401
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,210
the probability 1 over Q ok and because

402
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,830
according to this assumption more than

403
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,470
scheduled cute aberrant curious we army

404
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,790
made by the adversary so we have one

405
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,890
lock type one purist is for the

406
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,320
message and with the probability this

407
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,080
relates policies the number of

408
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,420
parameters times the probability 1 over

409
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,690
Q in this case the Hodgkiss contains the

410
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,390
city ocean with the probability 1 over

411
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,610
square root 2 so we have suppose the

412
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,220
double can forge a signature and if we

413
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,800
know the edible tree will make type 1

414
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,850
has curious less than or more than the

415
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,100
schedule Q we can program the sakura

416
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,290
duction different tree ok we program the

417
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,420
skew little differently such that the

418
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,360
success property is always what R

419
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,700
squared Rho Q we don't know how many

420
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,250
type 1 hash queue will be made by the

421
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,130
adversary because it's a attentively

422
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,430
decided by the adversary but we can

423
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,770
guess love judge correctly that's then

424
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,870
or monent with the property 1 number 2

425
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,490
so therefore we have this final

426
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,750
successful probability this is the

427
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,480
minimum success property and this

428
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,850
completes the description of the

429
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,210
security action so what's the gap

430
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,070
between the impossibility and

431
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,880
possibility so first I would like to

432
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,250
emphasize that the impossibility proof

433
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,580
in the previous tree works are not wrong

434
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,030
ok they silently assume that or how she

435
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,690
cures are efficiently computable because

436
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,610
our heart seekers are efficiently

437
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,980
computable so only the forged signature

438
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,500
can be reduced to solving a compliment

439
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,580
right in this given it some code which

440
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,990
are to define some very special

441
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,880
cures like the type 1 and type 2 hash

442
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,029
occurs this Hodge cures are

443
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,459
not in efficiently computable because

444
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,069
they contained rocks inches and procs

445
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,129
injure is hard it's inefficient for the

446
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,109
adverse for the anniversary to compute

447
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,179
results the corresponding secret key and

448
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,209
then we use the logic used to solve the

449
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:29,309
underlying hub moment this is the gap

450
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,499
between the impossibility and

451
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:37,259
possibility and this work implies this

452
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,539
kind of construction implies a generic

453
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,449
construction of a single scheme with we

454
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:44,519
can transform a single scheme which loss

455
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,679
reduction to a similar scheme we saw

456
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,149
that reduction suppose Sigma M is a

457
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:53,879
cinch with those reductions we can

458
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:56,279
construct a single scheme with a

459
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,059
deduction following our define on the

460
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,009
proposed structures in the structure in

461
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,979
this way and this in this case a single

462
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:07,919
scheme has a static reduction in the

463
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,829
internal model when the deduction is

464
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:14,369
program at this one or proxy ninja's its

465
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,919
program that's reducible following our

466
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,649
approach and all the other blocks

467
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,559
changes will be broken as similar table

468
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,609
in it in this way we can have a patek

469
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,979
attraction but the conditions that this

470
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,969
one must be in the general amount only

471
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:38,369
okay we propose the first unique changes

472
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:42,269
came with a deduction this kind of work

473
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,139
bypass the impossibility Givens in this

474
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:48,569
street conference this kinds of

475
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,119
construction also implies a generic

476
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,719
approach for a patek reduction without a

477
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,299
grand installed linear in a signature

478
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,459
generation the condition is that this

479
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,199
kind of our scheme construction and

480
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,979
discounsel transformation must be in the

481
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:09,239
general model so we okay about the brief

482
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,029
story of this work I also be if the

483
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,949
impossibility results private is

484
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:16,649
impossible prep to this work and this

485
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:18,989
kind of curettage direction this kind of

486
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:21,539
idea came to my mind

487
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,169
in July last yet but I found that this

488
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,399
kind of counter example was very hard to

489
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,600
to construct so we have finally the

490
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,899
first skin on our skin with four

491
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:40,169
successive reconstruct in December last

492
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,109
year so it it took us a very long time

493
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,619
to find this kind of all those it seems

494
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,269
easier for me not that's why we spent

495
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,970
lots of time in finding the reason why

496
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,639
we can bypass these kinds of

497
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:00,299
impossibilities so about this work we

498
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,359
