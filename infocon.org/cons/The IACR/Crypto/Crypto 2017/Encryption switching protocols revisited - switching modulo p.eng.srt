1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,710
okay so let's see what an encryption

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,410
citrine protocol it's a two party

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,350
protocol introduced by cuto with us and

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,670
wash well last year a crypto it involved

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,099
two amorphic encryption scheme with

6
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,640
threshold decryption one will be

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,040
additively obama week with a red color

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,340
and one will be multiplicative glioma

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,170
Bhavik and we want to have protocols for

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,239
switching from an encryption of M with

11
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,280
the additive protocol to an equation of

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,789
the same end for the multiplicative

13
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,320
morphic encryption scheme so this switch

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,120
protocol will be a two-party protocol

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,000
and we want to have the reverse protocol

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,340
from the multiplicative encryption to

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,189
the additive encryption so for the

18
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,530
torque the red box with the net negative

19
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,540
morphic encryption of M and the blue box

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,780
multiplicative one so these kind of

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,610
encryption switching protocols gives

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,250
naturally wise to secure two-party

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,180
repetition to protocol let's see that

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,290
with an artificial example we have that

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,369
function where a is the secret input of

26
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,020
Alice and be the secret input of Bob so

27
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,350
I send Bob starts to and keep the secret

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,899
using the additive encryption scheme and

29
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,420
send the encryption of alien b2 to each

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,990
other and then both recent Bob can

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,799
compute a negative expression of a plus

32
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,240
B and a minus B and then they use the

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,040
switch protocols

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
from the additive encryption to the

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,769
mythical active one and then both can

36
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,840
compute each from decide the encryption

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,159
to the power mu and V Bar by additional

38
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,390
explanation algorithm and then sin we

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,269
want at that function with a plus we

40
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,189
have to switch back to the additive

41
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:43,260
protocol and then both can compute the

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,019
encrypted raise it and then decrypt it

43
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,049
to refer to party decryption to get the

44
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,389
wizard so yeah we have a constant number

45
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,450
of ones with respect to the expert on U

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:06,480
and V and a log of U and V operation to

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,109
compute that power so with this kind of

48
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,639
this is an artificial example but this

49
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,579
give you an idea on the winds kind of

50
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,620
function encryption switching protocols

51
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,739
are efficient both in terms of number

52
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,459
one and computation for two party

53
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,449
computation so let's see in more details

54
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,470
the original constriction of kouto aleni

55
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,819
they for the institution they use the PI

56
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,060
a encryption scheme for the additive

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,959
maahox scheme which is defined over the

58
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,959
double and red engine our salient ago

59
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,489
and they use a gavel for the imitative

60
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,150
scheme so the main technical problem is

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,590
that a gamma is personally defined for

62
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,729
the square of the world she said you can

63
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,810
define it for the symbol of really the

64
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,259
set of element of Jacobi symbol one

65
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,789
instead of an said but in order to to

66
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,020
extend it to the world group they have

67
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,540
to design a

68
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,140
raishin you know that to not lead the

69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,470
factorization of n and this give our

70
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,170
complex threshold description for a

71
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,660
gavel and this rigid in a large number

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,790
of one and it seems that it makes a

73
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,770
generic approach for designing such

74
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,630
protocol impossible so our tentative is

75
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,470
to use scheme that we designed with

76
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,500
Fabiana give me that we also go at we

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,850
say instead of the the poly scheme so

78
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,210
this CL scheme as a message space which

79
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,370
is edible Pisa where piece of pipe so

80
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,130
use that and for the mythical cheese

81
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,280
came with stick with a gavel so we only

82
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,300
have to extend a gavel over the world

83
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,060
group that the world pitted which is a

84
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,970
lot more simple than the case of the

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,270
devil and that these give rise to a

86
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,520
natural traceur description and reduce

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,900
the number of one of the original

88
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,770
constriction and by looking aspiring by

89
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,940
the co efficient of Kuto at ideally

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,450
these give rise to a simple generic

91
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,160
constellation so we see model type

92
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,940
details that constriction

93
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,280
so first let's see some building blocks

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,190
so first we use a linearly llamó fits

95
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,930
like a short scheme is that previously

96
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,500
but let's see that in more details so

97
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,860
it's a bit weak encryption scheme and we

98
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,230
suppose that the set of protects is a

99
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,430
ring and if we have an encryption of m

100
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,600
and prime we have a public function that

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,720
takes the encryption and the public key

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,350
and gives an encryption of the sum of m

103
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,990
and

104
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,350
and we also have an operation

105
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,170
skaara sort of scalar multiplication

106
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,080
there's a typo it should be an 8 here

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,390
that take as input the public key the

108
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,030
encryption of M and a and gives

109
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,800
inclusion of a times M where 8 is a

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,150
plain text so example of linearity or

111
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,100
more frequency first came out the Garba

112
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,980
thermically scheme with takes which has

113
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,370
and text space said over to that the

114
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,230
scheme that we saw and the scheme with

115
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,240
 like you mean that takes said

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,620
over P set where C is apart though many

117
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,710
others that's the one that are we used

118
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,440
here we also want to have a two-party

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,860
decryption for for was key our spiritual

120
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,190
scheme so this is a special case of

121
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,860
trestle crypto system normally have to

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,360
party here so to fix the notation ska

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,330
will be just share of the secret key of

124
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:55,560
a lease we share our pub we do fiction

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,880
as usual and so our generic notation we

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,560
suppose that the decryption protocol is

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,280
in a single one that means that is as a

128
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,840
Christian of AB combine hit with share

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,390
of the circuit keys do some computation

130
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,330
and send the result to Bob and Bob

131
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,930
finish the computation with each shell

132
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:31,940
and output there is no other round and

133
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,620
this is critical to prove the security

134
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,630
of the Geneva conception that there is

135
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,600
only a single one another with the box

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,840
that we use is a protocol for

137
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,310
multiplication

138
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,940
for linear encryption and a directive

139
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,230
protocol so we can see this patrol car

140
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,830
in many works from NPC within encryption

141
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,500
for example in a paper of command of

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,440
garden listen

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,020
so Alice and Bob start with encryption

144
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,370
of X&Y additive Egyptian and they want

145
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,420
to compute an additive encryption of the

146
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,350
product of x and y so I start to to

147
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,510
sample a random and nonzero amount of

148
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,460
the plaintext or group from X and our

149
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,670
she can compute an encryption of mine

150
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,570
use art X she sends this to to Bob she

151
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,170
also compute an encryption of our plus y

152
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,710
and initiate to party decryption with

153
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:58,800
Bob from that Bob gets our plus wide

154
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,910
multiply I use encryption of X to get

155
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,830
that and subtract this to get the

156
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,560
encryption of x times y so now let's see

157
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:21,360
the generic restriction so we start with

158
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,580
a generic position without dealing with

159
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,740
the 0 element inspired by the works of

160
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,730
cooter later Ally

161
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,890
so to simplify we need support as a set

162
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,980
of plaintiffs in the feed can be

163
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,900
something that looks like a field like

164
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,670
the dog and said anything away Santa go

165
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,050
but Paquita I so feed we start with our

166
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,650
two encryption protocol the additive one

167
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,850
and a multiplicative Li movie one over

168
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,730
the set of non zero the group of non

169
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,100
zero

170
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,930
Ament and we will suppose that we have a

171
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,870
two-party description for both

172
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,709
cryptosystem in only one one as I said

173
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,779
before this a lot to prove the zero

174
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,480
knowledge of our generic constriction

175
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,319
without any additional properties so

176
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:25,839
let's see up to switch from the additive

177
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,630
protocol to the multiplicative protocol

178
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,930
so now Alice and Bob have a shelf above

179
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,139
the additive and the manipulative

180
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,509
circuit keys of of the scheme so I start

181
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,009
to sample a random amount ah I don't see

182
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:45,550
one

183
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,730
she computes an inscription of additive

184
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,850
encryption of M times R and an

185
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,399
encryption of the inverse of oh she sent

186
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,440
that to Bob and initiate and to party

187
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,459
decryption for the other one

188
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,829
Bob gets em Stan are in the in the clear

189
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,790
and encryption of Ferdie in rush of art

190
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,730
it can multiply both to get an

191
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,410
encryption of M and we have the same

192
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,740
protocol in the other way around because

193
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,680
all that we use the error is a property

194
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,660
that we can we have a scalar

195
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,930
multiplication we can we apply a

196
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,170
plaintext by an encryption and we can do

197
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,920
that also with the additive encryption

198
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,730
so we have a simple solution and the

199
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,500
reverse is the easy

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,880
so no how can we deal with the zero

201
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,250
element again we we followed the ideas

202
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,310
of Goethe white LED we extend the

203
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,030
multiplicative scheme to deal with the

204
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,790
zero by the in defining this bit B which

205
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,030
is 1 if M is 0 and 0 if M is not you

206
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,270
like this M plus B will be always

207
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,670
nonzero and we can encrypt it with our

208
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,250
multiplicative scheme and then quit we

209
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,430
have to increase B and we want to

210
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,720
preserve the

211
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,920
wafak properties so let's see that if we

212
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,910
look at em the zero element is absorbent

213
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,260
so if we multiply to 2 m where we have

214
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,240
the truth table and for D this means

215
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,180
that we have no an or gate and we want

216
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,470
to design an encryption of B which is

217
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,180
optic with respect to 2 to the or gate

218
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,060
every debate yet from the original

219
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,200
Constitution we will do that with an

220
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,670
additive solution so we will if B is 0

221
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:27,220
we certainly want to to 0 I think if if

222
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,550
B is 1 we will consider random nonzero

223
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,120
element and like this if he had we had

224
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,930
that truth table which is the same as as

225
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,380
for B because if we had two random

226
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,010
element we get a random relevant 51

227
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,410
nonzero element if the mission space is

228
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,990
sufficiently large so we get that so

229
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,780
Big M is is M plus B we encrypt M plus B

230
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,780
that means is a mean 0 we encrypt 1 and

231
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:11,370
an additive and picture of all with a

232
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,390
nonzero element and if M is 0 Big M the

233
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,340
M plus B so this will be small m and we

234
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,050
encrypt 0 with the additive scheme and

235
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:32,290
we can decrypt easily from that so now

236
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,190
let's see how to switch so we still

237
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,360
suppose that this is the notation of the

238
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,960
previous slide in the first slide and to

239
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,380
be able to switch like in the original

240
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,280
construction will suppose that we have

241
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,140
black box and then heated 0 test two

242
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,470
party protocols that form an encryption

243
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,300
and GE encryption of X gives an additive

244
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,400
encryption of the bit B that is 1 if X

245
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,120
is zero and encryption of 0 X is not 0

246
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,050
so this can be shared with gabber check

247
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,470
it for for example but we did that

248
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,790
like black box so now how to switch

249
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,830
wilfer this extension of the

250
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,420
multiplicative scheme that build with 0

251
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,230
and to the additive scheme so we start

252
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,020
for encryption like before

253
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,190
first we switch the first coordinate

254
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,350
like before because M Big M is always

255
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,430
non zero so we can apply the previous

256
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,070
our protocol to get that we keep and

257
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,580
we've shown off Big M and now we have to

258
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,850
see if we our in this case or in this

259
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,819
case and for that we applied the other T

260
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,390
is

261
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,680
the protocol to to up and can be checked

262
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,369
that deceive the an encryption and a

263
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,109
given fiction of the complementarity

264
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:23,380
bits of the the bid be how we apply our

265
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,550
protocol that compute multiplication

266
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,230
from to additive encryption and we get

267
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,350
an encryption allocation of Bobby times

268
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,860
M and from the formula here can we check

269
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,520
that it is a V additive encryption of AB

270
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,750
so this give our protocol to switch from

271
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,210
the utility side to the at each side and

272
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,950
the reverse way is more like the same we

273
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,220
use on ezt protocol and then super we we

274
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,980
don't need to do a multiplication so the

275
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,080
way aside these are a bit more simple so

276
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,510
now let's talk about Association so now

277
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,820
our mr. space will be said over a period

278
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,830
so as I said before for the additive

279
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,740
protocol we use the CL scam as Kim is an

280
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,700
angular model type 2 system and we

281
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,360
define over class group of politic order

282
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,990
and this case will be another of

283
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,120
discriminant minus P to the third and in

284
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,610
this class group we have the property

285
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,450
that there is a subgroup of order P

286
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,120
where the discrete logarithm problem is

287
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,160
very easy just just a few operation to

288
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,690
to solve it

289
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,420
and this gives negative amalfi by

290
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,860
encrypting M in the exponent in an event

291
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,140
type scheme by equal teen

292
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,100
well we get as to the poor admin e and

293
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,770
this F is a generator of the soup group

294
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,060
where the deal is easy so we get em so

295
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,400
we don't have to restrict to small

296
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,310
messages and we have mo fear over the

297
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,930
world said about pizza for the beatific

298
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,610
ativ scheme we use a variant of a Corral

299
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,660
so we only have to extend that cable to

300
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,750
from the square of the opposite to the

301
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,320
world multiplicative group this can be

302
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,180
done like this we consider sufficient

303
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,640
hyman in that setting minus 1 is not 2

304
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,110
square so here we are diligent

305
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,910
resumption world of of M and times M it

306
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,110
would be always a square so this give M

307
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,910
if M is a square and minus M if M is a

308
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,740
non square and we also anchored the the

309
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,160
symbol like this a bit which is the Rope

310
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,450
for square and one for non square and we

311
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,230
only have to encrypt that that bit to be

312
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,900
a movie cover said that mm we can do

313
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,380
that with the curvature McAleese game so

314
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,960
yeah the German part here and here the

315
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,290
curvature Micheli encryption of the beat

316
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,600
LM so that's it for the to scheme let's

317
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,820
see our result so first we will look at

318
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,460
that we will compare the our one

319
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,440
capacity with the original solution so

320
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,210
first for the the switching protocol

321
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,850
without zero for the the additive to the

322
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,920
rickety we have the same number of wrong

323
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,690
because this is exactly the

324
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,060
the same solution but in the rivers but

325
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,060
we have the is the same protocol as

326
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,730
before so only to want but for the

327
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,270
original solution there was that a camel

328
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,450
complex a camel the Christian step test

329
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,650
lead to more one and for the full movie

330
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,550
the full ESP protocol that is with the

331
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,510
zero for the first line again this is

332
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,520
the same solution so we have the same

333
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,340
number one and for the second line we

334
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,810
have again for for one of gain of that

335
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,220
and the other one comes from the fact

336
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,710
that we entreat additively

337
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,140
the extra bit so now if we look at the

338
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,480
bit complexity so there is tuition one

339
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,680
is with the serial scam that relies on

340
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,920
the DTH and the other one is a variant

341
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,130
which less than our security exemption

342
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,400
and we can see that we are more the less

343
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,430
from the same material there are other

344
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,340
regional solution this comes from the

345
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,620
fact that the CL scheme and there's more

346
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,840
more bits we have more copper element

347
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,870
that in the the police scheme especially

348
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,460
in this case where P is very large so to

349
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,980
conclude the other things the paper so

350
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,060
the ECL scheme use a group of an audio

351
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,420
so there are some technicalities to for

352
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,890
sure in the keys so we include the key

353
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,630
generation by sampling with this

354
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,850
protrusion instead of uniform this

355
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,890
reduce the number of the number of bits

356
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,530
of the keys here we have a solution that

357
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,680
is securing the onus mysterious model

358
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,559
but it's possible to you

359
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,490
stick to against active adversary but

360
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,999
yeah I think zero knowledge proof and

361
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,970
now for the open pearl there is still

362
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,350
room for improvement we saw that there

363
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,970
is this external is it the protocol so

364
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,220
it would be interesting to find a more

365
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,499
adult method to deal with the zero

366
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:16,999
element and of course we have the

367
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,950
January condition it will be interesting

368
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,730
to find other instance for example based

369
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,610
on the lattices so this is Morris in Z

370
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,999
for the additive mocha skin but less for

371
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:33,379
the multiplicative one so that's it

372
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:36,879
thanks for your attention

373
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,499
