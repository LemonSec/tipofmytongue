1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,529
thank you very much for introduction so

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,110
my name is Jose que todo from entities

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,200
such a platform laboratories Japan so

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,560
today I'd like to talk about Cuba tax on

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,290
long black box polynomials based on

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,600
division property so this is a joint

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,449
work with Takanori is away the only how

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,260
and the way Tim are you okay so first I

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,230
want to introduce as an overview of my

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,100
talk so our new technique is a

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,290
improvement from the cube attack so cube

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,260
attack was proposed by genuine cameo at

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,909
Euro clip 2009 so cube attack is a kind

14
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,059
of higher order differential attack so

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,309
high order differential attack is one of

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,460
the most powerful and famous script

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,760
analysis technique for a block cipher so

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,629
when we attack block cipher using high

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,760
order differential attack we first

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,590
prepared the set of chosen plaintext and

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,490
we about it the sum of the corresponding

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,820
ciphertext

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,530
so if America's higher the differential

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,840
attack uses high order differential

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,870
characteristics who's the son of

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,570
ciphertext is always there so friended

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,390
block cipher is analyzed we first

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,980
prepare a high order differential

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,740
characteristics then we append key

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,380
recovery after the characteristics then

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,550
we guess sub T last round is used and

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,600
recover the ciphertext from the

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,610
intermediate texts and compute the Sun

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,970
and the body as a somebody is zero not

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,960
so if the sum is not nonzero we know the

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,390
guest round key is incorrect and we can

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,320
reduce the size of the round key space

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,960
but unfortunately this attack strategy

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,960
is not applied to stream cipher in

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,049
general because in the case of the story

41
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,319
in cipher we cannot add critical body

42
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,620
part after the characteristics so cube

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,270
attack is

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,850
so more familiar to the analysis of the

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,130
stream cipher because in the case of

46
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,220
cube attack we recover the secret key

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,120
from the from the suburbs their

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,740
corresponding output text and in other

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,160
words the qubit a clickable secret key

50
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,520
from - a differential capitalistic

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,280
directory but the most significant of

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,090
the cube attack is this is experimental

53
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,980
attack so this means we first regards to

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,170
in cipher at blackbox polynomials and

55
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,580
there we so we evaluate this black box

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,190
polynomial experimental and the body

57
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,390
eight the sum of barrio so is so in this

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,990
case as a size of Cupid this means the

59
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,300
size of an actual bit is limited to the

60
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,360
experimental rent for example sake of 40

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,430
so better in solid current we can use

62
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,610
more a number of qubits so in such case

63
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,620
we in main case we can attack more

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,480
number of rounds so in my talk I propose

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,670
cube attacks on non blackbox polynomials

66
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,300
so this means so we never leaked out

67
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,269
story in ciphers black box so we

68
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,120
perfectly analyze as a structural

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,470
storing cipher and how to linearize cube

70
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,950
attack in this situation so as a result

71
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,170
we explained the best attack on

72
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,320
caribbean grain and echo in the context

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,650
of the key recovery attack so how do we

74
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,980
get this result so we use division

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,200
property so the engine property is

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,040
proposed but propose that you crypt 2050

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,890
and this is a tool to find integrate

78
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,040
distinguish on block cipher so as far as

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
my knowledge so the division property is

80
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,710
only applied to block ciphers so I think

81
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,870
this is the first application of the

82
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,210
division property two streams

83
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,340
so but if we sink so that she only key

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,380
initialized in some part of the stream

85
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,290
cipher destroyed lecture is very similar

86
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,530
to the block cipher so if we want to

87
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,110
body eight zero sum integral distinguish

88
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,120
of stream cipher

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,960
this application is trivial but so she

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,200
recovery is non-trivial so I want to

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,640
propose how to recover the secret key

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,570
so to legalize this key recovery path to

93
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,100
recovery attack so I explained what the

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,190
division property can do and so I

95
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,730
propose a new how to use the division

96
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,919
property as a result we can get secret

97
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,830
key variables that are not involved to

98
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,010
the still pop or it and finally the from

99
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,900
this marriage we can recover so secret

100
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,970
key okay so let's that main topic so now

101
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,630
let's consider the stream cipher so in

102
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,530
the in this pit as write this picture so

103
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,180
the input is to value X and 3 and X is

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,090
and its secret variables and buoys and

105
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,030
Beach public variables and their price a

106
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,110
stream cipher and Z is possibly took the

107
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
key string in such case we began stream

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,140
cipher adds one boolean function from n

109
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,020
plus M bits to one bit so now so we

110
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,919
apprise a cube attack so in the in the

111
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,430
cube attack we must prepare to index I

112
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:24,320
and so is index item to III and this led

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,610
part is activates and other party's

114
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,050
inactive then we compute the sum of the

115
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,950
cube of the first bit of the history and

116
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,370
C is a set of 2 to the I values where

117
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,620
Bri is active so in this case

118
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,020
so boolean function as is decomposed

119
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,540
into write this and Tia is this monomial

120
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,500
so in such case

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,880
it's the sum of the cube so we get P I

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,620
x3 and so attacker D covers the secret

123
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,590
variables X by analyzing this plea I at

124
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,050
this podium function and in the tech in

125
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,810
the cube attack we call ki super police

126
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,100
but so f is a stream cipher and stream

127
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,740
cipher is very complicated structure so

128
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,110
it is very difficult to the compost

129
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,530
boolean function f into like this so

130
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,800
previous cube attack uses experimental

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,830
approach so now we want to recover the

132
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,480
algebraic normal form of the super power

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,870
so we assume super parades linear

134
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,950
function and we compute so the sum of

135
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,660
cube for randomly chosen X and so check

136
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,360
linearity test in many times in so

137
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,400
linearity test always pass so if there

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,210
this NF of the super power is almost may

139
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,300
be linear a boolean function so if the

140
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,880
super power is a linear function we can

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,250
recover the algebraic normal form of the

142
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,360
super power

143
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,090
and finally we can recover secret key

144
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,280
but in this approach so in the second

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,310
phase so we have to sum of the cube so

146
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,080
if the size of cube is for example 40 so

147
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,380
it is very difficult to compute this

148
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,190
variation in practical time so there in

149
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,799
previous cube attacks this it is

150
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,429
experiment or attack so I compared to

151
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,230
this experimental attack to so little

152
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,390
attack and so for the solid core attack

153
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,880
we use the division property to analyze

154
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,030
algebraic normal form previous attack so

155
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,610
algebraic to normal form is analyzed by

156
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,990
experimental you

157
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,780
linearity pest but we analyze the

158
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,670
algebraic to normal form by using the

159
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,210
division property so digital property

160
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,620
was proposed that uroclub 2050 and so it

161
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,780
is true to find the integral

162
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,640
distinguished and definition it's like

163
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,340
this so it's a little complicated so so

164
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,150
I skip this definition so the most

165
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,800
important part is division trade so so

166
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,690
similar to the financial tax allistic

167
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,790
and rainier characteristics so there is

168
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,310
also division property characteristics

169
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,220
so if we have Kaiser is division

170
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,040
property and the propagation world digit

171
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,850
7 ki over K R so it was so the trade k

172
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,360
from kaiser to KL satisfying propagation

173
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,210
rule of the division property we call

174
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,750
this trade is division trail so the most

175
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,080
important part is if there is not

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,230
division trail from Kaiser to ej means

177
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,710
the unit vector in such case the J's bit

178
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,530
of ciphertext is always balanced so but

179
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,460
this variation is in main case varied so

180
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,560
difficult so in practical time so but

181
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,980
Asia crypt last year sham proposed new

182
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,480
methods to about for the variations that

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,380
propagation characteristic of the

184
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,020
division property so he used

185
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,250
GP based solvents so for example Mir P

186
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,080
and subset s emiti and constraint

187
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,710
programming so asked for such solvers

188
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,320
help we can practically a body it's the

189
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,690
division trial so if the server I'll set

190
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,360
this trade is infeasible

191
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,780
we know the J speeds is bad in other

192
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,400
words so the affairs so sober answers

193
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,000
it's possible it's feasible so Jay Z it

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,020
is unknown so we directly apply this

195
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,080
technique to

196
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,910
stream cipher and we get integral

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,920
distinct issue there are some

198
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,060
distinguishes so now we get the fat

199
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,920
prepare the division property for the

200
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,100
chosen plaintext and there K and there

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,500
is corresponding to the secretary and

202
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,530
the K is corresponding with the qubit so

203
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,830
now we checked division trade from 0 K -

204
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,250
1 and if no division trade we know the

205
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,200
sum of the sum of the output is already

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
but unfortunately we cannot recover

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,730
secretly only by this approach so to

208
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,740
recover so secretly so we propose a new

209
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,090
application of the theorem division

210
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:03,700
property so we never use division

211
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,070
property to find their sum integral

212
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,850
distinguishes so we division property is

213
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,100
used to analyze any coefficients so we

214
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,560
first evaluate the number of involved

215
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,830
key bits that of qubits and the weekend

216
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,510
guarantees the upper bound of the time

217
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,400
complexity to recover the energy of the

218
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,920
super boring so to understand this

219
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,440
technique we first explain the basic

220
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,800
knowledge of algebraic number 4 so now F

221
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,990
is a boolean function and this is the

222
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,920
algebraic number form so and AF is a and

223
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,900
F coefficients so of course it's

224
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,780
practically invisible to an eyes or any

225
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,820
privations now we first the compose a

226
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,910
boolean function f in according to the

227
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,970
vector K such that X to the K is

228
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,580
monomial so in such case we can

229
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,800
decompose boolean function like this so

230
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,630
now we know this part is algebraic

231
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,810
normal form of the super power now

232
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,700
assuming there is not division train

233
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,410
from K to 1 so we know the sum of F is

234
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,010
equal to super / e is equal to this

235
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,180
algebra coma

236
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,040
for it's always there for a brownie X in

237
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,130
other words we know are they back to

238
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,670
normal from absence such that U is

239
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,310
greater than equal to K it's always

240
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,480
there so this means by using the

241
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,270
division property we can know and F

242
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:53,470
coefficients their own so now we extend

243
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,650
this idea to key recovery attack

244
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,380
assuming there is not a division train

245
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,840
ejk to one so previously this part is

246
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,250
zero but now we add unit vector J AJ

247
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,720
then L F is valid if there is not such

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,020
division trail we know NF Co absent such

249
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,870
that U is greater than call EJ care is

250
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,590
always zero in such case so we know

251
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,030
super power is like this and if you J

252
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,580
it's one so from this marriage we know a

253
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,990
corresponding end of coefficients is

254
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,160
always zero

255
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,100
so this polynomial is equal to this

256
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,430
polynomial but now UJ is always zero

257
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,510
this means XJ is independent from super

258
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,750
boring so this is the summary of the

259
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,460
result so now we get we first prepare

260
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,620
the corresponding division property ejk

261
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,650
and check division trade if there is no

262
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,230
division trail we know XJ is not

263
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,290
involved to the super Pauline

264
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,180
so by repeating this procedure this

265
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,560
means we repeat we went to N and we know

266
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,440
which secret variables are involved to

267
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,820
the super Polly so now weeks play

268
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,640
attacked precision attack strategy so

269
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,970
attack strategy consists of three part

270
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,730
variations of right and online fix so of

271
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,150
course

272
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,710
so previous so previous cube attack

273
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,260
analyzes up to off right face but our

274
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,520
attack is practical up to evaluation

275
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,329
phase so offline phases

276
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:41,809
the only guaranteed from the upper bound

277
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,170
of the time complexity so this is a

278
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,290
variation face so first we decide the

279
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,350
position of active beats I and prepare

280
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,559
the set J is the empty set and we check

281
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,589
the division trail is from a JK to 1 and

282
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,519
if there is such trade so this index J

283
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,910
is inserted into the sex trade if there

284
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,160
is no such right so we don't in such so

285
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,480
finally we know the state J and this set

286
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,689
contains bits that may be imported the

287
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:22,160
super boring next so off right face we

288
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,540
prepare we decide initial I agree break

289
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,730
London and repeat the set of children I

290
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,429
bridge by flipping bits in activates and

291
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:38,179
the computer son so but we know the

292
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,449
secret barrier and only David the size

293
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:43,999
of jab its secret barriers are involved

294
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:49,610
so we so other other so L - the size of

295
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,249
J bits are not involved so we can

296
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:55,369
perfectly compute and destroy the table

297
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:59,480
of the samo killed with time complexity

298
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,619
- to the I project so if the size of

299
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,109
killed for us the size of improbable two

300
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,898
secret variables it's smaller than the

301
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:12,819
security level so offline faces so

302
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,909
faster than you saw such and finally we

303
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,609
try online we recover the secret

304
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,359
variables in deal so access encryption

305
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,939
Oracle and compute this time and we

306
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:31,279
check just we compared this some value

307
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,720
from somebody in online page and so if

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,870
this somebody is different the guessed

309
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,100
the secret barrier is incorrect so the

310
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,340
data complexity is to the die

311
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,039
so now we apply this idea to stream

312
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,240
cipher trinium

313
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,980
so Trivium has

314
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,080
this type structure and so secretly is

315
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,260
80-bit and initialization vector is 80

316
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,830
bits and secret key is inserted into

317
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,059
these parts and IP is inserted into this

318
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:14,600
patch so the number of lounge of the

319
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:22,750
Trivium is 1,000 and 150 to rot so first

320
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,970
to verify our idea experimental so we

321
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,919
try small chip sites so in this in this

322
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,950
example sorry the number of active I

323
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,390
will tell so we choose this can be

324
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,260
disassembled active avoid in such case

325
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,809
so we know this five bits are involved

326
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:50,090
to the secret key by body ating the

327
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,100
propagation the division property as

328
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,400
well is that we know we attacked five

329
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,970
nine ball mount so the time complexity

330
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,400
is 2023 turtles are subtle and complex

331
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,690
so in this case so if we choose this IP

332
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,140
so inside so the superpower is like this

333
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,750
and it builds the Cypress to topple is

334
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,520
like this if we use this Cypress in

335
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
super practice so in this case these two

336
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,400
super quarry is not balanced function

337
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,669
but the bottom line is bounce function

338
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,980
so we can recover the secret key we can

339
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,780
become as a one bit of secret key

340
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:39,230
information by using this iDream so now

341
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,799
we try the savage carry evaluation so

342
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,620
the most interesting result is this part

343
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,150
so if we choose number of active Ibis is

344
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,270
72 and this is a active index in this

345
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,790
case the number of involved kids is only

346
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,190
5 so we can attack this trade premium

347
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,460
with reduce the number brown dates reach

348
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,630
it's two to the 77 of course exhaustive

349
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:18,800
searches are two to the 80 okay so next

350
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,470
finally I explained as other

351
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,460
applications

352
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,710
so I also applied this technique to

353
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,430
grain 1/2 H a and a comb

354
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:32,120
so grain want to Edwards already broken

355
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,760
by the dynamic tube attack but great 1/2

356
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,750
H egg was having survived so prettiest

357
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,080
best part is 100 times 77 rounds and

358
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,110
it's only distinguishing but so our

359
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,480
attack rate is 183 lands and it's

360
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,660
possible to recover the secret key and

361
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,970
in the case of a calm so this is around

362
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,670
the sovereign Caesar candidates so

363
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,390
previous Cuba that is 477 rounds but our

364
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,429
back breaks 700 forums so finally I

365
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,570
conclude my talk so I propose Cuba tax

366
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,770
on no black box polynomials so I propose

367
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,440
a new methods to how to use the division

368
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
property so previously division property

369
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,110
is a simple tool to find to detect

370
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,370
integral distinguish but so in this from

371
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,250
this paper in this paper I use the

372
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,620
division property to analyze a and F

373
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:44,390
coefficients so in this approach so the

374
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,520
cryptographer only creating a

375
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,770
multi-modal for the division property

376
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,200
and so a variation is what a variation

377
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,050
was down from the MIP

378
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,280
solvents so the cost is very small and

379
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,059
so it is very easy to apply this

380
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:05,840
technique to

381
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,450
barrios stream cipher so and so digital

382
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,540
property is more practical an

383
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,210
experimental approach so we can bury a

384
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,840
tuba

385
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,910
even if the size of Cuba is a soda

386
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,030
challenge so for example so in the case

387
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,100
of best attack on tribum we use 72 bits

388
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,290
cubed so it is practically infeasible to

389
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,160
check such huge cube experimental in now

390
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,000
so but we can so predict the security of

391
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,550
the Trivium in future so thank you very

392
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,810
much

393
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:47,839
