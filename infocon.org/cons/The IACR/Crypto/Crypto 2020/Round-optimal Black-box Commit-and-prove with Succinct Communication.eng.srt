00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,319
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,959
i'm susan kiyoshima from entity research

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,120
i'm going to talk about my work land

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,559
optimal blackboard commit and proof

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
with saxon communication

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,400
as the title of this work suggests in

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,400
this work

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,359
we study succinct commitment broadcast

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,598
in particular we obtain a new commitment

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,359
protocol by using a two-long saxon

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,558
document

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
so in this talk i will first explain two

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,559
run success arguments

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,160
and the commitment protocols and next

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,839
explain our results and techniques

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,199
so let's begin from turnout success

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,000
argument

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
so what is a succinct argument a

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
succinct argument

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
is a two-party protocol between approval

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
p and the verifier v

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,959
the goal of a succinct argument is that

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,760
the variable compresses the verifier of

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
the correctness of the statement

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
in this word we focus on two run succeed

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,720
argument

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,159
so the protocol consists of just a

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,560
message

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,080
the first message is a query message

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
from the verifier

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,679
and the second message is the answer

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,799
message from the developer

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
for the security succinct succinct

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
argument are required

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
to satisfy completeness and soundness

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
whereas the

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,119
completeness requires that when the

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
statement is true

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,600
the very buyer always accept approve

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
made by honest brewer

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
and the sound is required that when the

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
statement is worth

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,720
the verifier rejects any proof made by

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
malicious workers

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,479
and additionally as an influence

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
requirement

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,640
a success argument required to satisfy

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,720
succinctness

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
which requires that the communication

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
complexity is very small

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,439
so for example it is often required that

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,479
the communication complexity is

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,839
politicalism

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,360
in t where it is terminated for checking

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,120
whether the statement is true

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
or not and here i would like to note

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
that

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
all the succinctness sometimes also

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
requires that

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
the running time the verifier is very

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
small

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
in this work we only cause the

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
succinctness of the communication

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,239
complexity

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
and informally speaking the existing two

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
rounds of

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
argument can be separated into two

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
groups

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
so the first group is the skin peso

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
known force well assumption

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,480
and the second one is the scan based on

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,239
force 5 assumption

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
so regarding the scheme based on

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,480
non-positive assumption

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
all i need to say is that no virtual

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,518
assumption

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,679
are considered as a strong assumption in

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
theoretical cryptographies

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,959
so even though many of the schemes based

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
on

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,159
non-forcible assumptions such by really

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
property and practical identity

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,760
in this work we do not consider these

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
skills

85
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,159
and rather we focus on the scan based on

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
forceful assumptions

87
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,319
and the particular we focus on the scan

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,359
by karli last lawsuit program

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
and the subsequent works so from now on

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
whenever i say

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,799
a success argument i always mean success

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
argument based on fortunes

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
45 assumptions

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,080
and this game are not as powerful as the

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,560
scheme based on non-possible assumption

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
but still they satisfy a several nice

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
property like

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,720
they can prove any statement in p or

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,440
even some statement taking carpet

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,120
and those they can be proven sound and

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
stunt assumption like uh

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,440
life with error or more concretely

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
support really homophobic

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,400
encryption or to run the private

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,040
information deliver systems

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
so essentially what i would like to say

107
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
in this line

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
is that we already have a really good

109
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,798
result want to observe two round succeed

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,518
arguments

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,400
based on four is based on four four is

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,400
five assumptions

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
so now uh given this state of earth

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
a natural question to ask is the

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,238
feasibility of day and the succinct

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,840
protocol by using

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,080
a torah success argument so for example

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,960
since the interactive argument has been

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,198
used in many cryptographic protocols

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,359
in the form of several arguments or

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,600
which is indistinguishable argument

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
i think it is natural to earn creates a

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
weakling succinct version of

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
this cryptographic protocol by just

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
using existing tools of

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
success argument a set up normal

127
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
inductive argument

128
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,639
unfortunately there are several

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,199
difficulties to understand

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,720
and the world main difficulty is that

131
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,880
the existing two-round succinct

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
parliament are less powerful in several

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
aspects

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,160
when they are compared with the typical

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,638
non-succinct argument in cryptocurrency

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
so the first weakness of the existing

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,440
dual sex argument

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,800
is that the current results for occupy

139
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,440
is not guaranteed so this means that

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,039
for each application we need to see what

141
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
kind of employee statement need to be

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
proven

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
and then we need to see whether such

144
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,758
such statement can be proven by

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
existing through our success

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
and the second weakness is that the

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,400
witness privacy is not guaranteed

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
and this means that we need a consider

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,039
addition mechanism for character

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,080
witness privacy like which is a distinct

151
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,320
security or their

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,719
marriage and the third weakness

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,000
is that the public verified authority is

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
not guaranteed

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
at least we will focus on scan based on

156
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,840
well-studied assumptions like

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,400
lagging with error so this means that

158
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
the verifier query has subsequent

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
information

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,840
and the verification cannot be made

161
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
without this secret information

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,198
so despite this difficulty we actually

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,758
have

164
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,440
a few examples we using a succinct

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
argument to obtain other success

166
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,039
protocols such as

167
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,638
success access control for more

168
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,120
performance structure

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,120
and success not secure computation

170
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
however the number of application is

171
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,120
still limited

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,599
so it's important to study more about

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,720
whether they exist any other application

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
during sex environment

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
and as i said earlier in this work we

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,359
study

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,680
applications to create a report course

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
so next let me explain commitment

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
protocol

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
so what is the community protocol

181
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
accommodate

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,039
protocol is basically a commitment scan

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
that has

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,880
additional properties so in particular

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,039
in the community the group can commit to

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,479
its sequel input just as in standard

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
continuous skill

188
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,639
and later in the additional approval

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
phase the program can prove any

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,680
statement of the committed value

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,840
without opening openings so in

192
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
particular for any attack range of the

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
function

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,120
f the everyone can prove that the

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,080
quantity variable w satisfy

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,160
f of w is equal to one

197
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
the most famous application of the

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
community protocol

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,120
is a compiler from a stamina security to

200
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,680
malicious security

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
so suppose there exists a seminars

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,280
protocol

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
in which if you wants and a message to a

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,080
party p2

205
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,120
so by using the commitment protocol we

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,000
can make this protocol manchester secure

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,000
by considering the protocol where p1

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,520
first commit the random string 1

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,080
r1 by using a protocol and then

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,639
after receiving a random string r2 for

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,758
p2

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
p1 computes a message m using r1 plus r2

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
as a randomness

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,879
and then prove by using a contemporary

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,560
protocol that

216
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
it computed and honestly

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,878
and here i would like to know that we

218
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
cannot replace the commitment

219
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
protocol with the standard commitment

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,360
scheme and the severance argument for

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,720
output when blackboard's use of the

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,240
cryptographic operative

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,399
is desirable so this is because

224
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,479
the use of servant argument for all and

225
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,479
be inherently requires

226
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
non-profit access to the code of the

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
primitive like

228
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,599
christmas schemes and in contrast of the

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
community protocol can build blackbox in

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,839
the sense that

231
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,959
it uses the underlying cryptography only

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,279
practically

233
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,199
so currently we already have uh several

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,000
blackboard constructions of

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
commitment protocols and in particular

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
we have

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,440
both the land optimal construction and

238
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,000
the success construction

239
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
here the land optimal construction have

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,839
foreign

241
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
and this is optical in the sense that

242
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
this construction can be used as

243
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,839
blackbox several arguments

244
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,399
which are known to require a terrorist

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,279
product

246
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,920
however we currently do not have

247
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,519
construction that the most round optimal

248
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,199
unsuccess

249
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:37,120
and this is what we study in this world

250
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
so now let me explain our result

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
so our result is a succinct

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
communication protocol that satisfies

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,920
the following properties

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,920
first our basics our basic scams certify

255
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
witness in distinct purity and the

256
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
constant sound

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
error and it can be upgraded into one

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
with

259
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
zero knowledge and negligible sound

260
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,319
error by using

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,760
a existing transformation by karana

262
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,880
ostrowski and the syringe

263
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
second our commitment protocol has four

264
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,160
round

265
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,240
and after being upgraded into zero

266
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,560
knowledge and level sound error

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
this round of complexity is optimal when

268
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,439
our system

269
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,079
protocol is used as a postural

270
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,079
adjustment

271
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,000
third our protocol only requires

272
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,479
relatively mind assumption

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and in particular it only requires a

274
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
substantially hard

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
collision business hash function to run

276
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
the private information video level

277
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
and the two rounds of oblivious transfer

278
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,319
protocols

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
and here i would like to note that the

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
subject matter hard and serious warriors

281
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,200
since the

282
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,599
analysis we use complexity balancing

283
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,800
techniques

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,720
and finally our medium protocol is

285
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,959
blackbox in the sense that

286
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,399
it uses the underlying cryptographic

287
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,399
primitive only aggregate

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,680
now i have explained our results in the

289
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,239
rest of the talk i will i'm going to

290
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
explain

291
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
techniques

292
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,880
so the starting point of our

293
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
construction is

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
following a non-success construction

295
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,000
based on the famous uh

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,040
npc in the head technique the assumed

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,320
that

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,719
we have two private impact mpc protocol

299
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
where

300
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
m is any constant and that's when for

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,200
simplicity that

302
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,200
this npc is deterministic

303
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,079
so in the community phase the probably

304
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,239
split its secret input w

305
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,479
into fc crystals w1 to double m

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,560
and coming to each of these shares by

307
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
using any success commitment scheme

308
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,439
in the proof phrase for adaptable chosen

309
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
statement f

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,959
the approval first runs the npc program

311
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
in his head

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,040
where the input design proteins are the

313
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,000
m3 crystals

314
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,560
that we want to double m respectively

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
and

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,839
the functionality to be computed is f

317
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,839
prime

318
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,360
where a prime is a functionality that

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
takes the sequential

320
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,079
input and then deconstruct the secretary

321
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,160
conor share on the various statement f

322
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
and the deconstructed shipping type

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,319
then the proof and amplifier executes

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
the

325
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
two-round ot protocol where the priebus

326
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
sends

327
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
the commitment to the mcgregor along

328
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,079
with

329
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,199
along with the mtc view of the m parties

330
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,479
and the verifier picks a london pair

331
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,680
time bishop party ice stone chester and

332
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
obtaining a master and majesta which

333
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
includes the secret share on the bishop

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
views of

335
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,518
iceland gesture

336
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,399
finally the verifier checks whether the

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
ambitious views of

338
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,560
einstein gesture certifies the foreign

339
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,119
conditions

340
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
first the ambitious views of iso

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,519
ancestry are consistent

342
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,439
in the sense that in the views the

343
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,160
messages that leicester sent to

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,680
jester recorded the messages of just a

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,519
receiver faster and vice versa

346
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,000
second in the pills the input to iceland

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
gesture equal to the competition crochet

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
double einstein double chest which is

349
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,760
specified obtaining

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,880
the resultable third

351
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,639
interviews the output of ice digester

352
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,519
and both equal to

353
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,800
now let's see this game is uh two

354
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
reasons in this type of

355
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
written distance

356
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,600
first this game is which is

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
indistinguishable because

358
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
the standard privacy of old guarantees

359
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,959
that the periphery obtains

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
absolute views of at most two parties

361
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,239
and

362
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,160
the two privacy of npc guarantees that

363
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
the peripheral cannot apply any security

364
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,959
information in this case

365
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,439
next this game certifies soundness

366
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,079
because of the following reasons

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
first the receiver privacy of ot

368
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,839
guarantees that

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,399
in order to convince the with

370
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,639
substantially high probability

371
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
the program need to send the asset of

372
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,160
npc people

373
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,920
such that each pair of the mpc view

374
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,199
satisfies the three conditions that

375
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,000
the verifier checks in the verification

376
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
now it is not hard to see that in this

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,639
case

378
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
the correctness of the pc guarantees

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
that

380
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,959
the output of the functionality f prime

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,279
for input

382
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
the condition quantity shared that we

383
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,760
want to double

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,399
m is equal to 1 and this

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,199
from the definition of f prime it

386
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,920
follows that

387
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,760
its output of the statement f on the one

388
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,560
if it's accumulated

389
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,120
w is also equal to 1.

390
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,000
and finally this game is not succinct

391
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,920
because

392
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
the purpose and the secret share of the

393
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,279
commented value other than disputes

394
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
as the revolting protocols

395
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,320
now uh our high-level idea to

396
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,959
upgrade this non-successful construction

397
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,600
into a stock secret construction

398
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,079
is to let the group approve the

399
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,839
consistency of review etc

400
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:31,040
by using a two-round suction drug

401
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
that is uh because the protocol where

402
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,480
instead of extending and he views

403
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,719
themselves the people

404
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,680
just give succinct commitment over the

405
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639
views

406
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,239
and then proves that the hpl's are

407
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
committed and precipitates are

408
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
consistency

409
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,639
consistent etc by sending a succinct

410
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,599
argument for each pair of the views

411
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,880
as a resulting protocol so in two

412
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
thousand three percent

413
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
ms square success arguments result

414
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,360
problems

415
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,680
so good news is that even after this

416
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,439
demotivation

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,959
which is interesting abilities still

418
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,759
hold

419
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,359
so in particular even though uh existing

420
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
two construction argument does not

421
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
provide

422
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
us privacy uh this is not problematic

423
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
since the verify obtain a succinct

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,240
argument

425
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,320
only for a pair of parties and the two

426
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,480
privacy of a pc guarantee that

427
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
the verifier cannot run any security

428
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
information from the pc

429
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
over any two parties

430
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
however a problem occurs in the proof of

431
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
standards

432
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
and in particular the problem is that

433
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,199
the existing

434
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,518
two-run success argument are not for the

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,758
sum for the particular statement we

436
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
consider

437
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,240
the record that we because the protocol

438
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,959
where the blueprint keeps a succinct

439
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,519
argument for each payoffs and pc parties

440
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,959
and in each of this taxing argument the

441
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,000
statement is that

442
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,119
the existing input or signature

443
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,799
w1 to double j and then view

444
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,239
v and pj such that first they are called

445
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,799
they are committed in the success

446
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,280
commitment and the second

447
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,280
views are consistent consistent etc

448
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,280
now luckily speaking uh the analysis of

449
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,760
the existing success argument

450
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,799
does not work for this particular

451
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
statement

452
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,440
since some element of the writtens in

453
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,280
particular ambitious views

454
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,400
pl and pj commented adaptively after the

455
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,399
peripheral sense

456
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,799
query message queue of the succinct

457
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
argument

458
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,960
so indeed if the indirectness

459
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
was committed and unadaptably just like

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
ambitious

461
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,639
input w and double j in the phase

462
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
since the analysis of the existing

463
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
suction argument could be used naturally

464
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
for

465
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,240
setting as well so essentially the

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
problem is that the weakness includes

467
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
mppus

468
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
via pg

469
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,000
now our solution to this problem is to

470
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
analyze the soundness of all the

471
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,679
succinct argument joint

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,919
so that is rather than individually

473
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,960
analyzed each accident argument

474
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,120
given for hpm given for each pair of

475
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,400
automatic amphibious

476
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
we jointly analyze the ms grid succinct

477
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,280
argument

478
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,159
as simultaneously so the key point is

479
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
that

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
if we annotate all the success argument

481
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,919
jointly

482
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
essentially the witness uh witnesses

483
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,919
that we should able to abuse

484
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
all the party is that with those of only

485
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,320
a pair of parties

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,480
and since the empty input of all the 30

487
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
uniquely determined bishop views of

488
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
all the proteins we can analyze sounds

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,760
as if

490
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,160
the witnesses ambush input alone

491
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,520
and now as i said earlier since the

492
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
input

493
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,440
uh are committed not adaptably in the

494
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,879
commit phase

495
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
in this case the analysis of the

496
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,520
existing dual socks argument can be used

497
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,479
naturally for accepting as well

498
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
so unfortunate news on distribution is

499
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
that

500
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,720
in order to formalize this idea both the

501
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,959
constructions and

502
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
the analysis need to rely on global

503
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,080
detail of the succinct argument

504
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,879
of krr-14

505
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,439
so i won't explain the detail but i just

506
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
would like to know that

507
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,919
non-significant modification is required

508
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,320
and only

509
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,840
natural adjustments are required so to

510
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,720
conclude

511
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,480
this is a summary of our result so thank

512
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
you for listening
