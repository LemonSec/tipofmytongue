i think the people that made uh crypto

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,440
possible

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,280

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:26,319
uh so i would start with uh danielle

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,760

one of the crypto 2020 program co-chairs

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,560

give him a plaque with the

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,120

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,159
this now has to be done in a virtual

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
setting

72
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239

uh towards making crypto possible in

169
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,319
this virtual setting

170
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
session

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,879
thank you okay uh thank you so the next

175
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
uh

176
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,879
speaker is actually as he already

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,198
mentioned thomas mister part who will

178
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,000
uh say a little bit on how to program

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,160
from a chair

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,160
so on behalf of both of the program

181
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
chairs

182
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
okay can you hear me yes loudly

183
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,479
excellent

184
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,878
and you can see and you can see the

185
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,878
slides

186
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
okay great uh so we we had a less clever

187
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,318
title

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
than uh what uh the trump session chairs

189
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,280
uh came up for us

190
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
with but uh yeah i'll just uh speak for

191
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,159
a few moments on behalf of uh danielle

192
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
and myself

193
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,319
and of course danielle can interrupt at

194
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,359
any moment to disagree with anything i'm

195
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
saying

196
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
of course it was quite an honor to be

197
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
chosen to be

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,120
uh asked to be program chairs for crypto

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
2020

200
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
particularly because of the fact it was

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
the 40th anniversary of this conference

202
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
and this amazing

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
community that we've all uh

204
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,800
professionally grown up in

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,640
so um obviously

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,719
uh we aren't in the place where we

207
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,600
normally are and

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
this year was particularly challenging

209
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
um

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
both as program chairs and for all the

211
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,680
other organizational tasks for crypto

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
uh because of the pandemic um

213
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
i'll have the dates on the next slide

214
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,959
but you know the

215
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,240
bulk of the reviewing process happened

216
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,518
uh during the

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,240
uh when many countries had lockdowns

218
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
and it was really inspiring to see the

219
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
work of the reviewers

220
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,040
uh as they kind of work through all

221
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,200
sorts of

222
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
problems like being stranded uh there's

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
illness we

224
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
unfortunately have deaths and families

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,519
um many of our colleagues

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,440
were enlisted into doing emergency work

227
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
on contact racing

228
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
and more and despite all that we were

229
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
able to uh

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,120
fulfill our you know uh goal of

231
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
reviewing and putting together a nice

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
program of excellent

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,880
papers for uh crypto this year

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,720
um just uh i think you know as a

235
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
summary statement about uh these

236
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
unfortunate circumstances that we had to

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,239
put a program together and it was just a

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,239
real testament to the icr community

239
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
a lot of people pitched in i have a bit

240
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
more about external reviewers

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
a lot of people pitching with external

242
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
reviews when pc members couldn't uh

243
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,800
you know because of family obligations

244
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,079
or other issues due to the pandemic

245
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,399
finish their reviews

246
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
so uh the peer review process was quite

247
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
standard at high level

248
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
you know we followed the usual process

249
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
of double blind review

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
we targeted having three reviews per

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,200
paper and we we achieved that for almost

252
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
all

253
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,640
uh of the papers um standard conflict of

254
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,518
interest policy etc

255
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,519
we did do a rebuttal phase this year um

256
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
and there's a lot of requests to have

257
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,560
back and forth question answers which i

258
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,079
think actually the new

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,518
software that we used would have

260
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,319
facilitated but that wasn't kind of our

261
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
policy

262
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
something we might consider for for for

263
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
subsequent years

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
uh because of lockdown we did have to do

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,560
a few delays in terms of the

266
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,959
uh the dates when we got back to

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,239
authors uh with the rebuttals and

268
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,359
rebuttal deadlines and paper

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
notification we really

270
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,519
appreciate the patience of the authors

271
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,640
in uh waiting for the that

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,640
uh information um

273
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,079
just by the numbers you know we had 371

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
submissions i have a comparison to some

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,519
other

276
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,640
uh years in a few slides it's uh we're

277
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
still growing

278
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
uh lots of reviews uh many external

279
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,560
reviewers who pitched in

280
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,399
and i think for me uh the acceptance

281
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
rate was 23 but the

282
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,680
summaries this is for me is the number

283
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
of emails that

284
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,479
ended up in my crypto 2020 folder which

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,880
was almost 9 000 so there's quite a bit

286
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,920
of

287
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,120
back-and-forth discussions about um

288
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,160
handling this whole process

289
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
um it's often obligatory to put in

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
something about this is called the

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,839
procrastination

292
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,399
graph in hot crp in our system

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,279
and on the x-axis just shows the days

294
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
before

295
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,279
the number of days before or the number

296
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,040
of days after

297
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,040
a deadline for a review that a reviewer

298
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,279
turned in their reviews and then their

299
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,079
fraction on the y-axis of total

300
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,200
reviews it's obviously further to the

301
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,399
left

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,639
and higher would be better

303
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
but despite all the pandemic lockdowns

304
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
we still had lots of people doing

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,160
reviews early

306
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
in the earlier before deadlines

307
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
and this graph is a little misleading

308
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,079
because it shows a lot of horizontal

309
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
lines below one

310
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,959
which suggests that perhaps the

311
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,320
reviewers can complete all the reviews

312
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
but actually this doesn't count for the

313
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
external reviews that uh

314
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
that reviewers solicited um in fact

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
these external viewers really did a

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
fantastic job of uh helping out uh

317
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
particularly uh

318
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
towards the end of the reviewing process

319
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,399
i can't thank you enough

320
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,680
in terms of the uh average scores the

321
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,639
histogram of the uh overall merit the

322
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
average score

323
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,920
out of five for all of the papers

324
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,959
and so the rejected papers in red and

325
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,719
accepted uh blue

326
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,920
as you would expect most the highly

327
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,480
scored papers the ones that were

328
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,599
accepted

329
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
that there's even at least one that was

330
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
below

331
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,359
average of three and was uh during

332
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
discussion

333
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
decided that this was a paper that

334
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,320
actually despite the numerical score

335
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,519
served to be in so the discussion online

336
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
discussions that we had were really

337
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,560
important

338
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,440
okay now for the quiz portion of the

339
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,079
presentation so we have two word clouds

340
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,040
uh

341
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,040
which are taken from the titles of the

342
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
papers that were accepted or rejected

343
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
and you have to guess which of the two

344
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,560
um

345
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,479
which of these is the accept word cloud

346
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,518
and which is the reject word cloud

347
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
i'm not sure how to see reactions uh i

348
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,959
guess people could uh

349
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,720
vote on the chat you could start a poll

350
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,599
oh we can start a poll okay how do i do

351
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,440
that though bottom of the screen

352
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,720
yeah but i'm in full screen mode on that

353
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
i'll do it for you okay

354
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,760
excuse me i'll just take a sip of my

355
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,760
beer then while you're

356
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,199
taking a quick poll i'll just let you

357
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,560
know that there are more rejections than

358
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,000
acceptances so it's sort of obvious

359
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:17,199
i can't start a poll i don't have the

360
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
right account um

361
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,279
uh what are the uh options that you

362
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
would like me to put on the poll i

363
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,240
believe i have the

364
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,720
ability uh well for

365
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,800
uh you can do left or right i guess to

366
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,040
signify which is the accept category

367
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
okay

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
sorry please stand by because i'm just

369
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
wait

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
it's not going to be obvious if i vote

371
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,199
left that means i what no no hold on

372
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
you gotta get in which one do you think

373
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,160
are the accepts right which one do you

374
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
think are they accept all right

375
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
everyone could turn off their mic for

376
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
one second and just shout out their

377
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,639
answer if that's uh

378
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,880
more appropriate seems very chaotic

379
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
all right let's do it in three two

380
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,610
[Music]

381
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,040
all right thank you so uh

382
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,480
so actually the left is uh the rejects

383
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,079
uh apparently we don't think much of

384
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
security or encryption

385
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
but actually kevin uh leaked the i think

386
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,880
this is not normalized by the

387
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,880
number of papers um okay

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,720
so uh just quickly changes from prior

389
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,199
years this year we used uh hot crp a new

390
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
system uh big thanks go to kevin and

391
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,479
christian and cushion for helping set up

392
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
the software to make the review process

393
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
run

394
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,360
also uh you won't be seeing me next year

395
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,600
we're moving to a cycle having two new

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
program chairs per year

397
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
in terms of uh over the years uh you

398
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
know i think we had just a handful

399
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
fewer submissions this year than last

400
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,439
year uh but

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,560
in the same ballpark and uh you know we

402
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
actually increased the size of the

403
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,800
program

404
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,519
uh by just a handful as well so finally

405
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
just wrap up

406
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
but thanking you know everyone's been

407
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
thanking uh all these people who've been

408
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
doing a great job but we wanted to do it

409
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,800
as well because it really made

410
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,279
our lives much easier so leo uh for uh

411
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
general chairing uh with help from

412
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,040
sophia

413
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,079
uh carmen for the workshop uh antigone

414
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,599
richard martin for

415
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,279
organizing this amazing event which i'm

416
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
taking too much time up from

417
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,480
um chris piker gets a particular shout

418
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,959
out as

419
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,880
a future program chair who also helped

420
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,599
us deal with conflicts for the

421
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
program chairs um kevin and christian as

422
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,399
i mentioned and then

423
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,600
the uh virtual format kevin k and icr

424
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,680
emergency pandemic

425
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,720
ucsb event services and then finally

426
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,160
springer for all their

427
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,720
their help and with that i am uh done

428

that's all

430
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,959
so uh our next speaker is chris

431
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
tina from vladimir so

432
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,319
yeah she's starting to so she's talking

433
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,959
about the post quantum cryptozoo so

434
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,959
please go ahead

435
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:05,760
yeah thank you very much um

436
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:09,439
oh can you see my screen

437
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,640
hello yes yes thank you so much

438
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,319
yeah uh so indeed i'm talking today

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,400
a short announcement about the

440
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,678
post-quantum cryptozoo

441
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,280
so as everyone will have heard nist

442
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,640
recently announced around three

443
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,760
candidates for the

444
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,600
post quantum not very competition and

445
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,799
in this announcement encourage

446
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
submissions

447
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,240
to submit tweaks which means that the

448
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
previous parameter and scheme choices

449
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,200
are still rather volatile

450
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
and multiple scheme versions will be

451
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,200
available and floating around the

452
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,039
internet for each candidate

453
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,039
meanwhile there's also an interest by

454
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,840
industry already so there's there's

455
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,879
virtues

456
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,120
of pqc schemes that are already being

457
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
tested and deployed and this causes

458
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,918
several issues namely

459
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,600
managing all the this whole zoo of

460
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,039
algorithm versions and this

461
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,760
the zoo of key format things

462
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,240
it causes interoperability issues and

463
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,879
and even worse this can cause delays in

464
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,400
integration and adoption

465
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,760
because you have to go back and redo the

466
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
implementations every time

467
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:31,439
so in a in a cooperation with

468
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,320
ibm nxp and utimako we are making

469
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
attempt to

470
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,399
map this post-quantum crypto 2

471
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,520
and we do this with an rc entitled

472
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
tentatively

473
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,480
boost quantum key district key

474
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,760
identification and serialization formats

475
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
and this is an effort to ensure this

476
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,760
interoperability between

477
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,160
all the different zoo animals in the zoo

478
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
in this rc we will focus on the round

479
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,120
three finalists than we

480
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,159
expect to publish in the next few months

481
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,159
and i'm here to to ask people if they

482
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,520
are an expert on any other of the

483
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
algorithms

484
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,000
to volunteer to review or add to this

485
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,000
document we're writing

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,200
which you can do by sending an email to

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,120
pqc nxp.com

488
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
and i'd also like to mention that for

489
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
the alternate

490
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,880
round three candidates a follow-up

491
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,120
rfc is in planning as well

492
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
thank you and uh please email if you're

493
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,080
interested

494
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,720
okay thank you very well so the

495
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,760
next speaker is actually a very special

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
speaker and

497
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,760
we're very pleased to have him here

498
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,760
so it's uh tom berson and he is actually

499
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,480
one of the founding members of

500
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
the icr i think he's been on the icr

501
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
board for

502
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,280
30 years or maybe even more uh i think

503
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,640
he's also done

504
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,840
about every job you can do on the icard

505
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
board and and

506
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,840
generally he always knows everything

507
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,559
about i mean

508
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
yeah it's unbelievable so without

509
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,960
further ado

510
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
tom please take it away

511
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,720
oh you're muted muted

512
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,440
thank you martin um let's talk about the

513
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,879
first crypto the very first and if i was

514
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
in the room i'd say everybody who is at

515
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,240
the first crypto please stand up now so

516
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,679
you can be recognized

517
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
so if you're in your home office and

518
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,440
you're at the first crypto stand up now

519
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,919
and recognize yourself um

520
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
for those who aren't um let's take this

521
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,799
trip down memory lane i think you'll

522
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,879
find some things here

523
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,840
that are interesting i want to add my

524
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,280
thanks my

525
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,360
time to say thanks but i want to say

526
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,840
thanks to everybody who ever

527
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,439
participated in any of the cryptos

528
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,439
whether as a chair

529
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,280
as a committee member as an external

530
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,320
reviewer as an author

531
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,360
as a participant as a consumer of

532
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,639
beer um it wouldn't get to 40 years

533
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,678
without y'all okay

534
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,559
this is the uh this

535
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,799
is the announcement or this is the cover

536
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,720
page of the post proceedings

537
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,760
from crypto 81. it was uh

538
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,640
sponsored by the ieee by the

539
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,000
data data committee and the computer

540
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
communications committee

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,799
of the communications society it was

542
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,280
held here in santa barbara

543
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,360
and a little money came from nsf it was

544
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,320
organized by alan gershow

545
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,559
alan gershow had left i was ahead was at

546
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,039
bell laboratories in uh

547
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,039
in murray hill and left there in 1980

548
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
and came to santa barbara while it bell

549
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
labs he had run

550
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,000
some speaker series and some of the

551
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,520
speakers he found interesting was crypto

552
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,760
were crypto speakers and he thought he

553
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,879
would continue that at santa barbara he

554
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,919
got some people

555
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,720
to help him um there you find a lot of

556
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
usual names

557
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,799
kemmer had been working in computer

558
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,520
security and was also already at santa

559
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,240
barbara

560
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
conheim was at ibm was soon to join

561
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,440
santa barbara

562
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,918
um steve weinstein was a practical guy

563
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,440
at amex who wanted to use des and he had

564
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,799
been at bell labs

565
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
with uh with gershow and he left in a

566
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,080
similar year

567
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
little did gershon know that he was

568
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,559
planting an acorn

569
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,199
that was going to grow into a 40 year

570
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
old

571
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
oak tree you never know when you plant

572
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,320
an acorn

573
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,240
what will happen i'd like everybody to

574
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,039
take a moment and think about how old

575
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,559
you were

576
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,960
in 1981. now i recognize some of

577
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,960
some of you may not have been born yet i

578
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,520
was 35

579
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,799
just to put it in context here whit was

580
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,918
37

581
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:52,158
marty was 36.

582
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,360
ron was 34. audio was 29. len was 36.

583
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,440
we won't say how old shafi was um but we

584
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,760
will say that dan bonet was 11

585
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,679
and he was nearby in isla vista but not

586
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,600
actually at the conference

587
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,280
in 1981 was prince charles married

588
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,480
lady diana spencer and

589
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,158
metallica was formed so it was a

590
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,760
it was a significant year there

591
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,480
now um also in a cryptographic context

592
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,158
it was uh new directions in cryptography

593
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
was five years old if you haven't read

594
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
that paper or haven't read it recently

595
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,960
go back and reread it it had three

596
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,919
paradigm

597
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
uh paradigm changing ideas in it public

598
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
key agreement

599
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
public key cryptography and public key

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,199
digital signatures

601
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,400
uh the suggestion that was in there for

602
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,600
um for a trapdoor one-way function was

603
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,760
knapsacks

604
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,279
they'll come back later rsa was four

605
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,879
years old

606
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,799
des was uh four year was four years old

607
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,400
also the publication of the standard

608
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,840
des as a block cipher educated a

609
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,840
generation of cryptographers

610
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,720
there was essentially no open literature

611
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
in cryptography what they was talking

612
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,159
about

613
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,919
um bit sequences generated by feedback

614
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,120
shift registers and various

615
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,279
non-linear combinations of those

616
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
we connected to our computers at 300

617
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,840
bits per second the 1200 bit per second

618
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,678
modems had just started to arrive and

619
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,199
the first ibm pc

620
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,400
uh was released that year it ran on a

621
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,400
intel 8088 which had 50 000

622
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
transistors on the chip and that was a

623
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,679
lot

624
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,439
so uh if you think about moore's law

625
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,960
you know that there's a doubling of

626
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,279
transistors every

627
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
two years and so in 40 years there's 20

628
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,960
doublings

629
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,559
so we've had two to the 20 doublings of

630
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,279
that and i couldn't help but rewrite

631
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,399
that

632
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,000
to be um to be like this so that's

633
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
what's happening in moore's law despite

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
the fact

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,760
that we and everybody will know

636
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,200
everybody here will know that 2 to the

637
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
28th is about a million

638
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
so despite the fact that we had one

639
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,559
millionth of what we have now

640
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,480
we were able not only to launch a space

641
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,720
shuttle but also to recover it

642
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,679
and that was the first time that ever

643
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
happened

644
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,200
i wish i had pictures to show you of the

645
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,360
conference but i don't here's an

646
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,240
archival picture of the ucsb

647
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,000
beach you can see that the cliffs had

648
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,440
not yet eroded we used to walk down the

649
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
steps and go swimming

650
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,760
on this beach we used to walk on this

651
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,039
beach down to galeta for the uh

652
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,640
um for the beach barbecue we got sat we

653
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,279
got oil on our feet

654
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
uh because of oil leaks and in the

655
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,679
shower rooms in the dorms

656
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,039
was um solvent to take the oil to

657
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,840
dissolve the oil off your feet the

658
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,360
shower rooms

659
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,720
didn't have stalls it was communal

660
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,918
showers which helped a lot to build

661
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,080
community

662
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,600
there were 36 papers in the program

663
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,960
there was a panel there was some rump

664
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
session papers there was a post

665
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,720
proceedings

666
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,439
that were 160 pages i made you a word

667
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
cloud

668
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,360
of the titles of the papers

669
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,360
that were in the first crypto

670
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,760
i'll let you look at that for a moment

671
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
102 people registered i don't know how

672
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
many showed up

673
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,520
about that many they came we came

674
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,240
from nine countries some of which don't

675
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
exist anymore

676
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
we were not cryptographers we came from

677
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
these various

678
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,240
disciplines

679
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,320
and we were not yet a community most of

680
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,320
us didn't know one another

681
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,159
here's a list of the last names of the

682
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
registrants

683
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,799
there's a few i'd like to call out first

684
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
of all bonnet is not dan bonnet because

685
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,720
he was 11.

686
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,158
it's rna ananbane his father

687
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,159
i wonder whether that was significant um

688
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,640
eight of us so far have gone on to win

689
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,159
the am touring award

690
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,000
there are others who i think may do it

691
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,840
but still i think out of 100 people have

692
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,039
eight touring award winners so far is

693
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,039
pretty spectacular

694
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,480
and three of us had explicit

695
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,039
um affiliations with nsa

696
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,320
now this was fraught because people

697
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
weren't sure whether

698
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,760
um whether there was going to be a

699
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,000
problem from nsa about talking about

700
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,360
open cryptography as there had been

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
in the 1977 information theory workshop

702
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,120
it turned out to get all installed in

703
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,159
beer

704
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,479
and in shrimp cocktails and

705
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,880
in chocolate dipped strawberries

706
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,520
traditions that we've continued so

707
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
forty years later this oak tree that uh

708
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,200
this acorn

709
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,199
that gersho uh and others planted has

710
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,559
grown into this oak tree

711
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
under which are series six

712
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
workshops and six conferences in

713
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,320
workshop series

714
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,559
a huge cryptographic bookshelf

715
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,559
students and grand students and maybe

716
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,000
even great grand students at this point

717
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,120
of people who attended and a community

718
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
of cryptographers will look at one

719
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,639
another and smile and say hi so

720
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,279
my call to action for you is that if

721
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
you're holding an acorn in your hand

722
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,320
if you're holding an acorn in your hand

723
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,720
and i'm not sure what to do with it

724
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,240
i would say just go ahead and plant it

725
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,880
and you never know what happens

726
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,840
so thanks all for your attention today

727
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
and for your attendance at the

728
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,320
conference

729
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,918
a lot of these things you can be found

730
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,520
online at iacr.org stroke archive stroke

731
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,440
crypto81

732
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,760
that's it well thank you very much

733

i just have a short announcement um i

745
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,120
have this new textbook foundations of

746
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,360
distributed consensus and blockchains a

747
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,360
very rough draft is available at

748
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,520
distributedconsensus.net

749
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,480
distributedconsensus.net it's very easy

750
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
to remember

751
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,080
i'm looking for feedback and comments if

752
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,559
you are

753
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,799
teaching blockchains or trying to learn

754
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,918
about blockchains this might be

755
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,760
a good resource for you thank you thanks

756
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,200
okay thank you so next up is

757
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:43,039
the fellows one so because we're

758
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,480
turning 40 uh we asked

759
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,039
the fellows of the icr to say a word and

760
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,440
we

761
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,080
collected this or antigone collected

762
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
this

763
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,439
so antigone if you're ready can you

764
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,240
share your screen and

765
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
play the video

766
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:09,840
yes just give me a second

767
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:23,840
okay so we'll continue with the second

768
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:23,840
version of the video for special fellows

769
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,760
the first fifth apartment i've been to

770
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,399
was

771
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,399
1981 the first one

772
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,439
in fact i gave the first stop in the

773
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,559
first session

774
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,320
of the first paper conference i

775
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,240
attended the very first crypto back in

776
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,879
1981 1982.

777
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,039
my first crypto was crypto 81 the first

778
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,480
crypto

779
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:57,360
i attended crypto first at 1984.

780
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,240
this is a historic portal taken at

781
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,399
crypto

782
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,640
84 i attended for the first time

783
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,799
look at the main young cryptographers

784
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,000
including myself

785
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,200
the number of attendees to crypto 84

786
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,320
was about 100. my first crypto was

787
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,159
crypto 85

788
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,399
when i was a lot younger and this shirt

789
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,200
fit better thinking since i got the

790
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,439
email

791
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
about what was my first year at crypto

792
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,240
and i have no idea

793
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,120
it was either 88 or 89.

794
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,519
if anybody knows who had seen me at that

795
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,918
time

796
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,360
in one of those conferences please come

797
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,679
and tell me

798
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,439
my first crypto was 1998 back in the

799
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,960
20th century

800
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,000
my first crypto was 1989. the

801
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,159
first time i attended crypto was in

802
00:31:44,000 --> 00:32:01,840
1989. my first crypto was 1989.

803
00:31:48,159 --> 00:32:01,840
my first crypto was crypto 1990

804
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,480
was back in 1994. i first attended

805
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,000
crypto in 1995

806
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,960
my first crypto was in 1995

807
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,080
where this little piece of memorabilia

808
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
comes from

809
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,918
i think my first crypto is 1995. for the

810
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,640
first time

811
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,200
in 1996.

812
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,399
um the first script i attended was in

813
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,600
1996 which i still remember very warmly

814
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:42,158
and until recently i did have my

815
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,000
krypto 1996 t-shirt not anymore

816
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,519
the first crypto i attended was all the

817
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,519
way back in 1999

818
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,439
first time i pretended crypto i think

819
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,679
was

820
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:59,360
in the year 2000.

821
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
i think i've been to every crypto since

822
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,600
then

823
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,159
since then i've been to almost all the

824
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,639
performances

825
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:13,519
i've only missed two cryptos and

826
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
i came to kryptos ever since so this is

827
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,240
my

828
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,678
37th time i've been to all but maybe two

829
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,880
of them

830
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,880
uh i don't know how many that is but 38

831
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,799
about 38 times

832
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,200
i have attended crypto more than 10

833
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,080
and less than 20 times but i can't

834
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,000
remember exactly

835
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,879
how many i've attended crypto 25 times

836
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,279
now

837
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,640
i've been almost every year since i

838
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,159
think that makes this my 20th crypto

839
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,120
i've obtained about 25 cryptos and i

840
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,000
think i've attended

841
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,840
every crypto since then except one so

842
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
that would mean i've attended crypto 20

843
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,480
times

844
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,719
i believe i attended crypto about 17

845
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,760
times people take one

846
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,440
to be honest i've got no idea how many

847
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,119
times i've attempted crypto

848
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:21,520
don't think it was that much because it

849
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:23,520
always clashes with my son's birthday

850
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,560
do not know how many times i've attended

851
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,119
crypto

852
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,159
but i did not attend quit crypto for

853
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,639
quite some time

854
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,320
after my first time the next time that i

855
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,159
came was a 95

856
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,839
and since then i've tried to come quite

857
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,520
a few times we've attended

858
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,759
all to the five cryptos since then

859
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,440
i've attended about 15 cryptos in the

860
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
last 25 years

861
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,040
all these years i attended crypto five

862
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
times

863
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,719
much less often than i wanted to

864
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,799
probably between 10 and 20 times

865
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,200
and i think i've been attending every

866
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,760
crypto after that except for

867
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,560
two occasions i think i attended crypto

868
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,400
pretty much

869
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,560
every year since then at least 20 times

870
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,560
this

871
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,000
thank you

872
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,480
so now you know how often people have

873
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,240
been when they started

874
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,920
and one of the persons who who has been

875
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,399
quite often is kevin mccurley so

876
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,680
the people who only recently joined our

877
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,640
community might

878
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,319
think that he is the person behind the

879
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,799
infrastructure the tax

880
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,839
stuff and that's true he does that but

881
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,560
in the past he's done

882
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
so much more he was president of the icr

883
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,040
in

884
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,000
from 96 to 98 and

885
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,200
has been active and a really yeah

886
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,520
amazingly active

887
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,720
member of the community uh making sure

888
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,839
the show is running

889
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:59,839
so he has a message uh together with

890
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,839
george benello so kevin please go ahead

891
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,400
so um i thought i'd wear something

892
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,118
really dignified for this

893
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,800
at the suggestion of andy clark so the

894
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
title of this is where's my t-shirt i

895
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,280
chose josh to help me with this because

896
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
i know we're both

897
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
proverbial pack rats and i'll

898
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,200
acknowledge we also have some other

899
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,359
people who helped us with this

900
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,960
so you know in organizing a virtual

901
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,319
conference we thought about giving out

902
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
swag this year

903
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
but you know i was just a little

904
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,759
complicated we had some ideas

905
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,598
like there was this idea about sending a

906
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
mask to everyone but that might be

907
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,359
more useful in the us than other parts

908
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,800
of the world and then we came to our

909
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,319
senses when realized how much it would

910
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
cost but i think we really missed an

911
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,160
opportunity to have some good swag

912
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,839
and i i'm not sure exactly what we can

913
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,759
do next year to top that

914
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
so this being the 40th year of crypto i

915
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,960
thought maybe i'd go through my

916
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,200
my old belongings and see what kind of

917
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,079
swag we had so as far as i could tell in

918
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,118
81 and 82

919
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,000
there was no swag and the first t-shirt

920
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,119
actually was 1983 and it had a nice

921
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,440
little uh

922
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,960
wheel design on it and uh thanks to dick

923
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
kemmer for having sent this to me i

924
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,079
noticed it has a nice uh

925
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,520
what looks like a chocolate stain on it

926
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,440
from strawberries down at the bottom

927
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,800
there

928
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,480
um also uh crypto 84 now i think tom

929
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,800
said he doesn't doesn't actually wear

930
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,160
t-shirts that often in 1984

931
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,240
and so he didn't give out a t-shirt but

932
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,440
he gave a very nice coffee cup thank you

933
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,399
tom for having provided this information

934
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,079
and crypto 85 was my first crypto and i

935
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,079
have at least two pieces of swag from

936
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,760
that one was a crypto 85 shirt

937
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,200
which never fit in the first place and

938
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,040
it's even worse now

939
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,640
and there was also a glass given out

940
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,119
which i found in the archives around the

941
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
house

942
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,400
the margarita is not original though um

943
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,000
crypto 86 had a nice t-shirt i don't

944
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,680
know if you remember but s boxes were a

945
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,119
thing and there were s boxes on this

946
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,839
on this uh shirt in 1986.

947
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,040
in 1987 i thought there was a very fancy

948
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,880
badge that was put out for the

949
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,040
conference that was gordon agnew's

950
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,079
creation and also a nice coffee cup

951
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,320
which i occasionally pull out and use

952
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
now speaking of badges you know there's

953
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
there's a bunch of badges we've had over

954
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,119
the years sometimes you need a

955
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,440
magnifying glass to see what they were

956
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,560
and uh you know the the affiliations

957
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,320
always change

958
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,240
so you might ask why the hell did i save

959
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,320
all these badges you wouldn't imagine i

960
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,078
have a box of like 100 badges from

961
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
conferences i've attended i have no idea

962
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
why i kept all these things

963
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,200
but there were various you know flavors

964
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
they changed the style of badges every

965
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,919
year

966
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,680
i noticed in the eurocrypt era the

967
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,119
badges were completely non-standard

968
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,919
every year they changed them sometimes

969
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,720
they were better than

970
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,960
others and they they weren't keeping up

971
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,560
very well with the badges

972
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
at some point they became readable

973
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,320
because several people dan bernstein

974
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,760
notably and tal complained about the

975
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,520
font was too small to read

976
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
and as we were getting older you had to

977
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,200
bend over you know close to somebody's

978
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,119
chest to be able to read their badge so

979
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,720
i created some software to make the font

980
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,160
bigger still not big enough for dan

981
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,040
bernstein

982
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,879
um now jean-jacques cuiscotter actually

983
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,079
sent me this photo just like in the last

984
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
hour or two

985
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,720
of the swag from crypto 88 this is an

986
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
unusual one this is a visor actually

987
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,160
and this one doesn't work as you get

988
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,160
older because a hat that has no top you

989
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,720
know it doesn't really provide much

990
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,160
protection for your balding head but you

991
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,000
know it was a good idea at the time

992
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,560
i noticed it has a non-standard logo on

993
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
it that's unapproved

994
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,759
now i have this piece of swag that i

995
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,960
came across and i actually have no idea

996
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,160
where this came from it must have been

997
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,079
from a eurocrypt

998
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,240
and it was a very early smart card now

999
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,760
smart cards took off in europe much

1000
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
before the us and i think this is from

1001
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
the 80s the logo is that ancient logo

1002
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,839
but it's in colorized and blue and red

1003
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,078
to make it a little prettier

1004
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,960
there's actually a easter egg in this

1005
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,599
logo if you

1006
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,040
if you know about it now the most

1007
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,240
collectible t-shirt is the one i'm

1008
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,920
actually wearing

1009
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,359
there's a story behind this t-shirt the

1010
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
crypto 89 t-shirt

1011
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,799
uh was a hand airbrushed t-shirt they

1012
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,160
were only given the members of the

1013
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,079
program committee

1014
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,520
and there's a story behind that some

1015
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
people were very angry at me for not

1016
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,880
giving out t-shirts that year

1017
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,640
i was a general chair and the real story

1018
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
is i was too cheap to spend money on

1019
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,920
anyone else

1020
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,760
and so i just gave them to the program

1021
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,359
chairs and

1022
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
it is perhaps interesting that i became

1023
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,480
the icr treasurer in the next year maybe

1024
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,599
they realized they had fiscal

1025
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,440
responsibility going on

1026
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,920
um here's some more t-shirts there's the

1027
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,960
night krypto90 t-shirt the krypto92

1028
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
sheet t-shirt

1029
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,240
i don't know what happened in crypto91

1030
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
sometimes there wasn't a t-shirt and i

1031
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,959
don't really have a record for that

1032
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,960
burkliski who's the general chair maybe

1033
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
we should write to him and ask him

1034
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,119
um the krypto 94 had a classic

1035
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,000
reflection cipher on the front and back

1036
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,520
of the shirt

1037
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,640
it was actually this is not an image

1038
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
that's been flipped over this is the

1039
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,359
back side of the shirt which is just a

1040
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,000
reverse image

1041
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,400
i guess so you could see through it then

1042
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,720
crypto 95 as someone mentioned we had a

1043
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,040
uh

1044
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,118
15 years of crypto and a nice glass

1045
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,839
there i don't have this glass anymore so

1046
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,599
uh

1047
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,119
some i think this is josh's uh

1048
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,480
contribution he still has it which says

1049
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,280
something about how much of a pack rat

1050
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
he is

1051
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,520
15 years seemed like a long time at the

1052
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,599
time and of course there's more t-shirts

1053
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,680
t-shirts t-shirts t-shirts

1054
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,400
there's 96 97 98 krypto 99 we had a

1055
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,799
shirt and a knife to cut it up with uh

1056
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,480
you know

1057
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
shia levy still has this knife so he

1058
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,359
sent me a photograph of it

1059
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,680
i kind of questioned the wisdom of

1060
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,000
giving knives to every cryptographer

1061
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,680
you know but uh it worked out it was

1062
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
actually kind of a poor quality knife

1063
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,040
but that's okay

1064
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,800
we're only up to 2000 and i can hear the

1065
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,480
uh session share growling now because

1066
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
i'm taking so long i'm only halfway

1067
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,160
through

1068
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,760
kryptos so and by the way around this

1069
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,118
time i think my wife was getting annoyed

1070
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,200
because i was bringing home all this

1071
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
these damn t-shirts she never wanted to

1072
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,598
see me wearing them

1073
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,680
she's sitting next to me i must say that

1074
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
she's helped me curate these things over

1075
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,078
the years and and i have to thank her

1076
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,119
for that

1077
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,359
it's good to have a partner in life in

1078
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,599
2002 there was a jacket 2004 there's a

1079
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,078
nice polar fleece i sometimes wear that

1080
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,440
2005 stuart haber realized we're all

1081
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,599
going to go bald eventually so we had a

1082
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,839
nice hat

1083
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,599
and then you know it looks like we drink

1084
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,599
lots of water and coffee because we get

1085
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,680
coffee cups over the years and we got

1086
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,359
also some water bottles at various times

1087
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,440
when we didn't have a t-shirt

1088
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,279
and also we drank wine and one year

1089
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
brian lamacchia gave out a nice bottle

1090
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
of red wine

1091
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,720
backdoor red which he also provided a

1092
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,680
photo of

1093
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,078
and there's more t-shirts of course

1094
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,598
there's

1095
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,200
actually a laser pointer which i still

1096
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,640
have around here someplace but of course

1097
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,399
i can't see it right now

1098
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,598
it's hiding right now but uh the laser

1099
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,599
pointers don't actually work that well

1100
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,640
in a virtual presentation except if you

1101
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,040
shine them on the camera it gives kind

1102
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,160
of a weird effect sort of like a

1103
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,920
light show from the 70s and then

1104
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,920
i have to explain to young people what

1105
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,680
these are we used to actually have to

1106
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,520
take the papers home with us

1107
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,118
and so you know i have a bookshelf

1108
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
behind me if i turn off my virtual

1109
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,880
background showing all these

1110
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,319
lmcs volumes and for a while there they

1111
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,000
were giving them out on usb

1112
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,920
keys of course you know giving handing a

1113
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,680
usb key to a cryptographer to plug into

1114
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
the laptop is sort of like an invitation

1115
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,480
for

1116
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,480
disaster right everybody knows that usb

1117
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,079
is an insecure format and if you look at

1118
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,119
the thickness of the crypto 85

1119
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,400
proceedings that was the whole

1120
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,400
proceedings one book

1121
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,160
now it's three books that would be a lot

1122
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,800
of gross tonnage on airplanes to bring

1123
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,480
all those things home

1124
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,000
and maybe next year you can add

1125
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,480
something else to the stack this is the

1126
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,760
one from crypto 2019 i think we also had

1127
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,520
flip-flops

1128
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
and uh photo credit for this goes to

1129
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,240
brian lamacchia

1130
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,319
but i must say the best thing you can

1131
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,000
take away from crypto is not all the

1132
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,680
t-shirts and that kind of stuff but it's

1133
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,640
the ideas and friends you gather over

1134
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,720
the years

1135
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,560
so thank you very much i hope you have a

1136
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,078
good crypto

1137
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,440
well thank you very much indeed so

1138
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,359
uh for those of you who are

1139
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,520
who want a t-shirt there is actually a

1140
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:46,078
crypto 2020 t-shirt

1141
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:49,599
as you can see which i'm proudly wearing

1142
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,520
um so the design of this

1143
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
will be made available so you'll all

1144
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
have to print it yourself

1145
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
the crypto 2020 t-shirt if you print it

1146
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,520
on something else

1147
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,480
uh then it will not be a t-shirt but it

1148
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,880
will still be

1149
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,920
a crypto 2020 uh memorabilia

1150
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,760
so what we're now going to do is uh not

1151
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,280
have a break but instead we're going to

1152
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,560
play a little game

1153
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,520
uh with our game host bedtime and he

1154
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,560
will introduce

1155
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,680
to you to us uh the panel members

1156
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,279
so petrom please go ahead

1157
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,759
can you see my screen share it should be

1158
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,760
all white

1159
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,200
yes this is a yes how can we tell yes

1160
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,920
yeah okay excellent question

1161
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,759
so i hijacked that so first of all look

1162
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,480
at me if you can see it i also have this

1163
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,720
this wonderful t-shirt i guess martin

1164
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,160
mentioned his copy first so i guess this

1165
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,240
was his application to become a

1166
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,759
treasurer next year

1167
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,680
i understand from kevin this is how it

1168
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,319
works um

1169
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,879
so the first light here is actually not

1170
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,880
on the

the next thing i want to introduce is

1185
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,839
our lovely jeopardy we try to

1186
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,000
uh to have a wonderful jeopardy session

1187
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,078
today as a replacement for the quiz

1188
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,920
uh at jeopardy let me quickly explain

1189
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,960
how this works it's a it's a game played

1190
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,760
by teams

1191
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,440
against each other we have you will see

1192
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,960
in a second this matrix with

1193
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,440
with five times five uh little windows

1194
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,520
which was which have numbers on top here

1195
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,800
and uh different teams can select

1196
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,800
different doors

1197
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,240
uh then they the doors are open they

1198
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,200
will see a term

1199
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,839
and a team then teams can then compete

1200
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,040
with

1201
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,799
quoting formulating a question such that

1202
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,560
this term is the right answer

1203
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,160
if they succeed with this with the right

1204
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,680
answer then they are getting these

1205
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
points

1206
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,799
that's more or less the rules i'll give

1207
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,480
you an example

1208
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,440
if uh somebody picks this c2020 support

1209
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,200
as 100

1210
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,839
then the result could be like this so

1211
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,000
one sees this picture this

1212
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,799
rectangle and the right answer to this

1213
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,240
could be

1214
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,000
who are the sponsors of crypto 2020

1215
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,240
the next thing of course to do is to

1216
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,920
present our team so we have a selection

1217
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,160

1218
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,599

this year

1257

here is the statement

1258
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,160
i see team a first

1259
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:54,319
right can you hear me yes again

1260

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,640
i guess that's correct who is rosario

1262
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,240
gennaro and this

1263
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,879
gives team a 300 points

1264
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,799
fantastic i have to say this is not a

1265
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,480
fair game because i was on the fellows

1266
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,079
committee and i think i may have written

1267
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,480
this caption what do you mean

1268
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:19,680
i wrote it i nominated him and i hold it

1269
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,200
why didn't you press the button i did

1270
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,200
but not fast enough

1271
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,880
well this is not a fake game but not for

1272
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,040
this reason

1273
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,920
please the next question

1274
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,160

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,559
it's another very good question but not

1337
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,319
the right question for this one it was

1338
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,520
not even a question no another question

1339
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,200
can i take jasper again please oh i can

1340
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,759
take my hand down sorry i forgot to take

1341
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,759
my hand down

1342
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,839
will i give you a hint i give you a hint

1343
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,240
so this and this is the same person

1344
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:30,640
[Music]

1345
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,640
and the category is called pairings

1346
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:43,440
rachel i'm purely guessing

1347
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:47,680
who is well

1348
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,680
is it actually the same person

1349
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,439
somewhat the same person yes somewhat

1350
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,440
actually

1351
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,240
huh

1352
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,800
look i'm going to bought this one you

1353
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,200
can open it later it's a very nice one

1354
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,800
so show explain it to us because that

1355
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,839
helps us understand

1356
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:11,839
the category also i open for you the

1357
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,839
100.

1358
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,200
it's called pairing

1359
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,200
i see no ants so here's the hint

1360
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
this i know who are me here bellare and

1361
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,680
phil ragaway

1362
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,880
it's not your turn i see steven hands

1363
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,960
but i was gonna say the same thing

1364
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,960
so what was the question sorry uh who

1365
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,040
are bellary and wrote away

1366
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,440
excellent oops where is it i resolve it

1367
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,359
and so yeah that's a deep fake of mixing

1368
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,680
the two blinding them together into one

1369
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,680
puzzle

1370
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,640
and this gives stephen thanks tom for

1371
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,599
the help

1372
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,520
oh yes so can we now continue with this

1373
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,359
one we opened it already

1374
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:11,119
is steven hands still up i put it down

1375
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:13,520
and there's ore who are the reindeer

1376
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,520
brothers

1377
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,440
that's absolutely correct this is the

1378
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,280
randall brothers

1379
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:25,280
and this and this gives were

1380
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,160
200 points martin how much time do we

1381
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,799
have still left

1382
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,319
i think it's time to uh continue with uh

1383
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,960
the the rest of the

1384
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,240
the rum session all right we will

1385
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,760
continue uh

1386
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:41,759
jeopardy uh during the next break

1387
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,839
effectively um so

1388
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,920
so we have more doors to open but we

1389
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,720
have another two to three sessions

1390
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,400
left i keep the status as it is and

1391
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,640
release this screen share

1392
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,440
if i find where this is done stop

1393
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,160
sharing so

1394
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:01,280
i'll hand over thank you um

1395
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,240
presenting of uh the room session to

1396
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,880
antigone who will continue uh so

1397
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,759
antigone

1398
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,119
please thanks montag so next we have

1399
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,799
louis

1400
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,720
he's going to talk to us about miss

1401
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:17,839
crypto updates 2020

1402
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,839
so can you please start your screen

1403
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:26,000
yes go ahead let's see if i can film in

1404
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,559
for some reason it's not working okay

1405
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,559
can you see me

1406
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,319
yes we can see the slide okay

1407
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,319
okay hello everyone my name is uh luis

1408
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,119
brandau i met nice as a foreign gas

1409
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,200
researcher

1410
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,400
contractor by strativia uh i will be

1411
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,439
presenting in this crypto

1412
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,920
a quick update on three projects

1413
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,160
uh ongoing uh three standardization

1414
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,599
projects on going at nist

1415
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:54,799
those are pqc lwc and

1416
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,240
tc and let's see what those

1417
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,440
acronyms stand for so pqc is the

1418
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,118
post-quantum

1419
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,319
cryptography competition within quotes

1420
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,319
uh ongoing at nist uh it has the goal of

1421
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,319
standardizing some

1422
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,359
primitives that remain safe even in the

1423
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,920
presence

1424
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,359
of quantum computers and the primitives

1425
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,119
of interest are basically digital

1426
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,119
signatures on one hand

1427
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,319
and then on the other hand we have uh

1428
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,440
public key encryption

1429
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:26,480
which it's very related to in

1430
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,280
key encapsulation methods

1431
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,640
so the round two has ended in july 22nd

1432
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,160
2020

1433
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,240
uh so last month and currently there are

1434
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,640
15 submissions that have advanced to

1435
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,118
round number three and these are divided

1436
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,480
into

1437
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:48,160
finalists and alternates

1438
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:52,240
the final lists are those cases where

1439
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:55,200
the pqc team does expect to have

1440
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,160
candidates accepted and standardized and

1441
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,960
the alternates

1442
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:02,160
are choices where the team the pqc team

1443
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,880
finds that there is interest in

1444
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,960
continuing to look at them

1445
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,079
in a more extended period not

1446
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,960
necessarily standardized

1447
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,920
but the time will will say so the

1448
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,280
finalists

1449
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,839
for signatures there are three

1450
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,240
candidates for pke

1451
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,880
there are uh three four candidates as

1452
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,279
well

1453
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,960
and you can see them in the slides and

1454
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,119
then for the alternates

1455
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,000
uh there's also alternates for each of

1456
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,520
the types of

1457
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,160
primitives for signatures there are

1458
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:34,799
three of them and for pke

1459
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,118
kems there are uh five of them

1460
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,240
by the way i am not part of the pqc team

1461
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,119
i am presenting on

1462
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,399
on their behalf this slide uh the

1463
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,040
specification encodes

1464
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,400
uh will be available online in this uh

1465
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,920
website nis.gov slash pq crypto

1466
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,359
and if you haven't done so but are

1467
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,880
interested in the topic please sign up

1468
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,839
for announcements and discussion

1469
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,640
on the pqc forum and here's a timeline

1470
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,040
since

1471
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,400
where submission started since 2017

1472
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,599
there have been several rounds in the

1473
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,280
analysis

1474
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:07,200
and maybe around 20 22

1475
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,160
there will be draft standards available

1476
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,799
that's uh that's an intention

1477
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,440
okay then we have the lightweight uh

1478
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,000
crypto

1479
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,200
cryptography standardization uh

1480
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,880
lightweight cryptography

1481
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,319
you have a timeline here we're not going

1482
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,000
to go through

1483
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:25,599
through uh all of them um

1484
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,440
but essentially you can consider that

1485
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,240
yet uh lightweight cryptography

1486
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,599
standardization

1487
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,959
is somewhat similar to the case of bqc

1488
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:39,440
the project aims to identify

1489
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,440
aead schemes and optional hashing

1490
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,040
functionality suitable for constrained

1491
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,440
environments

1492
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,200
nist has received 57 candidates

1493
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,720
originally for the process

1494
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:53,439
and the 32 second rounds candidates were

1495
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,680
announced in august of 2019

1496
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,079
and as the next steps nist is planning

1497
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,118
to host a virtual workshop in october

1498
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,440
october 19-21 of this year the

1499
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,440
submissions are due by september 14th

1500
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,119
and nist is planning to select around

1501
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,599
eight finalists to move

1502
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,240
to the final round in in december also

1503
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,160
you have

1504
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,479
if you haven't done so consider signing

1505
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,960
up for the for the discussion forum

1506
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,720
of lightweight uh and then we have the

1507
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,720
threshold cryptography project which is

1508
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,200
in a much earlier stage

1509
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,799
the goal is to identify to to move

1510
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,399
towards possible standardization of

1511
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,319
threshold schemes for

1512
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,920
key base cryptographic primitives so we

1513
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,759
are initially interested in

1514
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,920
in things like signatures public

1515
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,319
encryption uh

1516
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,599
encryption key generation where they are

1517
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:41,200
performed in a

1518
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,440
in a threshold manner we have a roadmap

1519
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,279
towards criteria for evaluation of these

1520
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,480
schemes which is out since

1521
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
july this splits the the project in two

1522
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,040
tracks

1523
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,599
multi-party and single device the single

1524
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:56,558
multi-part is what we use to

1525
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,000
secure multi-part computation uh in in

1526
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,520
this case to perform a cryptographic

1527
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,640
primitive the single device is the case

1528
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,720
where you have

1529
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,920
a threshold designed within a particular

1530
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,359
single device

1531
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,319
uh we will have a workshop in november

1532
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,480
november 4th

1533
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,599
and 6th and we are really interested in

1534
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,720
receiving community

1535
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,680
uh from from the community about

1536
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,558
criteria

1537
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,919
and the submission page is already uh

1538
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,319
out

1539
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,480
uh and the submission deadline is

1540
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,640
september 30th

1541
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,480
sign up for discussion and announcements

1542
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,160
also at our forum

1543
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,799
and thank you very much and you can find

1544
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,680
more information at the crypto

1545
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,280
group website thank you very much for

1546
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,359
your attention

1547
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,480
thanks a lot you're welcome

1548
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,160
so next we have christian

1549
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,480
so christian is gonna tell us about the

1550
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,720
winners of round one of the low mc

1551
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,280
picnic crypto analysis competition

1552
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,520
and the start of round two so please

1553
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,520
share your screen

1554
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,559
all right hi everyone can you can you

1555
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,160
see my slides

1556
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,720
yeah great so yeah this is just a short

1557
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,520
update on

1558
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,240
our ongoing lmc slash picnic captain

1559
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,240
isis competition

1560
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,680
so what is lmz very briefly it's a

1561
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,240
special purpose cryptographic

1562
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,558
cipher or permutation the fj is that it

1563
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,240
has a very few and gates

1564
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,079
well it's picnic so picnic is a

1565
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,078
signature scheme based on the so-called

1566
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,280
apc in the head paradigm

1567
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,520
as you just have heard i've heard

1568
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,400
it's advanced into the third round of

1569
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,680
the

1570
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,319
pqc selection process of mist and one of

1571
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,160
the features

1572
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,839
of picnic is that it's only hardn's

1573
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,720
assumption is that it's

1574
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,680
relying on the security of that special

1575
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,959
purpose

1576
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,839
cryptographic primitive in a very

1577
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,839
constrained setting

1578
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,310
so what are we doing and why are we

1579
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,428
doing this

1580
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:50,429
[Music]

1581
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,960
lmc has a bunch of nice clips analysis

1582
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,799
results

1583
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,160
already in the last five years or so

1584
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,079
still compared to a yes

1585
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,160
in the last 25 years or was it compared

1586
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:05,440
to another global standard

1587
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,879
cat check this free from 10 or 12 years

1588
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:12,480
ago it doesn't have as much

1589
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,200
good analysis and hence not as much

1590
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,640
confidence yet and also the attacker

1591
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,319
setting is very special because

1592
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,558
in this picnic construction we only

1593
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,400
allow for a singly plaintext separate

1594
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,880
explainer

1595
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,559
for front advisory and uh to focus

1596
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,760
crypto analytic attention what we do is

1597
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,200
to

1598
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:33,520
grab a significant amount of damage

1599
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,598
the euros from from microsoft for

1600
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,799
example plus

1601
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,960
donation from iov42

1602
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,480
and post this challenge so this is

1603
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,559
ongoing now for a while

1604
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,400
and the questions the challenges that we

1605
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,400
ask are how fast can you break

1606
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,839
a certain number of rounds in certain

1607
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,079
settings

1608
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,799
so this deadline has passed last week

1609
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,440
and we have a winner of the first round

1610
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,640
this is a team consisting of super deep

1611
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,280
pantik

1612
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,920
akashaya pakoti and serge rodney from

1613
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,440
epfl

1614
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:07,760
and the tilted rack from bosch they

1615
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,480
described in their paper a two round

1616
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,799
attack

1617
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,160
and another attack with the lowest 10

1618
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:15,599
complexities and henza

1619
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:17,839
the odin congratulations

1620
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,960
to them all the details in the paper

1621
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:22,240
will be online

1622
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:25,280
tomorrow on that website

1623
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,879
so with that i'm describing

1624
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:33,280
the second round challenge

1625
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:36,160
which is again of the same style we have

1626
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,640
this remaining amount of the sponsoring

1627
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,680
still

1628
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,200
to distribute in this certain categories

1629
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,038
all of that is available on the website

1630
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,279
i will not go into

1631
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,559
the details more what is important here

1632
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,599
is a new deadline namely

1633
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:52,400
the week before azure crypt

1634
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,119
um yeah that's it the email address the

1635
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,880
website is

1636
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,000
is up here i'm looking forward to your

1637
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,000
submissions thank you

1638
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,279
thanks a lot christian

1639
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,279
so next uh i have the feeling that evo

1640
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,839
is missing

1641
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,440
so yes i'm here oh you're here cool we

1642
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,119
couldn't find you at the chat

1643
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,039
so before you start i want to announce

1644
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,880
as well that we are going to have an

1645
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,319
award for the best presentation and you

1646
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,760
can vote for it

1647
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:24,240
we will paste the link on the chat

1648
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,559
i think kevin can paste the link

1649
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,759
and actually the link will be on the

1650
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,920
rump session pro

1651
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:34,480
on the rump session paper on the website

1652
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,480
okay great

1653
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:42,240
so evo yes go ahead go ahead

1654
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,119
so uh what i wanted to talk about uh

1655
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,359
today

1656
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,400
is that we have 40 years advancing

1657
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,160
cryptology

1658
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,640
and the question is how will history

1659
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,960
judge us

1660
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,879
so today most of the research in crypto

1661
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,920
is what i would call assumption

1662
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,839
based and so from history we are

1663
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,039
actually not the first

1664
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:05,440
to be assumption based science

1665
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,559
and so if you look at other uh sciences

1666
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,520
that came before

1667
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,119
astrology assumed that the earth was in

1668
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,720
the center of the universe we know what

1669
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,160
happened to that and we had to wait

1670
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,078
actually centuries

1671
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,680
until copernicus challenged that

1672
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,640
assumption

1673
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,879
so alchemists actually for much longer

1674
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,240
assumed that there were five elements

1675
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,240
and they're different from the east to

1676
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,399
the west but uh so if you look in china

1677
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,799
they use different ones but in the west

1678
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,760
there were basically five uh the

1679
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,880
elements

1680
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,160
earth water air fire and aristotle

1681
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,920
actually added ether so basically you

1682
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,960
have to be very careful if you use

1683
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,760
assumptions

1684
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,960
so the question is how did we challenge

1685
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,960
our assumptions

1686
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,799
and crypto analysis actually challenges

1687
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,839
our assumptions

1688
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:54,160
so at crypto in the 1980s i checked and

1689
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,440
actually there were 33 to 48 percent of

1690
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,319
the papers

1691
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,760
where on crypto analysis and that's if

1692
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,680
you look at 1980 that's

1693
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,039
a little bit after the book by gary and

1694
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,919
johnstone came out there's a nice

1695
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,720
cartoon there

1696
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,720
which i actually adopted the text of so

1697
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,520
this guy says

1698
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,118
i can't find an efficient attack but

1699
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,920
neither can all these famous

1700
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,240
uh cryptanalysts okay so that's how it

1701
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,960
used to be

1702
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,520
so now how to prepare for the future oh

1703
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,760
we've

1704
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,720
definitely won't post quantum security

1705
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,920
and nobody is

1706
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,160
challenging that okay and this despite

1707
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,359
that after 20 years of research

1708
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,520
sinch shores algorithm in 1994

1709
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:36,400
we still do not have a large quantum

1710
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,559
computer

1711
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,799
so we should really wonder whether this

1712
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:44,319
is just science fiction

1713
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:46,319
as far as we know so how do we challenge

1714
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,319
our assumptions today

1715
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,680
today we have significantly less papers

1716
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,520
on crypto analysis

1717
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,118
this year we have two sessions which is

1718
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,799
great but that hasn't been always the

1719
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,480
case in the last years for example trip

1720
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,480
to 2012

1721
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,000
only six percent of the papers were on

1722
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,559
crypto analysis

1723
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,720
and actually worse we no longer follow a

1724
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,960
gary johnson-like approach but what do

1725
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:09,598
we follow instead

1726
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,400
we just trust nist that's the new

1727
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,680
approach

1728
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,359
to challenging our assumptions and we

1729
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,519
don't try to break rsa

1730
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:19,278
anymore even though rsa is still heavily

1731
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,480
used there are almost no papers

1732
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,480
there's almost no progress so

1733
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,839
what happened to all the cryptanalysts

1734
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,599
that used to be there

1735
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,519
as we see here we had a lot of

1736
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,359
cryptanalysts we still have some

1737
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,520
cryptanalysts but

1738
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,799
as you saw from the percentages their

1739
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,159
impact is less

1740
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,319
so where did some of the famous

1741
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:41,839
cryptalists go

1742
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:44,239
hendrik lenstra since he stopped working

1743
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,960
on factoring in 1990 on a classical

1744
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,799
computer

1745
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,679
there has been no fundamental progress

1746
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:52,319
on factoring since then

1747
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,158
so ernie brickell who was very active on

1748
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,239
breaking several knapsack schemes he

1749
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,318
retired

1750
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,000
adi shamir used to be very active but

1751
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,239
now has been sidetracked by

1752
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,920
side channels he likes to do works

1753
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,000
heavily on side channels

1754
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,560
but sideshows is not real crypto

1755
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,359
analysis because if you are

1756
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:14,319
evosping the internet then you basically

1757
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,159
side channels are not that useful

1758
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,679
so don coppersmith used to be very

1759
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,519
active and probably still

1760
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,679
is very active but what happened to him

1761
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,719
we don't know it's all classified

1762
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,239
since he moved to ida some of you may

1763
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:28,158
not know jim reeves

1764
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,519
but he also was quite active in crypto

1765
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,080
analysis

1766
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,359
and he also moved to ida so what is he

1767
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,040
doing nowadays also that's classified

1768
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,359
and some people as for example under

1769
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,960
your lisco they switched areas so andrew

1770
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,520
you switch to economic aspects of

1771
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,040
security

1772
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,120
so i'm not saying that we don't do

1773
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,120
anything on cryptanals there is some

1774
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,479
recent progress on crypto analysis for

1775
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,000
example if you look at substantial

1776
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,678
progress has been made on breaking

1777
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,840
several hash functions as md4

1778
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,600
and d5 and xiaowell breaking this

1779
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,520
logarithm over finite fields

1780
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,040
of characteristic 2 a lot of progress

1781
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,040
has been made on that and also breaking

1782
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,360
several multi-linear maps

1783
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,199
also a lot of progress has been done but

1784
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,400
if you look at for example rsa which is

1785
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:12,000
still heavily used

1786
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,400
or for example three people des or aes

1787
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,080
not that much and so we could actually

1788
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,400
wonder whether zima was right

1789
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,080
when he stated that heart problems are

1790
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,879
the problems that nobody works on

1791
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,040
which is really bad for our area don't

1792
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,000
forget that crypto is no longer

1793
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,560
what it was in 1981 as tom person said

1794
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,960
when we only had 300 bit per second

1795
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,719
uh crypto is used today everywhere and

1796
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,560
it has become very important and we

1797
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,360
should make sure that our system that we

1798
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,159
use

1799
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,239
actually have decent security and if we

1800
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,799
don't we end up with this situation

1801
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,239
okay with so little research on cryptons

1802
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,480
we do not know

1803
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:49,839
whether we're standing on thin ice some

1804
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,879
of the people who are attending actually

1805
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,679
from canada

1806
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,040
and if in the car it gets that cold then

1807
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,600
in the winter you can actually

1808
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,080
drive a truck over a lake that's

1809
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
completely

1810
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,199
frozen so that's thick eyes but we don't

1811
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,280
know

1812
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,320
how thick our ice is and they will be

1813
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:08,880
astin as in this picture

1814
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,000
so how would i conclude i think it's too

1815
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,719
early to celebrate

1816
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,120
it took 300 years to break visionaire

1817
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,159
cypher it's way too early to celebrate

1818
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,840
after 40 years

1819
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,519
if we want to be judged by history as

1820
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,280
naive

1821
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,120
so if we don't want to be judged by

1822
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,719
history as naive we should work

1823
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,960
much higher to our breaking crypto

1824
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,120
systems and i think that icr should have

1825
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,440
more pc shares in the area

1826
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,040
required fifty percent of the best paper

1827
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,759
awards go

1828
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,120
to papers on crypto analysis and course

1829
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,159
workshops and summer schools on the

1830
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,719
topic

1831
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:43,120
and correct funding agencies to increase

1832
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:45,760
uh unclassified funding in the area

1833
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,480
and i know that moti at catacrypt

1834
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,120
mentioned

1835
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,639
the national science foundation uh not

1836
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,640
or almost not running

1837
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,239
uh conventional cryptography research on

1838
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,679
conventional cryptography in the united

1839
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,599
states so in total

1840
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,440
in unclassified funding in the area in

1841
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,600
the u.s it's actually very bad

1842
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,719
and so i actually complained and sent an

1843
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,000
email about that

1844
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,320
to nist so i think that all phd students

1845
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,320
should

1846
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,000
read a little bit more about the history

1847
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,199
of crypto analysis and here you find

1848
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,440
some surveys that were done

1849
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,120
by brickell and disco which i think

1850
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,639
should be required reading for phd

1851
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,559
students there are two versions

1852
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,320
and also i put two versions of calm the

1853
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,400
one is a 700 page book

1854
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,840
and the other one is a few pages it's a

1855
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,000
scientific american

1856
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,080
so if you don't want to read every day

1857
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,120
while you do your phd as i was doing

1858
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,640
two pages out of khan's book every

1859
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,159
evening before you go to sleep

1860
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,679
then you read the scientific american

1861
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,679
one finally

1862
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,120
for those of you are interested in my

1863
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,239
email uh to

1864
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,640
nist this is a copy that i

1865
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,839
basically left in appendix and you can

1866
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:51,600
all read that

1867
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:54,239
afterwards thank you for your attention

1868
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,239
thank you evil

1869
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,120
they're going to sell you i don't know

1870
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,519
how i can get out the share or stop

1871
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,679
share

1872
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:07,520
okay that's it thank you

1873

so now we move to moti so morty is going

1874
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,159
to tell us about three randomizable

1875
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:19,839
rcca security receiver anonymous and

1876
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:19,839
generic constructions

1877
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,679
trying to share one second yeah whenever

1878
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,679
you are ready

1879
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,000

1892
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,560
no no you're still not sharing the

1893
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,679
screen but um

1894
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:20,080

your merchandise bedroom well

1897
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:32,400
that is my crypto hobby poppy

1898
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,400
ooh your crypto hoppy poppy uh-huh

1899
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,000
where did you get that

1900
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,320
your crypto hoppy puppy crypto it was in

1901
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,679
the bag in the backpack that i got on

1902
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,759

1903
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,760
oh that's very good

1904
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,480
so well moti is still trying to set up i

1905
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,159
have a question for your

1906
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:57,519
veteran so are you suffering from

1907
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,519
a covet haircut

1908
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:10,159
my goodness no but better i tried to

1909
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:10,159
i tried to imitate multi second actually

1910
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,640
because you know last year uh i i also

1911
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:20,800
chaired the room session um and then

1912
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,920
after the rope session at the barbecue

1913
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,600
uh daniela he

1914
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,120
he said oh i was quite he was quite

1915
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,520
pleased with the rum session he asked me

1916
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,320
oh

1917
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,239
maybe you can do it again next year um

1918
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,080
and it so happened that that year just

1919
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:33,040
before crypto i went to the hairdresser

1920
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,640
and i thought oh

1921
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,800
then i need to stop going to the

1922
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,800
hairdresser just so

1923
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,280
when crypto comes around in a year of

1924
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,679
time i have a proper covet haircut

1925
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,000
so i haven't been to the hairdresser

1926
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,640
since last year's crypto

1927
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,679
just that's the impression you make

1928
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,760
indeed

1929
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,040
i know it's it's it's the sacrifices you

1930
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,159
make it's the the

1931
01:16:53,040 --> 01:17:00,080
yeah moti how are things going there

1932
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:01,839
uh one second so probably you need to

1933
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,679
sell from the app not from the browser

1934
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,840
are you using browser

1935
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,600
i cannot share from the app because of

1936
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,760
companies policy

1937
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,760
but

1938
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:17,840
let me

1939
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,639
i will fix my screen okay great thank

1940
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,560
you

1941
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:36,000
so next we have uh alison and richard

1942
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:39,440
are you ready alison yep

1943
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,840
perfect so we're gonna have crypto at

1944
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,639
home now

1945
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:47,520

leakage resilient differentially private

1951
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,560
contact tracing works

1952
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,760
as long as users value privacy over

1953
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:13,640

i don't care why they always have decaf

1961
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,280
i mean if you're gonna drink crappy

1962
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,640
coffee you're gonna at least have

1963
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,840
caffeine right

1964
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,840
i like decaf

1965
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,199
i gotta go

those have to last for everyone

and that's how round optimal cca secured

1971
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:06,560
neural nets work

1972
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:07,360
any questions so i i have a two-part

1973
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,280
question

1974
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,360
the first part's more of a comment have

1975
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,110
you thought about using a negative one

not even close way too good

1983
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:50,110
and that's how tightly secure lwe based

1984
01:19:45,040 --> 01:20:00,880
aggregate signatures work

[Music]

1986
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,840
so what's next want to make something

1987
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,839
with the rom session

1988
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:33,840

1989
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:33,839

1991
01:20:45,040 --> 01:21:04,320
and that's how decentralized

1992
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,320
well it was fantastic thanks a lot

1993
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,678
i remind you you can still vote for your

1994
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,679
favorite presentation

1995
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,719
so let's move on to the next one uh

1996
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,840
so modi we will try at the end before

1997
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,960
the jeopardy

1998
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,800
uh so let's go to pierre

1999
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,840
he's gonna tell us about topology hiding

2000
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:30,400
computation for minimal assumptions

2001
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:34,080
yes okay

2002
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,080
yeah whenever you're ready you can start

2003
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,679
so uh can you also slides

2004
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,840
yes

2005
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,280
so hello everyone i'm very happy to be

2006
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,960
here to tease

2007
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:56,960
some very cool very very sexy new

2008
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,480
results in the field of topologizing

2009
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,239
computation

2010
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,519
uh so as you can see this is joint work

2011
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,839
with about half the community

2012
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,920
so for formal citation please use uh

2013
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,760
babococo mmo

2014
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,520
so i'll start with like just defining

2015
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,320
what apologizing computation is then we

2016
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,600
can have a look at

2017
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,000
what the results look like uh sorry uh

2018
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,199
just

2019
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,480
relevant definitions yeah good uh

2020
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:23,120
so topology computation is a form of mpc

2021
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,000
multiparty computation where the parties

2022
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,679
the players are

2023
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,960
placed at the nodes of some

2024
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,040
communication graph and they're only

2025
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,040
allowed to talk with their neighbours

2026
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,480
where topology hiding kicks in is that

2027
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,480
they only know

2028
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,678
some local view of the network i'll

2029
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,519
define this in a minute

2030
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,040
and by the end of the computation they

2031
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,199
should not have learned anything more

2032
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,880
about the structure of the graph

2033
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:44,799
so what's a local view let's say for

2034
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,159
party number 10 okay he knows his

2035
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,120
neighbors but not how the

2036
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:50,480
other parties are communicating in fact

2037
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,480
he doesn't even need to know who the

2038
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:55,678
other players in the competition are

2039
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,360
or indeed how many players they are good

2040
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,760
so most what have been on trying to

2041
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,880
understand how to realize this uh

2042
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,280
notion under the like against as

2043
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,360
strong an adversary as possible whereas

2044
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,880
we try to understand what the core

2045
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,759
difficulty about realizing this

2046
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,120
is so we take the most minimal setting

2047
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,679
and we try to understand

2048
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,519
what kind of cryptographic assumptions

2049
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,239
are required to agreement ots that sort

2050
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,840
of thing

2051
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,280
so the first two points are are

2052
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,679
straightforward we're

2053
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,280
only doing broad seminars broadcast but

2054
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,880
restrictive graph classes

2055
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,199
means that before the start of the

2056
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,800
protocol uh the players

2057
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,879
know something about the graph for

2058
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,199
instance it's uh it's it's a path there

2059
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,040
are 12 players that sort of thing

2060
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,320
so note that this would be trivial if

2061
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,040
you didn't care about hot hiding's a

2062
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,559
topology

2063
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,880
semi on this broadcast just sends a bit

2064
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,120
through the graph but it becomes

2065
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:48,960
as we show here very rich when you do

2066
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:50,719
care about heising topology

2067
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,719
so now it's time for the quiz i'm going

2068
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,639
to give you a couple of graph classes

2069
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,760
free in fact and you're going to try and

2070
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,600
uh into it well

2071
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,560
i mean if you want to of course intuit

2072
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,400
what kind of assumption is required

2073
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,560
so the first one we call the triangle

2074
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,960
you have three players as you can see

2075
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,560
uh lala in yellow is very acutely

2076
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,320
holding the broadcast bit

2077
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,800
and to make this more thematic let's

2078
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,199
just say it's a broadcast strawberry

2079
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,360
so what does the graph look like well

2080
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:20,960
it's as the graph class is comprised of

2081
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,559
these three graphs um also

2082
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,480
do note that these are in fact three

2083
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,600
different graphs not like some giant

2084
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:29,360
giant uh teletubbies demonic ritual as

2085
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,120
it does look like

2086
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,719
three different guts so this is actually

2087
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,599
a very nice class to start with because

2088
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:35,280
if you have a look

2089
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,639
if you try if you take it and try and

2090
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,800
play around with it

2091
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,560
like okay the broadcaster sends a bit to

2092
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,800
her neighbors and that sort of thing

2093
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,239
you'll very quickly uh realize why this

2094
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,520
is hard

2095
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:49,040
and in fact achieving semi-honest

2096
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,360
broadcast on this class

2097
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,440
requires key agreement and is in fact

2098
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,000
possible given the agreement

2099
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,519
the second class this time we do not

2100
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
have a fixed number of players just a

2101
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,080
variable

2102
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
number of ones let's uh and let's uh

2103
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,080
instantiate this with with teletubbies

2104
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,440
again uh

2105
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:11,840
now if you if you try

2106
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,839
you should be able to come up with an

2107
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:18,639
information theoretic protocol

2108
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,960
which is nice so this tells us that uh

2109
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:22,159
it sounds somewhat similar to before

2110
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,560
like in the sense that

2111
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,000
uh you do not know how your neighbors

2112
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,840
are talking but it's not like

2113
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,360
it's not the core difficulty of

2114
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,199
understanding why

2115
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,719
uh topology hiding broadcast is

2116
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,239
difficult or not

2117
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,239
now for the third class i'm not actually

2118
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,799
going to go into details it's just like

2119
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,320
a par

2120
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,000
you do not know if it's two parts on the

2121
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,120
line or three parts on the line

2122
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,360
because that would require some

2123
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:45,519
additional definitions but just know

2124
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,679
that it will require ot

2125
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,280
and so if i lost anyone this is the time

2126
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:50,880
to wake up because this is like there's

2127
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,000
a nice result

2128
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,120
so as you can see so the main

2129
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,040
takeaway is give me a graph class and

2130
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,040
i'll be able to tell you immediately

2131
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,320
what kind of assumption is required and

2132
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,280
as you can see there's a very nice

2133
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,599
parallel

2134
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,840
between what between the crypto world

2135
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,400
and the graph fairy

2136
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,840
uh like for instance uh an information

2137
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,559
theoretic protocol for

2138
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,280
uh topology hiding broadcast exists if

2139
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,560
and only if

2140
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,880
all graphs in the class are too

2141
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,400
connected and same for key agreement and

2142
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,960
ot

2143
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,480
uh now uh i'd just like to finish on the

2144
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,639
thing on the last point

2145
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,159
so as i mentioned uh the existence of a

2146
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,880
keyground protocol

2147
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:32,638
is equivalent to that of a topology

2148
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,480
hiding broadcast unlike the first class

2149
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,080
i introduced the triangles like the

2150
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:39,759
demonic one

2151
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,639
uh and so uh so since this is equivalent

2152
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,040
to key agreement

2153
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,159
we'd like to make a proposal for nist to

2154
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,159
actually replace

2155
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,159
the standard implementation for kilgren

2156
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,839
with this new notion which sounds very

2157
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,759
reasonable and very

2158
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,600
well perhaps not so efficient but at

2159
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,320
least it's more fun

2160
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,320
thank you very much

2161
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:07,199
thanks a lot for the nice talk so then

2162
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,199
let's move on to

2163
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,759
to benjamin benjamin lee please share

2164
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,280
your screen

2165
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,960
he's gonna tell us about protocol x-key

2166
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,599
my friends are not very good a

2167
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,320
cryptographic multi-party computation

2168
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,320
party game

2169
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,760
hello

2170
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,759
am i sharing my screen

2171
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,520
i don't know oh select a window

2172
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,480
yes you're set now am i sharing my

2173
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,480
screen

2174
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:52,638
yes okay so

2175
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,638
uh

2176
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,400
protocol excuse me wrong language

2177
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:04,159
well i mean good that i noticed that

2178
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,199
before pronouncing the

2179
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:10,080
following because a cryptographic

2180
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:13,040
multi-party computation party game

2181
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:15,040
is certainly very hard to pronounce in

2182
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,080
french

2183
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,080
so um

2184
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,639
some of you who use twitter or followed

2185
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,360
the zulip during eurocrypt 2020 which

2186
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,679
was the

2187
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,480
first online conference i attended this

2188
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,840
year

2189
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:34,959
first online conference i intended ever

2190
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,760
i might have seen this protocol that i

2191
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,000
display

2192
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:40,000
in the background and for all the others

2193
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:48,800
some prior work so disappeared

2194
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:51,040
during not at during eurocrypt 2020

2195
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,040
and uh i published this following tweet

2196
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,440
this is a protocol other cryptographers

2197
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,040
and me just developed during a eurocrypt

2198
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,080
session

2199
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:03,280
session means a watch party

2200
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,280
big blue button session

2201
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,120
we believe it is secure against an

2202
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,679
uninterested adversary

2203
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,559
this was something another person in our

2204
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,800
session uh

2205
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,560
proposed to call this at a later point

2206
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,199
we might disclose the game we played to

2207
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:19,440
achieve this hashtag eurocrypt 2020 and

2208
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:22,879
then you see a screenshot of

2209
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:24,480
like some weird protocol in with a lot

2210
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,679
of colors

2211
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,199
um so

2212
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,239
i posted this on twitter and then

2213
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:35,839
matthew green retweeted it

2214
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:37,678
and 18 000 people saw this tweet

2215
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,199
and i got really intimidated by that

2216
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,880
this is the tweet it was

2217
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:45,280
like most seen of my tweets

2218
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,719
so i was so intimidated i just liked all

2219
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,000
the replies

2220
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,280
um to this tweet i didn't reply anything

2221
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,679
myself

2222
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,800
that is publicly computable on flow

2223
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,440
three

2224
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:00,239
yeah that's right and also on on

2225
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:02,559
protocol flow two there is g to the ac

2226
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:04,559
i mean why would you do that that's

2227
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:08,080
that's like the shared secret

2228
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:12,320
like the person that did this they uh

2229
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:14,960
they rightfully invoke gdpr to

2230
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:16,559
to like say please don't link me to this

2231
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:20,000
tweet

2232
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:22,880
so anyway so so what is this this is

2233
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,080
collaboratively designing a protocol

2234
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,520
everyone

2235
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:28,480
puts a message one by one but only

2236
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,840
seeing

2237
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:35,839
the previous message not the entire

2238
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,840
protocol

2239
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,480
so maybe you know the game uh

2240
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,080
cadaver exqui nobody will know that this

2241
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,280
is called like this the french call it

2242
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,760
like this because some french

2243
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,199
surrealists called it like this it works

2244
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,679
like this it's like supposed to be a

2245
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:54,960
children's game at a birthday party

2246
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:58,159
you uh give everyone a paper

2247
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:01,440
everyone starts to draw a head head

2248
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:03,120
or a hat whatever and then

2249
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:07,120
folds the paper gives it to the next

2250
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:09,040
person next person draws the upper body

2251
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,960
folds it gives to next person next

2252
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,960
person uh draws the the

2253
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,239
the feet or whatever and at the end is

2254
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,159
very

2255
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:19,759
funny picture so we did the same during

2256
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:22,799
eurocrypt 2020

2257
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:25,679
with the protocol so this was uh

2258
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,480
just a big blue button white board with

2259
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,880
manually copying around moves

2260
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,959
this was i mean i was the game master

2261
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,159
this was very stressful

2262
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,840
and um so now for furthest birthday of

2263
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:41,879
crypto

2264
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:45,840
now this is a browser-based

2265
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,840
multi-party game

2266
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:52,000
almost i will come to that later so the

2267
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,120
idea is you choose a name when you go to

2268
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,280
the website of the pro

2269
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,519
of the game you choose the name uh you

2270
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,800
can either join a game by using a code

2271
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,960
someone provided you

2272
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,800
or create a new game choosing like funny

2273
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,000
names for initiate and responder like

2274
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,080
alice and bob

2275
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,440
very funny and then the task for the

2276
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,360
protocol like have fun

2277
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,719
or establish a shared secret or

2278
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,679
something you can give the

2279
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:15,360
the entities initial knowledge and then

2280
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,679
everyone will start a protocol

2281
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,599
like as many protocols as there are

2282
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,360
players

2283
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,440
everyone will send a protocol message

2284
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,880
say what new private variables the

2285
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,799
entity knows

2286
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,960
and everyone will continue the protocol

2287
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:32,719
seeing only the previous message

2288
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:35,840
and sending a next message until

2289
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,400
like a very very funny protocol at the

2290
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,120
end is

2291
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:43,759
revealed to everyone so the problem is

2292
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,599
or why is this more of a late c-fail

2293
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,520
talk instead of a successful ramp

2294
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,000
session talk

2295
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,040
front-end html javascript css blah blah

2296
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,239
blah back-end

2297
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:58,400
rust i choose to do this in rust

2298
01:32:54,239 --> 01:33:01,120
oh my god why rust

2299
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,920
rust cannot prove that you did all the

2300
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,800
error

2301
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,639
handling rust this is like doing a

2302
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,520
crypto paper and not publishing it

2303
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:11,760
until you have a like a formally proved

2304
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,920
crypto verified easy proof

2305
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,520
crypt proof instead of a handwritten i

2306
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,800
mean hand wavy

2307
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:22,880
proof this is like choosing rus or no

2308
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:26,639
gs i mean why did i do this alone

2309
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:29,199
and in rust for a proof of concept game

2310
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,320
so open problems finish the game do it

2311
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:32,480
like actual

2312
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,519
crypto e not just send the messages in

2313
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,199
plain text

2314
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,159
more than two entities maybe not only

2315
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:40,879
alice and bob syntax highlighting emojis

2316
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:42,480
automatic security analysis why not a

2317
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,840
three-dimensional version

2318
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:48,959
so this is a free libre open source

2319
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,040
software under the a gpl

2320
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,480
you can't play it because i didn't

2321
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:56,239
finish it because i did

2322
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:58,440
choose rust because i just yeah

2323
01:33:56,239 --> 01:34:00,799
i was too proud to do it in like a

2324
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:02,879
non-profitable secure memory safe

2325
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,679
language like node.js i want to do it in

2326
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,600
rust

2327
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,800
because usually i do proofs and crypto

2328
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:11,040
varies instead of

2329
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:15,600
buying benjamin so join the development

2330
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:19,199
i planted this aircon tree so

2331
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:22,400
so uh

2332
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:24,638
we'll go back to multi

2333
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,638
uh

2334
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:30,400
and uh so moti do you manage to share

2335
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,000
your screen or do you want to use the

2336
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,159
slides that you submitted to

2337
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,159
us

2338
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,519
i didn't share the screen but i put it

2339
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:42,559
on the browser and i hope from there to

2340
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,880
be able to share one second

2341
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,000
it's going to be a bit clumsy but you

2342
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,280
know we have to

2343
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,440
solve problems did you change your slide

2344
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:55,040
since yesterday since you submitted no

2345
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:58,080
no i didn't but let me let me try

2346
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,080
to shared up

2347
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,119
this one

2348
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:06,559
[Music]

2349
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:10,320
did it share yes yes it's working

2350
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:12,840
yeah okay

2351
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,280
so uh i'm going to talk about

2352
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:17,199
re-randomizable

2353
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,480
rcca security receiver anonymous and

2354
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:21,678
generic construction

2355
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:24,718
joint work with uh

2356
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:30,000
rong mao chen shini wang

2357
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:32,719
yiwang and guomin yang and

2358
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,159
you know ram session is a has been

2359
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:38,880
always a combination

2360
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:38,879
of fun and relaxation

2361
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,560
celebration and jubilation but also a

2362
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:47,840
little bit of education

2363
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:50,800
so i decided to give actually something

2364
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,560
a technical result because uh i was

2365
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,639
inspired by uh

2366
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,880
some of the talks i by definitely by

2367
01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:01,040
silvio talk about the models

2368
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:03,440
and the and the success of crypto and

2369
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:06,560
tom person talk about the 40 years and

2370
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,719
i'm sure crypto will go another 40 years

2371
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,000
because it's it's needed in technology

2372
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,199
and it's it's an area

2373
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,920
of uh of uh

2374
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,879
great scholarship and and great results

2375
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,560
internally and

2376
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:24,639
externally so uh

2377
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:28,560
so cca is the uh

2378
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:31,920
is brent reminded us uh today is

2379
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:35,119
really a great notion

2380
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:39,840
for security i concentrate here on

2381
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,839
on the post challenge

2382
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:48,638
stage in which the adversary

2383
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:50,400
sends challenges the decryption

2384
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:54,320
challenges and it gets decrypted

2385
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:57,679
provided that it's not the challenge

2386
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:59,599
ciphertext so this is cca and it's an

2387
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:02,760
accepted notion but there are

2388
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:05,600
certain problems with it it's it's for

2389
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,600
non-randomizable

2390
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,880
ciphertex if you you can randomize the

2391
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,000
ciphertext

2392
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,880
you can change the c star which is the

2393
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,360
challenge and

2394
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,239
and and hide it and it has some

2395
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,159
limitations for example if i take uh

2396
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:22,159
a ciphertext and adds some dummy

2397
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:23,920
information to it then if i play only

2398
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:27,119
with the dummy and actually

2399
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:30,960
not change the the ciphertext itself

2400
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:34,000
suddenly it's not cca so for this uh

2401
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:38,560
replayable cca was uh

2402
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:41,920
invented by capital in 2003

2403
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,880
in which uh it's it's almost the same

2404
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,920
game but

2405
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:48,400
when you have the when you have the

2406
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,520
the two the two possible ciphertext

2407
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,759
messages

2408
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,840
the decryption oracle is access to these

2409
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,159
messages and never

2410
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,400
uh reply to you if you if if the

2411
01:37:56,159 --> 01:38:00,480
decryption is one of those

2412
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,559
it just it just tells you it's a replay

2413
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,440
and it doesn't tell you which

2414
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,239
and and and and this way for example you

2415
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,879
can

2416
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:10,400
re-randomize now the ciphertext and and

2417
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,280
and things like this

2418
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,679
and the the the problem that we dealt

2419
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,480
with

2420
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,360
is indeed we re-randomizable uh

2421
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:20,959
replayable

2422
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:22,000
cca uh in which you can take the

2423
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,400
ciphertext and

2424
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:31,760
and using the using various means you

2425
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:35,679
you you can play with it and

2426
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,880
now this type of uh randomizable

2427
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,199
ciphertext has

2428
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:42,320
applications prime primarily and

2429
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:44,879
originally in anonymous communication

2430
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:46,320
in privacy private channels mixed

2431
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,040
networks

2432
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,400
also more recently controllable

2433
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:53,760
functional encryption

2434
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:54,719
and message transmission with reverse

2435
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,080
firewalls

2436
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:01,760
uh protection

2437
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:04,480
so uh which also require uh randomizable

2438
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,159
ciphertext so the the right notion is

2439
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:09,678
this randomizable

2440
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:12,159
rcaa cca

2441
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,199
and what is the state of the art the

2442
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:18,080
state of the art

2443
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:21,919
is uh uh that

2444
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:24,960
that we have we have a few scheme

2445
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:28,000
uh i look at primarily at the

2446
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:31,679
zero pr07 per baccarat

2447
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:34,679
and rosulik they they had

2448
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,920
the only universal universally

2449
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:39,679
randomizable

2450
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,000
one which is it's universal because you

2451
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,040
don't

2452
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,360
need the you don't need the the

2453
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,000
to use the public key in order to do the

2454
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:51,119
re-randomization

2455
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:54,320
and therefore it's very good for for

2456
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:56,080
privacy applications and but

2457
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,360
and there are other notions but none of

2458
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,679
them

2459
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:04,159
gave us receiver anonymity and in fact

2460
01:40:00,679 --> 01:40:07,199
pr07 explicitly asked how to construct

2461
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:10,638
receiver anonymous randomizable

2462
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:14,080
rcca public encryption

2463
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:17,199
and receiver anonymity

2464
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,840
which they also defined but they didn't

2465
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:21,280
give

2466
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:23,679
a construction or approve is the

2467
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:26,960
similar game to before but now you have

2468
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:29,520
two public key encryptions pk0 and pk1

2469
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,800
you run the same challenges you have the

2470
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,199
replayable one

2471
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,480
they know the messages they never answer

2472
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:37,519
on the messages they only

2473
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:39,839
answer decryption oracle on the rest and

2474
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:43,440
at the end you have to guess

2475
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:46,719
whether it's this challenge

2476
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:49,759
ciphertext was pk0

2477
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:50,480
belonging to player 0 or pk1 belonging

2478
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,360
to

2479
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,559
player 1. so it gives you a message

2480
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:57,839
anonymity

2481
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:02,480
so this is this is what we what we do

2482
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,480
we present the first receivable

2483
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:09,440
anonymous

2484
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:11,920
rand randomizable rcca apke

2485
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,919
it is

2486
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:19,840
based on the paper that suggested the

2487
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:22,000
notion but didn't give the encryption

2488
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,199
it's uh what's nice about cryptography

2489
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,520
is that you can come up with new

2490
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:28,638
problems but you can also solve

2491
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:31,119
all their problems this this is from o7

2492
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:32,560
and that's the first result that we got

2493
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,360
and then it's always good to have

2494
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,719
generic

2495
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:40,639
constructions uh for for for this

2496
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:43,920
and and which is uh gives you better

2497
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,360
uh possibilities for design so we have a

2498
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,719
variant from

2499
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:52,080
smoothing projective hashing and

2500
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:55,760
instantiated with great rings

2501
01:41:52,080 --> 01:42:00,559
graded rings and this is what we

2502
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:04,239
this is what we got and and and

2503
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,000
this demonstrates uh a typical progress

2504
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:09,280
in in the field

2505
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,719
and i think uh the ramp session is also

2506
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:13,360
good for those

2507
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:15,760
besides relaxations besides fun and

2508
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:20,719
besides having a society

2509
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:29,040
and a very nice community

2510
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:32,560

2556
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:19,519
excellent that's unfair i had to make up

2557

01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,280
it's not about cryptographic pairings

2581
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,280


2582
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,880

that would be a lie

2611

that would be a lie ah this would be lie

2612
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,880
that is she did not formulate it in the

2613
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,440
form of a question

2614
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,440
that is correct

2615
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:33,840
now and i think a did not make it and

2616
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:33,840
next in the line is team c

2617
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,000
something magic happens with the it was

2618
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,960
the hands but i think it was team c was

2619
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,920
after

2620
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:46,239
after the a team so i give me me is the

2621
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:49,280
next one to solve please

2622

who is the david nakash no

2624
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:56,239
that is not correct and the next hand i

2625
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,840
see

2626
01:48:56,239 --> 01:49:01,839

01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:22,080
[Laughter]

2632
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:25,119
i thought about your first year

2633
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,159
that was not fast enough the a-team the

2634
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:28,239
next question please

2635
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:29,679
the next cell again it's because you

2636
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:33,280
contributed to so much

2637
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,280
it's hard for me

2638
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:43,839
um we will pick a pictionary for 100.

2639
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:43,840
yes but before we do this yes okay

2640
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:59,760
you can go first um

2641
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:02,400
what is uh the ideal functionality for

2642
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,400
encryption

2643
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:09,119
uh let's write this thing oh i think

2644
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:11,199
that's the state of the art one could

2645
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:14,239
formulate it like this yes

2646
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:16,159
so here is your points

2647
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,759
and the a team is the next one to choose

2648
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:20,879

01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:25,040
wrote that one too

2664
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:27,920
time that's not a question

2665
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,920
who is stan

2666
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:33,920
but but you told me you were an

2667
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,360
excellent proof uh professionally in in

2668
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,679
uh jeopardy playing

2669
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:39,280
yes so who is star malcolm this is

2670
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:40,639
correct let me give you some points for

2671
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:43,679
that

2672
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,000
i think we should continue with uh the

2673
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,599
right

2674
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,040
was the main session with contribution

2675
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:51,920
talks yes yes so i hand over to martijn

2676
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,719
uh yes thank you very much so i hope

2677
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:57,599
that uh

2678
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:57,599
jeroen is ready because it's

2679
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:04,159
who is going to speak next on a novel

2680
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:07,360
and to and verifiable shuffle

2681
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:17,839
shuffles okay so please

2682
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:17,839
take take it away

2683
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:32,879
i hear just noise yeah we are only

2684
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:32,880
noise we don't hear you speak

2685
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:47,440
okay so i think we have to uh

2686
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:50,080
resolve this uh

2687
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,080
ah yes

2688
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:59,840
uh javon can you say something please

2689
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,598
uh yeah so i think we have to

2690
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:06,000
unfortunately we have to

2691
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,639
skip to the next talk so you and if you

2692
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,520
can stop

2693
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:12,320
sharing we'll take this offline in the

2694
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:16,080
chat and see what's going on

2695
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:19,679
so igor semayev will then take over with

2696
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:26,239
algorithms for cis and multisys problems

2697
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:29,920
igor okay

2698
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:34,400
can you see my screen uh yes

2699
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,400
we can okay great

2700
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:42,639
so i want to advertise my recent result

2701
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,639
only just for a few minutes the time

2702
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:47,119
this is algorithm for system what is his

2703
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:50,480
problems

2704
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:53,519
so what is his problem

2705
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:55,280
so a is integer m and matrix where the

2706
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,199
number of rows is larger than number of

2707
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:59,679
columns and q is prime

2708
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:03,199
and new a real positive number and this

2709
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:06,400
problem is in fine integer and vector c

2710
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:09,199
bounded in euclidean length that is norm

2711
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,799
bounded but new and the c times a is

2712
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:14,480
zero monthly q

2713
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:19,280
a typical parameters for the cis problem

2714
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:19,280
are given in these three lines

2715
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,480
lines

2716
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,519
and then there are several methods to

2717
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:28,080
find

2718
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,920
assist solutions uh mostly based on

2719
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:32,159
latest enumeration

2720
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,599
latest reduction latest sieving and

2721
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,839
trade-offs

2722
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,800
and to my knowledge all of them are at

2723
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,719
least exponential

2724
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:44,320
complexity and another problem i want

2725
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:46,239
to say is the multisys problem that asks

2726
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:50,559
to find not one vector but

2727
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:53,598
n vectors and obviously that multisystem

2728
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:56,880
implies this problem

2729
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:59,280
in this work uh

2730
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:01,920
i introduced the algorithm for multisys

2731
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:05,280
problem and that is already

2732
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:09,920
published at cryptology print

2733
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:14,159
with this data and

2734
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:19,599
the main result of this work is that if

2735
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:22,080
those two parameters delta and at the

2736
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,880
uh one of them is tending to infinity

2737
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,320
then

2738
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,480
the problem may be solved in the

2739
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:29,759
sub-exponential time given

2740
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:31,598
by this formula but if

2741
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,239
these two parameters are both constants

2742
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:38,080
and multisyn's problem is solvable

2743
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:41,440
in exponential time for explicitly

2744
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,679
computed uh parameters of this function

2745
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,000
and

2746
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,199
analysis is heuristic that's what i

2747
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,320
wanted to say today

2748
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:52,320
thank you very much for your attention

2749
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:56,960
oh thank you indeed igor um

2750
01:55:52,320 --> 01:56:00,719
then next we go back to the fellows

2751
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:05,119
so if you can stop sharing your um

2752
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:15,840
and then on tigoni can share her screen

2753
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:15,839
and play the rest of the video

2754
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:23,840
okay it's next to last

2755
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:23,840
it's not the full video

2756
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,920
so let's enjoy our fellows

2757
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:35,280
[Music]

2758
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:38,639
for me crypto means friends

2759
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,440
signs running on the beach every morning

2760
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,320
at 7 00 am

2761
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:44,400
before the talks i do all my running for

2762
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:47,599
the era crypto

2763
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:51,519
conversations ideas puzzles

2764
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:55,040
community a few words to describe crypto

2765
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:58,639
would be scientifically stimulating and

2766
01:56:55,040 --> 01:57:00,159
awesome location well it is obviously a

2767
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,159
conference of a community that will

2768
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:05,119
kindly find creative ways to get around

2769
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:05,119
barriers and limits

2770
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:10,239
crypto in forward is on the marvel strip

2771
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:13,119
conference since

2772
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:14,638
we tried shrimp every time at the galata

2773
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:18,000
beach barbecues

2774
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:20,080
and crypto is about community the crypto

2775
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:24,480
conference is a hybrid

2776
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:24,480
best photography papers and

2777
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:39,709
[Music]

2778
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:47,360
i've chosen four words to describe

2779
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:48,480
crypto one is community one is

2780
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:52,159
excellence

2781
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:55,839
one is breadth and one is rigor

2782
01:57:52,159 --> 01:58:00,480
and crypto and icr

2783
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:05,199
are my scientific home community

2784
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:09,199
the international fun

2785
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:10,879
friendly for me crypto is a wonderful

2786
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:12,400
place to meet all my friends and to see

2787
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:14,480
what this awesome community is working

2788
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,480
on

2789
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:22,560
describe krypton less than four words

2790
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:24,480
where turing's disciples meet

2791
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,000
it's a little pretentious but i believe

2792
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:30,000
that's what it is

2793
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,199
crypto in four words cool science

2794
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
speeches

2795
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:35,519
shrimp any words that come to mind when

2796
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,560
i think about crypto

2797
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:41,119
crypto is intellectually stimulating for

2798
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:43,760
me it's often a highlight of the year

2799
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:45,199
but what i associate most with crypto is

2800
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:47,760
being among friends

2801
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:50,638
crypto is like a family reunion so i'm

2802
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:50,639
glad to see you all

2803
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,760
location location community sunny

beach bbq

2805
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:11,009
long live crypto cryptography

2806
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:14,279

2807
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:14,279
[Music]

2808
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:21,520
crypto is first of equals and a

2809
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:22,799
chocolate covered strawberry all i miss

2810
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,440
about crypto

2811
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:28,400
is the strawberries and of course

2812
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:28,400
chocolate strawberries

2813
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:35,440
shrimp chocolate covered strawberries

2814
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:37,040
i always enjoyed it not just because of

2815
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,320
the prawns and chocolate covered

2816
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:40,320
strawberries

2817
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:42,960
but because of the unparalleled

2818
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:44,960
environment and atmosphere

2819
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,639
did i mention the strawberries maybe

2820
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:58,719
i've had to take had a few of those in

2821
01:59:46,639 --> 02:00:01,920
the bath

2822
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:05,280
happy birthday crypto

2823
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:08,639
happy anniversary crypto for your 40th

2824
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,639
uh birthday

2825
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:16,000
happy 40th anniversary

2828
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:27,360
thank you so stay tuned to see the uncut

2829
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:30,719
video at the end of the ram session

2830
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,719
let me stop staring

2831
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:39,360
so now we can go back to jordan

2832
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:41,280
he's gonna tell us about novel

2833
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:43,280
end-to-end verifiable shuffles

2834
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:46,559
offering internal privacy with

2835
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:49,759
application to mixing and voting

2836
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,760
can you please share your screen

2837
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:58,239
now we can see but we don't hear you can

2838
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:58,239
you say something

2839
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,880
oh good

2840
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:14,639
or maybe not

2841
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:14,639
you say something like strawberry

2842
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,920
i think we don't hear you um

2843
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,119
what is zoom problems

2844
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,960
i'm gonna get points for that when we

2845
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:32,960
return right

2846
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:40,320
this trend this time it was mpc oh

2847
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:43,598
i think we have to move to the next

2848
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:47,440
speaker unfortunately because

2849
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:51,119
this isn't working so

2850
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:54,799
the next speakers have been

2851
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:56,000
shown on applications of the forgetful

2852
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,920
functor

2853
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,920
of an on an eavesdropper

2854
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:06,320
hello can everyone hear me and see the

2855
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,320
screen

2856
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:11,840
yes excellent okay great uh i'm habeen

2857
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,280
chang i'm a uh undergraduate at rice

2858
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,719
university and i'm very happy to be

2859
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,280
presenting my

2860
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:18,880
undergraduate research um just

2861
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,759
applications of the forgetful functor on

2862
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:23,280
an eavesdropper

2863
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:25,119
today so um if you are a fan of category

2864
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:26,159
theory which is a prerequisite for

2865
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:28,719
cryptography

2866
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:30,159
i'll go over the definition anyways

2867
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:30,719
category consists of a collection of

2868
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,480
objects

2869
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:34,000
in see oh by the way if you have any

2870
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:35,040
questions feel free to put it in the

2871
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,239
chat or in

2872
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:39,599
in zula a collection of uh morphisms

2873
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:41,199
from a to b

2874
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,119
uh which you can think of as arrows and

2875
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:45,280
a composition law uh

2876
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:47,119
for every three objects a b and c and

2877
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:48,639
that connects two morphisms

2878
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:50,159
these objects and morphism satisfy

2879
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,239
certain natural properties which

2880
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,598
um are so natural that they're left as

2881
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:55,678
an exercise

2882
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,599
um if you're not sure about category

2883
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,960
theory then

2884
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,560
just know that they're category

2885
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,480
equivalent to haskell so if you know

2886
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,159
haskell you know category theory

2887
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,519
and that should clear it up for everyone

2888
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:08,239
anyways um

2889
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,840
my claim is that humans are categories

2890
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:11,519
so what is it what does that mean humans

2891
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:14,159
are categories well

2892
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,960
it means that as a proof sketch a human

2893
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:20,320
h consists of a collection of thoughts

2894
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:23,040
uh th a collection con a b

2895
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:24,960
for every two thoughts in the category

2896
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,800
um a collection of connections from a to

2897
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,599
b and the composition of connections of

2898
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,920
thoughts

2899
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,119
is commonly known as the train of

2900
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,320
thought

2901
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:37,759
um and i depicted that below in the uh

2902
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:39,679
in the diagram um thoughts is a group so

2903
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:41,679
there is also a group structure for when

2904
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:44,480
you are thinking of something

2905
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:46,800
as a definition the free group fs over a

2906
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:49,678
given s consists of all words g h g

2907
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,719
for example if g and h were in member or

2908
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:53,599
members of s

2909
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,920
that can be built from members of s so

2910
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:56,239
um

2911
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,440
my claim is that thoughts in your mind

2912
02:03:56,239 --> 02:03:59,440
are free groups

2913
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:01,360
and what does that mean well a thought

2914
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:02,559
consists of words built from members of

2915
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:05,759
the set abc

2916
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:06,639
xyz where s is the set of all alphabet

2917
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,400
characters

2918
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:10,880
so when you have a thought like i want

2919
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:14,159
pizza tonight that is a collection

2920
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,440
a word inside this free group consisting

2921
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:17,040
of this set

2922
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,799
so how does this all apply to

2923
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,639
cryptography well um

2924
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,840
for that we need another notion that is

2925
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:23,920
the functor

2926
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,239
a functor is a map between categories

2927
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,159
and um a forgetful functor

2928
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:29,919
forgets some of the input structure or

2929
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:32,960
properties what does that mean

2930
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:36,079
so given g a group for example we

2931
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,280
take that forget g is a set we drop the

2932
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:40,559
group structure

2933
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:42,880
and then we let forget g be a set

2934
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,960
so how does that apply to this uh this

2935
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,840
uh model this sort of scheme that we

2936
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,520
have here

2937
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,040
so suppose we have alex and betty who

2938
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:52,800
wish to communicate and a

2939
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:53,360
um and a eavesdropper who wishes to

2940
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,719
listen in

2941
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:57,040
this is an accurate depiction of a

2942
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:58,960
eavesdropper and the way that we can

2943
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,760
send a secure message between alex and

2944
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:03,119
betty

2945
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,920
is by um submitting the forgetful

2946
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:06,239
functor

2947
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,599
joined with um the message m and the

2948
02:05:06,239 --> 02:05:09,440
message m can be in a

2949
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:11,199
plain text it doesn't actually matter

2950
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:13,440
whether you encrypt it or not

2951
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:14,239
and when the eavesdropper receives this

2952
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,559
message for yet

2953
02:05:14,239 --> 02:05:17,678
m well they're thinking about hacking

2954
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,520
you right

2955
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:20,719
so the issue is that this is a thought

2956
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,560
and as i said

2957
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,719
the thoughts in your head form a free

2958
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,599
group so when you receive the forgetful

2959
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:27,599
functor

2960
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,960
the words in your head turn into just

2961
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,480
the set of the letters

2962
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,480
so you're no longer left with thoughts

2963
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:35,280
you're simply left with

2964
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:36,480
letters by themselves which can uh no

2965
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:38,000
longer function

2966
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:40,079
and at this point immediately you may

2967
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,199
need a speech pathologist because you

2968
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:43,599
are confused

2969
02:05:41,199 --> 02:05:46,000
and can no longer form valid words in

2970
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:48,400
your head

2971
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,079
um in conclusion you use the forgetful

2972
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:51,920
hunter to incapacitate

2973
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,679
the eavesdropper and i will now take any

2974
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:56,560
questions and i see a lot of

2975
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:57,920
activity in the uh zoom chat so i will

2976
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:00,639
go there and see if there are

2977
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,800
any one or two questions i can answer um

2978
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:04,560
well i think for answering questions uh

2979
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,159
you can ask them in the in the chat but

2980
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,360
not during the

2981
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:11,040
uh the rum session live so okay perfect

2982
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:16,559
so i will answer these questions through

2983
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:18,800
zoom but um so please please take me

2984
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,000
yeah so thank you very much for your

2985
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:23,119
presentations and then

2986
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:26,560
uh so i encourage everybody to

2987
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:30,639
to engage with have been on on zulip

2988
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:33,040
to ask questions um are you guys hearing

2989
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,040
me though

2990
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,960
you're not stalking ah

2991
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:42,159
yes you're here but uh i'm also

2992
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,159
wondering whether jean-jacques is

2993
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:49,199
around

2994
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:51,919
let me know when i can talk yeah well uh

2995
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:53,119
if as he's not here and we can hear you

2996
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,800
uh you can talk now so

2997
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:58,320
try to share your screen and then

2998
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:00,639
hopefully we keep hearing you

2999
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,639
um

3000
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:15,360
okay is it showing now

3001
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:17,199
okay okay thank you um i'll try to

3002
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,799
enlarge a little sorry for the technical

3003
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:21,199
problems i've been using

3004
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,320
zoom before and but never with this kind

3005
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:24,960
of difficulties

3006
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,199
i'm going to talk very quickly about a

3007
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:30,400
new uh

3008
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:32,879
thing related to to mixing or shuffling

3009
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:33,519
um we this is a research you've been

3010
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,639
doing

3011
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:38,560
with other people um and i'm going to

3012
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:41,360
explain it through

3013
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:43,199
a message shuffle okay so what's the the

3014
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,440
problem that we usually have we have a

3015
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:48,799
bunch of messages on the left and

3016
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:51,360
we want to uh shuffle them anonymously

3017
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:52,320
maintaining an anonymity and on the

3018
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:55,440
right we get the

3019
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:56,880
the the message uh permuted in some

3020
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:59,199
arbitrary order

3021
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,840
that that is the problem that we we are

3022
02:07:59,199 --> 02:08:03,678
looking at the simplified version of it

3023
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:05,360
um and the problem always the

3024
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:08,800
cryptographic problem that we have

3025
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:11,839
is how can we be sure that

3026
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:12,480
the shepherd is really honest how can we

3027
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:15,360
be sure

3028
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:16,718
that the shelter maintains integrity of

3029
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,320
the set of inputs

3030
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:20,320
and in many cases we have to be

3031
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,840
physically present or you have to trust

3032
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:25,440
the shuffler which is

3033
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:27,920
really bad so we have solutions along

3034
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:30,799
these lines i'm i'm thinking of

3035
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,520
david jones cascade of mixes in which

3036
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,960
you have

3037
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:37,280
in every every round of mixing

3038
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:39,760
you have to verify that mixing has been

3039
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:42,800
done correctly

3040
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:45,520
we have another solution by by andrew

3041
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:48,719
neff who uses symmetric polynomials

3042
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:51,920
this this is um the problem

3043
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:55,119
that we're trying to to address here um

3044
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:55,760
and what it's what is going to be

3045
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:58,480
involved

3046
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,719
is a check code which you can also think

3047
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:02,959
as a tracking number or a receipt

3048
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:04,079
and so these the objects that we are

3049
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,719
creating

3050
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:08,320
are actually there are variations of of

3051
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:10,159
peterson commitments

3052
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:11,519
but you shouldn't think think of them as

3053
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:14,000
commitment you should really think of

3054
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:17,679
them as as check codes

3055
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:20,639
and the variation is that we

3056
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:22,480
we do not do the the message itself but

3057
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:25,599
we do the hash of the message

3058
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:28,000
and and actually i think now and moron

3059
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:31,679
have used this before in another paper

3060
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,960
um we keep two hashes to keep the the

3061
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:34,719
binding property

3062
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:37,360
and so you rather cheerfully you get

3063
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:39,920
homomorphism and you get commutativity

3064
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:41,040
but what we are after in the context of

3065
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:43,840
our protocol

3066
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,840
is that we have uh that we have

3067
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,079
permutation

3068
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:51,440
invariant property

3069
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:53,599
that it means oh i should say that the r

3070
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:55,839
plus is the sum of the of the random

3071
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:56,400
numbers so if you have two commitments

3072
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:00,239
they have

3073
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:03,040
r1 and r2 then r plus is the sum

3074
02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:04,638
modulum uh the prime the the order of

3075
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:08,400
the group that you're in

3076
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:10,079
um the sum is this value so in the case

3077
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:13,920
of or and you have many

3078
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:14,799
many uh commitments or checkouts i

3079
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,400
should say

3080
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:21,760
um this this r plus is the the sum

3081
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:24,799
of the the ri okay

3082
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:26,639
and so what we get by using this special

3083
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,880
kind of uh

3084
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,840
the variation of the piercing commitment

3085
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:33,599
we get

3086
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:36,800
um that they are permutation invariant

3087
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:40,159
now this is essential in the the the

3088
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:42,560
protocol which i'm i'm shortly showing

3089
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:45,280
you here

3090
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:47,520
on the left you can see user one of the

3091
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:49,440
user n they are submitting

3092
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,560
the message and they are submitting a

3093
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:53,199
randomness r

3094
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,079
and they are submitting a commitment and

3095
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:56,239
so

3096
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:57,199
the message the end users are going to

3097
02:10:56,239 --> 02:11:00,320
do that and then

3098
02:10:57,199 --> 02:11:03,440
at the end um

3099
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:06,320
the the shuffler is going to to

3100
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:07,199
that there's a time and after that he's

3101
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:10,880
going to

3102
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:13,280
um go to

3103
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,360
publish all the messages in permuted

3104
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:18,119
order that's the first message table

3105
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:19,440
and there the order is is arbitrary or

3106
02:11:18,119 --> 02:11:22,480
electrographically

3107
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:25,119
having no relation with the the input

3108
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:28,239
the second

3109
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:29,440
table is the table of the commitments or

3110
02:11:28,239 --> 02:11:33,199
of the check codes

3111
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:36,000
which which can maintain

3112
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:38,079
the the order it can even publish the

3113
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,840
identity of the people there's no

3114
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:41,519
no no problem there because the

3115
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:44,719
commitments as you will

3116
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:47,440
realize they are unconditionally

3117
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:48,960
hiding and there is no relation between

3118
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:50,638
the first part of the table and the

3119
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:53,360
second part of the table

3120
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:54,560
and then also the the the shifter is

3121
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:58,559
going to

3122
02:11:54,560 --> 02:12:03,520
compute and and publish the sum

3123
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:06,560
of all the the random numbers

3124
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:08,239
and it's going to also we need some a

3125
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,960
lot of zero knowledge proofs to make it

3126
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:11,360
work

3127
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:13,360
um and so what are the properties that

3128
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:14,239
we claim well the first property is that

3129
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:18,839
any person

3130
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:20,879
can excuse me can you wrap up

3131
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:24,239
please um

3132
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:27,199
oh sure i'm i'm i'm

3133
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:29,360
sorry i'm taking more time than that um

3134
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:30,079
the the essential thing here is that we

3135
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:33,280
have a

3136
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:36,880
verification procedure um

3137
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:36,880
the product of all the check codes

3138
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:43,759
should match um

3139
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:46,239
the properties are claimed are are here

3140
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:49,280
we have a message mixing scheme

3141
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:51,759
um with unconditional integrity

3142
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:54,320
and con um sorry integrity under the

3143
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:56,960
discrete log random oracle assumption

3144
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:58,400
a full end-to-end verifiability the

3145
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,520
applications are

3146
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:04,559
are here um we can we can apply it

3147
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:08,000
apart from mixing we can apply to voting

3148
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:11,119
um we can enhance existing

3149
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,480
voting schemes um and we can even mix

3150
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:15,280
arbitrary objects

3151
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:16,000
so so this is the end of the talk and i

3152
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:19,040
should

3153
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,599
in line with the the most topic

3154
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:22,159
the topic of the ram session i should

3155
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:24,800
say that

3156
02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:25,920
i i like strawberry and i like chocolate

3157
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,159
independently but i

3158
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:30,560
actually never liked the combination

3159
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:31,598
about sorry for taking so much of your

3160
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,320
time

3161
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:35,360
okay thank you very much uh then we'll

3162
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:39,119
go straight to

3163
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:40,400
the next talk so that from running honey

3164
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:43,839
badger to

3165
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:46,159
flying dumbo asynchronous consensus goes

3166
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,159
real

3167
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,920
uh can everybody help me and see my

3168
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:55,599
slides

3169
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:57,599
yes uh okay uh hi everyone uh

3170
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:59,760
i'm i'm going to try to convince you a

3171
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:01,199
highly non-trivial statement that flying

3172
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:04,880
is still faster than

3173
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:06,799
running in next few minutes and

3174
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:08,079
asynchronous consensus is arguably the

3175
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:10,400
most robust and also

3176
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:11,280
most system-friendly consensus in

3177
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,759
practice

3178
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,400
uh well unfortunately due to the famous

3179
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,840
flp

3180
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:18,159
impossibility it's quite difficult to

3181
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:20,000
get those uh asynchronous protocols

3182
02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:21,759
over the years people have developed

3183
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,719
devoted a lot of efforts designing all

3184
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,480
kinds of nice and

3185
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:26,079
fancy protocols to show theory radical

3186
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:29,040
feasibility they are mostly

3187
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:30,639
quite complicated and very few of them

3188
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:33,440
have ever been implemented

3189
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:35,360
only until very recently people start to

3190
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,960
seriously wonder whether such kind of

3191
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,159
asynchronous protocol can ever be

3192
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,840
practical

3193
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:41,759
well the most unnoticeable work probably

3194
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:44,560
is honeybaker bft who

3195
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:45,679
improved a classical protocol and showed

3196
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,159
the implementation

3197
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:49,679
which actually demonstrated a promising

3198
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:51,920
uh performance

3199
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:53,599
in our recent serial work we call dumbo

3200
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,560
we give a more affirmative answer to

3201
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:56,320
this question

3202
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:58,320
originally yesterday is a political

3203
02:14:56,320 --> 02:15:00,159
slogan but now we think about it is more

3204
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:02,559
like a nostalgia

3205
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:04,480
anyway so i will try to provide more

3206
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:06,960
scientific evidence to support this

3207
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:09,280
and common method to constructing atomic

3208
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,920
broadcast or asynchronous consensus is

3209
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:11,840
via

3210
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:14,320
a component called asynchronous common

3211
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,840
subset a such acs protocol have two

3212
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:18,559
different ways to construct it

3213
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,679
one is due to bengal from asynchronous

3214
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,280
binary agreement

3215
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:22,800
the other one is due to caching at all

3216
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:25,360
from validated uh

3217
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,520
va which is called mvba and honey better

3218
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:29,199
bft explicitly took the

3219
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:31,040
bernoull pass and because they consider

3220
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:32,799
mvp as a major bond net

3221
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:35,280
and because of the large communication

3222
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:37,599
complexity well in our recent work

3223
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:38,719
dumbo which are we appear in the coming

3224
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:40,400
success we actually

3225
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:42,239
show that this view might be too

3226
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:43,040
pessimistic we give a better

3227
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:46,480
construction

3228
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:48,079
of atomic broadcast from mvpa despite of

3229
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:48,959
the large communication complexity of

3230
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:50,719
mvva

3231
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:53,119
but the resulting atomic broadcast is

3232
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:54,239
perfectly fine and more importantly the

3233
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:56,000
running time

3234
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:58,159
from originally depending on the number

3235
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,440
of nodes noun was pushed to down a very

3236
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:02,159
small constant

3237
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:03,440
this asymptotical improvement actually

3238
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:05,360
can be

3239
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:07,040
obviously shown in the experimental

3240
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:09,598
result uh that the

3241
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:11,119
if the for example latency if it depends

3242
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:13,360
on number of nodes then when

3243
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:15,040
the scale go when the protocol scales up

3244
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:15,920
it becomes much much slower while our

3245
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:17,599
protocol

3246
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:19,760
is a dumbbell particle still somehow

3247
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,560
stable and also the benefits was also

3248
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:24,560
shown in the

3249
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:26,560
throughput the besides those uh

3250
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:28,320
those concrete improvements are another

3251
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,400
advantages i think the

3252
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:32,160
more interesting message from the dumbo

3253
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:33,599
is that mvp is

3254
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,439
seeing still the right way for

3255
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:37,519
constructing atomic broadcast

3256
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,960
so for this reason we also open the box

3257
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:40,559
of mvp and

3258
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:42,398
examine whether we can also push down

3259
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:45,199
the communication there

3260
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:47,279
and along the way we indeed resolve a

3261
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,760
long-standing open problem in the domain

3262
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:51,599
the original mvp was proposed by uh

3263
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,840
formulated by concerto for the purpose

3264
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:54,880
of

3265
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:57,439
atomic broadcast they left an explicit

3266
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:59,358
urban problem in their crypto01 paper

3267
02:16:57,439 --> 02:17:00,318
that to reduce the large communication

3268
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:03,359
complexity

3269
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:04,240
of mvp and also the resulting autonomic

3270
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:07,120
broadcast

3271
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:08,318
after almost 20 years uh finally abraham

3272
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,559
medal made some

3273
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:13,199
breakthrough to remove the cubic factor

3274
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:15,759
unfortunately the problem remains open

3275
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:16,240
for the atomic broadcast when the input

3276
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,880
size

3277
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:21,039
is not so small which is indeed the case

3278
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:22,398
in atomic broadcast so we continue

3279
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:24,160
pushing down the communication and

3280
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:25,119
reduce another factor of n in the

3281
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,679
communication

3282
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,719
those performance already come kind of

3283
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,200
close to optimal

3284
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:32,959
the most important thing is then it are

3285
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:34,719
going to be directly translated into the

3286
02:17:32,959 --> 02:17:36,799
resulting atomic broadcast

3287
02:17:34,718 --> 02:17:38,638
again this kind of justice justifies

3288
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:41,039
again um

3289
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:43,358
mvp does not have to suffer from large

3290
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,800
communication complexity and again it

3291
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:46,639
it is indeed the right way for

3292
02:17:44,799 --> 02:17:48,718
constructing ss uh

3293
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:50,398
as i promised to show you more evidence

3294
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:51,759
is going real

3295
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:54,398
we're actually in the middle of

3296
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:56,559
integrating this dumbbell protocols into

3297
02:17:54,398 --> 02:17:57,439
jd's blockchain platform in case you

3298
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:59,920
haven't heard of

3299
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,920
jd is essentially chinese amazon which

3300
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:03,760
has hundreds of millions of users

3301
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,760
so with all those factors combined i

3302
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,439
hope i kind of convinced you and i

3303
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:10,398
finished the proof that flying is

3304
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:11,359
indeed faster than running and our paper

3305
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:15,840
can be found

3306
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:19,120
on apron thanks a lot thank you indeed

3307
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:22,240
um so then we go to

3308
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:22,800
the last technical talk of the rum

3309
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:27,199
session

3310
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:31,199
so we're almost at the end it's benjamin

3311
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,200
on streamlight simplifying consensus

3312
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:39,200
hi um hold on let me

3313
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:40,800
oh hold on i need to go to security

3314
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:44,240
sorry system preferences security and

3315
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:44,240
privacy settings to share

3316
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:47,920
i did not set this up ahead of time

3317
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:53,120
yes

3318
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:56,938
um

3319
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:56,939
[Music]

3320
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:07,840
zoom will not record the contents of

3321
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:07,839
your screen until it is quick

3322
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:13,599
well that's very secure yes yes indeed

3323
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:20,718
[Music]

3324
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:24,960
so

3325
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:24,959
that is indeed a bit uh surprising

3326
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:30,719
so i guess well uh

3327
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,840
i don't know

3328
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:43,280
am i am i back i'm sorry there you are

3329
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,280
all right let's see if this works now

3330
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:51,600
okay awesome yes how

3331
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:51,600
it's very black though oh

3332
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:59,280
why does this work

3333
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:01,920
oh yes now you can see it amazing

3334
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:02,479
all right last technical talk of the day

3335
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:04,960
um

3336
02:20:02,479 --> 02:20:06,479
thank you for bearing with me i am ben

3337
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:08,800
and

3338
02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:10,160
i'm here to pub a joint work with lane

3339
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:12,720
she which is a

3340
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:13,600
simple consensus protocol called

3341
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,800
streamlit

3342
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:17,840
and the goal is really to convince you

3343
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:19,438
that hey maybe

3344
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,040
this is a simple enough protocol that

3345
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:22,080
you might incorporate into your classes

3346
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,200
when you teach

3347
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:28,399
students like me so

3348
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:30,720
hopefully you find it entertaining i'll

3349
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:32,640
start off by saying the following

3350
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,920
every computer science undergraduate

3351
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:37,760
should graduate knowing

3352
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:41,600
three things first how to sort a list

3353
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:43,280
second whether one-way functions exist

3354
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,280
and third how to solve byzantine

3355
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:47,600
agreement

3356
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:49,439
and one of these is not like the other

3357
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,960
and you might know which one

3358
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:52,640
if you guessed the third one you're

3359
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:56,560
correct

3360
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:59,039
because it's hard

3361
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:01,039
and i mean hard in not the uh formal

3362
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:04,080
sense but in the hard to teach sense

3363
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:05,760
and i guess you already know consensus

3364
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:07,120
protocols have this reputation for

3365
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,520
being difficult to understand and hard

3366
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,520
to teach

3367
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:14,880
and this is where streamlight the

3368
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:14,880
protocol comes in um

3369
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:19,359
we want a short and we think it fills

3370
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:22,080
this fairly large gap of

3371
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:24,399
needing a short and sweet simple

3372
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:26,560
teachable consensus protocol

3373
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:27,599
but hopefully it's entertaining all

3374
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:29,519
right so now i'm going to try to

3375
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,040
describe it in three minutes

3376
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:33,120
i'm actually going to be talking about a

3377
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:35,439
very related problem and overhype

3378
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:38,000
problem called the blockchain problem

3379
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:39,439
um and we're going to start off in the

3380
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,720
permission world so we have n

3381
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:44,560
players and i'm going to isolate

3382
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:47,039
or hold on one third of them might be

3383
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,359
malicious i'm going to isolate two of

3384
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,840
them

3385
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:51,359
alice and bob notice that i've

3386
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,800
faithfully recreated

3387
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:55,439
uh alice and bob from one of shopping

3388
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:57,679
shopee goldbosser's early intro slides

3389
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:00,640
because for some reason these images are

3390
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:00,640
etched into my mind

3391
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:06,319
and alice and bob communicate over this

3392
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,840
partially synchronous network

3393
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:09,680
each of them has some view of a

3394
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:11,680
blockchain

3395
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:13,359
and each of them is going to finalize a

3396
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:14,960
piece of the blockchain as output and

3397
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:16,240
these green blocks represent the

3398
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:17,839
finalized blockchain

3399
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:21,680
and they're the blocks that alice and

3400
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:23,680
bob should eventually hopefully agree on

3401
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:24,960
and the key property we want is the

3402
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:27,520
agreement property

3403
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:29,438
where alice's finalized blockchain and

3404
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:31,359
bob's finalized blockchains are prefixes

3405
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:32,479
of one another

3406
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:34,640
all right so now let's talk about

3407
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:36,399
streamload itself

3408
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:37,840
the protocol is going to operate in

3409
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:38,240
epochs all right and we're going to

3410
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,840
start

3411
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:41,359
and these epochs are going to be

3412
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:41,680
synchronized so everyone's always in the

3413
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:44,240
same

3414
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:45,680
epoch maybe they're about two seconds

3415
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:46,880
each we can tune it

3416
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,880
we're going to start with the genesis

3417
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:53,519
block let's see what happens in epoch 1.

3418
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:55,199
a leader is going to propose a block

3419
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:56,800
extending the genesis block and i've

3420
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,920
denoted it leader's block on the slide

3421
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:59,438
here

3422
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:01,520
will contain a hash of a parent some

3423
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,760
epoch number some transactions

3424
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:05,680
and a bunch of voters are going to vote

3425
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:08,080
for this block and once you accumulate

3426
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:09,600
a super majority votes from the network

3427
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:12,240
two-thirds of them

3428
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:14,640
then we can notarize this block and add

3429
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:17,119
it to the blockchain

3430
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:19,039
and we repeat this for successive epochs

3431
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,880
in each epoch we want to try to add a

3432
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,800
block to the blockchain

3433
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:24,800
all right so you buck two maybe succeeds

3434
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:25,679
at adding a block maybe epoch 3 was a

3435
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:27,920
dummy epoch

3436
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:29,359
and the network got partitioned nothing

3437
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:31,520
happened

3438
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:34,160
epoch 4 might have been successful and

3439
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,600
so on and so forth we might have forks

3440
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:38,640
and eventually we want to be able to

3441
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,319
apply our sweet finalization rule

3442
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:42,399
and finalize a piece of the blockchain

3443
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:45,359
and reach agreement

3444
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:46,000
so how do we actually decide on which

3445
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:48,000
voters

3446
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,520
sorry which blocks to vote for and which

3447
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,600
blocks to propose

3448
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:54,000
and this is the crux of our protocol

3449
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,840
it's really simple

3450
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,760
the leader is going to propose a block

3451
02:23:55,840 --> 02:24:00,160
extending the longest notarized chain

3452
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:01,680
that they've seen so far

3453
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:04,080
and the voters are going to vote for

3454
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,399
that block if and only if

3455
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:09,760
it also extends the longest notarized

3456
02:24:06,399 --> 02:24:11,519
chain that the voter has seen so far

3457
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:13,040
recall that notarized means that

3458
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:16,720
two-thirds of the network has voted for

3459
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:16,720
a block and these are digital signatures

3460
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:20,800
and finally the finalization rule is

3461
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,319
well as soon as we see

3462
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:24,479
three consecutive blocks with

3463
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:26,160
consecutive epoch numbers

3464
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:28,000
we can chop off the last block on that

3465
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:29,680
chain and finalize it

3466
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,920
and in the last minute i have or maybe

3467
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:33,600
30 seconds i'll go over a finalization

3468
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:34,399
example we take the example we had from

3469
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:38,000
the

3470
02:24:34,399 --> 02:24:38,960
earlier slides we see epoch 6 box 7 and

3471
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,800
epoch 8

3472
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:45,759
in a row all right we can finalize this

3473
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,759
piece of the blockchain

3474
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,600
and why does this work it works because

3475
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:51,680
i'm going to argue

3476
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:53,040
that we can't have any other block at

3477
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:56,000
the same height as this

3478
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:57,120
epoch 7 block it's going to be unique at

3479
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,319
its height

3480
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,880
it's a very simple argument i'll defer

3481
02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:04,000
it to

3482
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:06,640
the actual paper or future talks but

3483
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,640
basically any block and past or future

3484
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:11,039
that is notarized won't be at the same

3485
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,358
height so any future chain growth must

3486
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:16,080
be

3487
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:16,080
a descendant of this epoch 7 block here

3488
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:21,920
yeah and that's it hopefully

3489
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:24,800
well we think that streamlight is a

3490
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:26,319
perfect protocol for you to teach

3491
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:28,080
at least i had a lot of fun

3492
02:25:26,319 --> 02:25:30,000
understanding it and you can find out

3493
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:32,880
more on e-prince or on

3494
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,920
inside elaine's new book i guess and

3495
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:39,839

3496
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:39,840
well enjoy the celebration

3497
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:48,160

3499
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,039
uh jean jacques uh uh

3500
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:55,040
unfortunately can't make it anymore

3501
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:57,280
because it uh as some of you might have

3502
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:00,240
noticed we're running slightly over time

3503
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:01,760
uh so it's a little bit late so he did

3504
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:04,080
send us a slide so we will make

3505
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:06,479
available his slides

3506
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:07,200
we thought of doing a camera okay but

3507
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:09,199
but

3508
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:11,280
uh for those of you who have ever seen

3509
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:12,479
uh jean-jacques rum session talk it's

3510
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:14,720
it's kind of

3511
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:15,519
you can't really imitate it it needs to

3512
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,279
be

3513
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:20,000
the original so that's unfortunately the

3514
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,280
best we can do um

3515
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,760
what we're now going to do is we're

3516
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:26,000
going to play a little bit more karaoke

3517
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:29,120
so people can still vote for who

3518
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,479
what is the best presentation uh i mean

3519
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,319
we're going to play jeopardy

3520
02:26:30,479 --> 02:26:34,319
uh who what is the best presentation

3521
02:26:32,319 --> 02:26:36,000
while we play jeopardy

3522
02:26:34,319 --> 02:26:37,519
then we will announce who has won the

3523
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,520
best presentation

3524
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:41,280
uh maybe there's a bit there's a winner

3525
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:44,640
for the jeopardy and then there is

3526
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:46,880
uh uh finally we finish with uh

3527
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:47,760

02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:20,399
that means the voting form for the best

3542
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,760
drum session talk

3543
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:27,199
i want to make two announcements um uh

3544
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:28,560
quickly um this the jeopardy system was

3545
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:31,600
uh programmed by simone

3546
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:33,519
thank you to samoa he's from uns and ibm

3547
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,840
the second thing is i got the question

3548
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:38,160
of whether the players get

3549
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:39,120
money for playing here and winning here

3550
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:42,080
and the answer

3551
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:43,680
is no they get something better namely

3552
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:45,680
this what they have there is what we

3553
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:49,280
call the cryptocurrency

3554
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:51,920
and they get cryptocurrency payout um

3555
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:52,960
with these words i would like to call

3556
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:56,960
our

3557
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:59,679
players back i see they are still there

3558
02:27:56,960 --> 02:28:02,560
and it is team meme that starts in the

3559
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:02,560
third session please

3560
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:06,160
you're muted

3561
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:14,080
meetings 500 where you choose

3562
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:16,560
yeah meetings 500 we need to bring up

3563
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:26,080

3566
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:36,160
no it was i think it's me what is

3567
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:36,160
jeopardy is super fun

3568
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:41,840
minus 500. that helps

3569
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:54,080
you should know this is your neck of the

3570
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:57,439
woods

3571
02:28:54,080 --> 02:29:00,240
uh this is norway right

3572
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:03,200
the what's else the key you're a crypt

3573
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:03,199
in helsinki

3574
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:09,680
well what's this a question what was

3575
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:11,920
eurocrypt in helsinki

3576
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:13,120
that is a question and it is not a good

3577
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:17,920
question for this

3578
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:22,240
uh answer and i guess then it's to team

3579
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:27,439
to the b team be a plan b stephen

3580

3582
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:37,840
meetings

3583
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:37,840

3587
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,640

3588
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:58,080
this is

3589
02:29:54,640 --> 02:30:01,119
500 points in cryptocurrency

3590
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:04,000
to the a-team well

3591
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:04,720
this is very distressing it's not going

3592
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,399
to be in

3593
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:09,920
um uh where it was supposed to be in

3594
02:30:07,399 --> 02:30:13,680
2021

3595
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:16,399

and that is stephen and plan b

3604
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:43,359
uh okay okay i might not be right

3605
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:43,359
um

3606
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:49,599
where is asia crypt i can't remember the

3607
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:49,600
year

3608
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:57,040
yes 2012.

3609
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:15,840
well apparently 500 was easier than 200.

3610
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,840
i give you a hint

3611
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:24,760
where yes

3612
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:27,438
where was where was asia crypt

3613
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:30,640
2019 that is

3614
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:31,680
correct i resolve and i give the points

3615
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:34,560
to the a-team

3616
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:36,880
leading i should have got that that's

3617
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,880
correct

3618
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:44,560
and we continue with the a-team

3619
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:44,560
for 200.

3620
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:53,600
that is plan b first

3621
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:55,438
uh what is identity based cryptography

3622
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:57,840
the category is called crypto papers

3623
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:57,840
200.

3624
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:08,399
and i lower your hand steven

3625
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:14,640
and tyler is next what is the

3626
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:14,640
pairings but um by linear pairings

3627
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:20,479
well they exist before that and and we

3628
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:25,840
understood before that so what

3629
02:32:20,479 --> 02:32:25,840
yes and the next one is the a-team or

3630
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:32,720
who is a co-author on the paper

3631
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:32,720
inventing identity-based encryption

3632
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:38,800
um maybe you should clarify last time

3633
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:40,479
for the 100th question was a paper title

3634
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:43,119
that was

3635
02:32:40,479 --> 02:32:45,599
sought for who offered the paper

3636
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:50,000
identity-based encryption

3637
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:53,840
but i already said that oh

3638
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,840
more precisely

3639
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:59,920
and we and we had papers on identity

3640
02:32:56,880 --> 02:33:03,358
based encryption in 90s already

3641
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:04,960
can i try again um i think i think i

3642
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:08,080
lower the hand over the a-team

3643
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:11,599
and we are at rachel uh

3644
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:15,439
what is identity-based encryption

3645
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:18,560
whale pairing something

3646
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:22,160
from the whale pairing so this is

3647
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:22,160
one of these three possible solutions

3648
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:27,200
so this is correct and gives many points

3649
02:33:26,399 --> 02:33:31,439
to plan

3650
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:36,479
b and we continue

3651
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:41,120
uh steven what do you want

3652
02:33:36,479 --> 02:33:41,119
us right i've given up caring

3653
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:49,840
uh so what about the fellows 500

3654
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:49,840
sure fellows 500.

3655
02:33:52,319 --> 02:33:56,880
there is the a team do you have any

3656
02:33:54,800 --> 02:34:00,800
plans to win today or something

3657
02:33:56,880 --> 02:34:00,800
who is who is the biggest

3658
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:05,120
this guy is david nakash the a team gets

3659
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:09,519
the points

3660
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:13,280
and we continue meetings 300.

3661
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:19,359
i'm trying to make a blue area for uh

3662
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:19,359
messing up with jasper but meetings 300

3663
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:35,120
that is mimi me but i think i'm confused

3664
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:35,119
what is that eurocrypt 2018

3665
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,359
it was until the vm okay so what is

3666
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:43,439
europe

3667
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:46,720
29. we continue with plan b

3668
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:49,760
i think plan b has a good idea as well

3669
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:52,720
uh where is the euro crypt 2017

3670
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:55,840
that is correct the generator was the

3671
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:55,840
president of the icr

3672
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,840
became

3673
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:09,119
that is plan b again what is the common

3674
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:10,880
random string

3675
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:12,319
well the cover and a common reference

3676
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:16,240
string both valid

3677
02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:20,160
wonderful this is plan b

3678
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:20,160
i think we'll go for tlas for 400.

3679
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:24,399
there is plan b again

3680
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,240
data encryption mechanism it's not a

3681
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:33,438
question

3682
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:35,039
oh what is no no no no no we continue

3683
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:36,479
with the a-team

3684
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:38,080
what is the deterministic encryption

3685
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:43,119
mechanism

3686
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:46,800
oh no no no

3687
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:52,319
yes per yes per we can pick our time

3688
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:52,319
this is team me what is data encryption

3689
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:55,840
mechanism

3690
02:35:59,510 --> 02:36:04,710
[Laughter]

3691
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:10,720
yes but this was so somewhat close but

3692
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:13,680
it was not it

3693
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:14,640
so who did google i've been so close

3694
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:18,720
several times

3695
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:18,720
come on give me points for this one it's

3696
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:23,840
um

3697
02:36:25,410 --> 02:36:29,840
[Music]

3698
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:32,640
data encapsulation mechanism that's it

3699
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:34,319
encapsulation the magic word it's i just

3700
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:38,080
can't believe we've got 100 people

3701
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:42,000
shouting at us encapsulation

3702
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:44,880
that's that's

3703
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,880
the item again

3704
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:51,840
hey

3705
02:36:53,359 --> 02:37:05,840
yes i think we're gonna go for um output

3706
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:05,840
for 300.

3707
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,319
i see the a-team but i let the others

3708
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:12,319
think a little bit anyway

3709
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:19,840
i mean i would google it tell but i'm

3710
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:19,840
too funny

3711
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:27,920
who is the authors

3712
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:30,720
of the paper of how to explain

3713
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,439
something to your kids yeah something

3714
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:34,160
wait

3715
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:36,319
zero knowledge proofs to your kids wait

3716
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:39,039
i raised my hand

3717
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:40,080
i know zero knowledge yes but 18 was

3718
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:43,920
first

3719
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:43,920
with the hand raising and the answer is

3720
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:49,200
correct

3721
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:51,438
that was wait a second this was for

3722
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:54,640
teammate

3723
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,640
and teammate continues

3724
02:37:55,359 --> 02:38:00,000
uh wait wait i need to lower some ends

3725
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:02,399
so the atm is leading note

3726
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,840
that it might be a good strategy for the

3727
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:06,160
other teams to just

3728
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:07,200
hit the button without even seeing the

3729
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:10,319
the term

3730
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:14,000
by the way i have to tell you that

3731
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:17,279
in the jeopardy when ibm played that ken

3732
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,319
jennings and uh whatever his name ratner

3733
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:21,920
or something

3734
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:24,720
um they were killed by the fact that the

3735
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:26,960
computer just buzzed in much faster in

3736
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:29,840
fact it's really hard to buzz

3737
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:29,839
i've learned now

3738
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:37,040
behind actually so we need to pick a

3739
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:38,960
question or can you pick a question

3740
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,720
meetings beforehand wait a second my

3741
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:41,919
time shall we continue or

3742
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:44,640
do we have a break with more

3743
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:44,640
presentations

3744
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:52,240

kong right or

3757
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:36,000
uh that's not a question

3758
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:39,840
no no category flagship

3759
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:43,680

i give you not more than five seconds

3765
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:57,119
five four what's secure multi-party

3766
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:57,119
competition

3767
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:03,920
let's try is that is that finally

3768
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:03,920
the answer

3769
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:07,119
can

3770
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:16,039
[Music]

3771
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:20,800
that is the correct answer wonderful

3772
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:24,800
plan b

3773
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:29,519
gets rachel my zoom crashed but i'm back

3774
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:29,519
oh oh my gosh okay so

3775
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:39,520
let's partition the the graph

3776
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:43,920
tla 500 please no don't do that

3777
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:43,920
npc that has to be on pc now yeah

3778
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:03,840
me

3779
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,880
i give you 10 seconds this time to

3780
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,880
google it

3781
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:17,840
you almost said it

3782
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:23,680
bounded error probabilistic polynomial

3783
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:35,039
it is not a question

3784
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:35,359
oh no it's over now so the next one is

3785
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:39,200
uh

3786
02:41:35,359 --> 02:41:42,479
plan b please oh

3787
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:44,319
what is thank you jasper what is the

3788
02:41:42,479 --> 02:41:47,358
bounded ever probabilistic

3789
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:55,519
polynomial time so correct

3790
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:56,840
look at that it's amazing that is the

3791
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:01,359
next

3792
02:41:56,840 --> 02:42:01,359
cell 500 please

3793
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:06,000
yes actually there's zoom there

3794
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:16,240
i let everybody think a bit but i do see

3795
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:19,199
the a team again leading

3796
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:19,199
so 18 please

3797
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:24,479
what is the thing is that there are two

3798
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:24,880
names for that so i will go with left

3799
02:42:24,479 --> 02:42:28,160
right

3800
02:42:24,880 --> 02:42:32,560
in this distinguishability versus

3801
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:32,560
also what is the random oracle thingy

3802
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:35,679
thank you come on

3803
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:41,840
let's leave it to that you don't

3804
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:41,840
understand

3805
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:47,840
like i have this power this was not a

3806
02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:49,599
good answer

3807
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:51,200
i would subtract 100 points for this

3808
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:55,359
this was just i

3809
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:55,840
voted my hand i raised my hand is it our

3810
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:58,880
turn

3811
02:42:55,840 --> 02:43:01,920
i i raised on my hand too yes but

3812
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:02,800
the b plan b was first all right so our

3813
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:06,240
turn

3814
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:09,438
ah what is interference ability

3815
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,439
look what is in this

3816
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:15,920

this is if

3819
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:24,960
this is a 500 plus there we are

3820
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:24,960
oh it's getting close steven

3821

let's make it

3837
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:54,800
multi-party computation

3838
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:56,080
i i don't understand a word so what is

3839

02:44:56,080 --> 02:45:01,840
pictionary for 400. like this one

3841
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:06,960
tell her how to end up since one minute

3842
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:06,960
time

3843
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:17,920
so to me me please no

3844
02:45:14,399 --> 02:45:17,920
yes for do you know what it is

3845
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:26,399
i it's symmetric around the x-axis just

3846
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:26,399
go for the first symmetrical

3847
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:29,840
noise

3848
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:43,840
i give you 20 seconds

3849
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:48,560
you understand this is so painful

3850
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:52,080
reverse

3851
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:54,840
image search you can just capture this

3852
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:57,840
picture it's what the is it i mean

3853
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,840
i

3854
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:02,160
google for icr ticks and then you will

3855
02:46:00,479 --> 02:46:04,560
get to the page with all the figures

3856
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:09,920
that they probably took it from

3857
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:10,399
yeah yeah and this is finitely many only

3858
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:12,560
oh

3859
02:46:10,399 --> 02:46:13,599
oh could the audience i'm gonna ask the

3860
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:15,359
audience

3861
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:18,319
oh yeah yeah that's the audience go

3862
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:21,359
ahead go ahead

3863
02:46:18,319 --> 02:46:24,960
hey answer it already did someone put

3864
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:24,960
the answers

3865
02:46:30,479 --> 02:46:34,319
right so this sounds correct but

3866
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:36,160
unfortunately

3867
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:39,600
this time the right answer is

3868
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:39,600
multi-party competition

3869
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:47,680
what is this set of points

3870
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:54,000
and so on and so on so this was jasper

3871
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:56,720
500 points oh yes but you should have

3872
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,720
tried this earlier

3873
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:08,000
yeah oh i can output 500.

3874
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:11,760
you will freak out jasper you're going

3875
02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:15,119
to generate a blue

3876
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:16,080
box no i don't know you should lower

3877
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:19,439
your hand

3878
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:21,840
you break me lower your hand and put it

3879
02:47:19,439 --> 02:47:21,840
up again

3880
02:47:22,399 --> 02:47:30,240
what is the random oracle model

3881
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:30,240
this category is crypto papers

3882
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:37,439
a disc one of a hundred they have a

3883
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:37,439
hundred papers

3884
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,960
i think it's a random occurrence

3885
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:43,600
actually they have five hundred papers

3886
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:43,599
i'm sure

3887
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:47,760

no uh i i let you resolve it but let's

3905
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:03,039
give it five more seconds for the mimi

3906
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:05,520

3908
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:07,920
don't have my hand up i don't know the

3909
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:12,880
paper

3910
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:15,920
um i raised my hand before the question

3911
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:18,160
okay i would have time to answer it

3912
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:19,680
the question is what is tweakable wait

3913
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:21,520
wait wait wait wait wait wait no no no

3914
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:24,560
no no no the 18 was much faster

3915
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:26,720
all hands went down when i was like

3916
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:29,199
that cannot be the case because i raised

3917
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:31,519
my hand before the question

3918
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:32,399
yeah yes and then i asked everybody to

3919
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:35,439
lower the hand

3920
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:37,840
and then i waited and i raised it again

3921
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:38,880
i opened the question of this item when

3922
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:44,080
all

3923
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:44,080
hands went down i think it is the a-team

3924
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:50,000
or don't fail sorry we wrote tweakable

3925
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:52,840
block ciphers

3926
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:55,840
tweakable block ciphers this sounds very

3927
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:55,840
good

3928
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:06,319
and this is a 18 winning with 3

3929
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:10,479
900 points over plan b with 2

3930
02:50:06,319 --> 02:50:10,479
900 and a third follower

3931

3946
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:57,760
was a genius idea whoever came with that

3947
