00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:11,120
i'm tim healy i'm going to talk about

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,120
celebration revelations

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
this work is joined with his diversion

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,960
for one new year

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
and no serious delays

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
firstly i will call some background

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,198
online

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,479
similarly i will use

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,760
my god suddenly i want to

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:45,839
show you any ideas

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:45,839
finally i will make our conclusion

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,640
is l if the read n is greater than 2

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
then that l has infinitely many basis

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,840
in lattice theory the most important

16
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,839
problem is

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,759
which is called the first minimum of the

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
lens

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,839
there are two natural reactions

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,839
l denotes the determinant of l

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
is

22
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
is

23
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,680
have been constructed whose security is

24
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,319
based on the western countries of n

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
o n to c s c for some country

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,319
for example mr pqc loans three

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,879
submissions

28
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,879
include some language-based schemes

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:34,640
how to do how to do less analysis

30
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,319
furthermore how to estimate the concrete

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,518
security of related

32
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,518
polygraphic diseases

33
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,079
the answer is we just need to solve and

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,079
to see ascp and to see

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
to do so the cancer approach

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
asked us is find a good basis consisting

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
of reasonably

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,920
short and almost original factors

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,120
for example in the in this figure given

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,119
basis v1 v2 we try to define the release

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:29,840
and almost

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
ladies and gentlemen is very important

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
because

44
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
it

45
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,800
[Music]

46
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,198
and is notably incredible tourism

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,479
is our portfolio to both having a key

48
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,440
choreography and

49
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
criminal nations its importance is

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639
growing

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
because let this graduality become the

52
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
most popular candidate

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,719
for pqc

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
one of the fundamentalist parameters in

55
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,840
the

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
numbers is constant government

57
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
is

58
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,619
[Music]

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
is

60
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
is

61
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,470
[Music]

62
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,849
[Music]

63
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
foreign

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
out to one oven and the number one is

65
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
also less than

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
two times one over k minus one

67
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,400
times

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
let us look mere acceleration with

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
communications

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
yes

71
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,240
the ratio of the number one over

72
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
here

73
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
i think we need to ask the following two

74
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,639
questions first

75
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,330
can we expand that

76
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:48,519
he may not develop

77
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,519
[Music]

78
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
uh

79
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
svp

80
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,069
[Music]

81
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:54,959
interval between one over two and one

82
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:54,959
however there is

83
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,689
[Music]

84
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
to solve the three questions we have two

85
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:45,839
main results

86
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:51,839
or to say two letters always

87
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,839
for opposition with

88
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,209
[Music]

89
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,839
k to um

90
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:33,839
this is

91
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
to see

92
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
is

93
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,759
[Music]

94
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
is

95
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:11,839
data to c plus one and into c

96
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:11,839
and together and over c plus one

97
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
is

98
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
foreign

99
00:12:48,880 --> 00:13:07,839
yeah you can read these two tables

100
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:07,839
for all

101
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,839
okay so now

102
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
i want to show you all the ideas

103
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,839
for strategy i just uh

104
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,839
notions

105
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,480
each vector b i star equal to pi i

106
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:58,600
or b i is equal to the value of b

107
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,240
we use b i g is the projected product

108
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,240
pi plus one

109
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:17,839
now i introduce some several reductions

110
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,839
we will use

111
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
is

112
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,519
so that the photograph has a smaller

113
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,880
ring and masking and the second block

114
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:27,839
has a green key

115
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:27,839
and assuming the falling pj

116
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,720
such that the highly expensive b1 to bk

117
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,839
become good enough that's

118
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,279
the b12 to the fully

119
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,279
uh increase

120
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,869
finally we do

121
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,869
[Music]

122
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
is

123
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
foreign

124
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
is

125
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:19,839
in the future

126
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
is

127
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
is

128
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
okay

129
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,080
for chronography ib is useful

130
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,080
in less security

131
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,679
for more details please refer to our

132
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,280
paper

133
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,280
thank you attention
