00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,439
my name is fukang leo the title of this

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,719
talk is

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
automatic verification of differential

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,759
characteristics

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
application to reduce the gimli this is

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
a joint work with takanoli isobe and the

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,000
videomail

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
as we know nistana is holding a

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
lightweight cryptography competition and

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
there are 32 candidates selected for the

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
second round

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,359
obviously the third-party crypto

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
analysis

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,320
is necessary to understand the security

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,440
of these candidates

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,800
second since ketchuk was selected as the

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,480
xia3 standard

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,959
more and more permutation based

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,959
primitives have been proposed as can be

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
seen from the submissions

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
to nista's lightweight cryptocurrency

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,680
competition

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,480
with the development of the automatic

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,840
search for differential characteristics

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,078
finding a suitable differential

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,320
characteristic

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
is reduced to constructing a model

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,360
describing the difference transitions

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,920
however earth can be seen in most models

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,840
the difference transitions over runs are

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
treated as

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,960
independent while such an assumption

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
is reasonable for block cipher it may

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,559
not hold for a

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
public permutation as there is no wrong

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
key

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
therefore it is natural to question the

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,839
validity

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
of the differential characteristics

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,119
obtained with such an

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,320
automatic method we can also learn some

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
lessons from the literature specifically

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
some differential characteristics of

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,240
sha-2 black skin

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
are shown to be inconsistent

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,039
to solve the contradictions in

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
sha-2 characteristics mendel at all

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,399
developed a dedicated

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,320
search method the main idea is to search

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
the differential characteristics and the

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,000
conforming message pair at the same time

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,279
for scan florent also developed a

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
dedicated searching

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
algorithm where the contradictions are

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,840
avoided by using the improved

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,238
generalized conditions so similar to the

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,959
introduction of

59
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,040
milp into the crypto analysis

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,480
we would like to know whether it is

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,599
possible to use the

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
of the shift servers to deal with the

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,519
contradictions

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,400
occurring in their differential

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,519
characteristics

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,599
we are inspired from mendeleev's work

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,599
on chat two characteristics so our aim

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,920
is to construct a model

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,359
capturing both the different transitions

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
and value transitions

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:55,120
at the same time the technical part

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,120
is how to connect the two transitions

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,040
our target is skinny the game needs a

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
cross-platform permutation designed by

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,799
bursting at all

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
and it is now included in the second

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
round candidates

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,000
in nist's lightweight cryptography

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,680
competition

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,159
most importantly as

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
we may observed the diffusion of the

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,640
gimli run function

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,519
is rather slow so

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,599
intuitively there is a high chance for

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,840
the differential characteristic of the

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,839
gimli permutation to be

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
embedded

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
so first of all let me give a brief

89
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,359
description of gimli

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
the gimli state is organized as a three

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
times four

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
two dimensional array the total number

93
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
of runs

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,760
of the gimli permutation is 24 and the

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
sequence of operations for the 24 round

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,239
permutation

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,640
is listed here so you can see that

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
the sequence of operations every four

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
runs are identical

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
so in the first round the linear

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,599
operation

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,640
sp then the linear

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,560
operating small swap and the constant

104
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,560
operation everyone constant will be

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
applied in the second round

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
only sp will be applied in the third

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,479
round

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,680
sp and another linear operation big swap

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,080
will be applied

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
in the first round again only xp will be

111
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,840
applied

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,840
so now let me give a description

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,758
what sp is so for sp

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,719
it will apply a 96 bit sp box

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,840
to the four columns of the gimli step in

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
parallel

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,119
we can denote the improved and output of

118
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,758
the sp

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,040
works by x ioiz and ox oroz

120
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,479
in this way the relations between i x

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,280
i y i z and o x o l z

122
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,080
can be specified here so you can see

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
that the algebraic degree of the s p box

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
is two

125
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
and you can also observe that each

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,520
output bits only

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,520
depends on at most 4 input bits

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,159
now let me describe the linear

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,600
operations

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
small swap and the big smoke so you can

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
see

132
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,440
the illustration from this figure

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,240
so you can see that they are very simple

134
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
it is just

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
a permutation on the state words on the

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
first

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,239
row of the gimli state so very

138
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,080
simple right since

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,240
our m2 is to construct a model to

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,320
describe the different transitions and

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,680
value transitions

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,800
the linear operations is just

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,960
a permutation on bits so

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:10,880
uh let us uh

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,039
in the model the linear operation

146
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,400
can only affect the order of the

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360
variables

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,440
so let us focus on the model for the sp

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
box

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
you can see from the specification of

151
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,719
the sp box that

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,520
uh the expressions of

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
the output bit can be divided into four

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960
types

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
two tabs are linear functions and the

156
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,198
two types are

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
nonlinear functions

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,319
for the two linear functions

159
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,720
we can find that the difference and the

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,720
value

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
the difference transitions and the value

162
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
transitions are independent

163
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,919
and they are not related however for the

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,120
type 2 expression

165
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,840
there is a non-linear operator and so

166
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,440
there will be relations between the

167
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,080
difference and the value

168
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,599
specifically there will always be a

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,639
constraint on the value

170
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
for a non-zero very different uh

171
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,599
difference transition

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,120
so as you can see from

173
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,039
from it similarly for the type 4

174
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
expression there is a non-linear

175
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,240
operator all

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,359
and we can also find that for

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
each non-zero value the difference

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
transition

179
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,520
there will always be a constraint on the

180
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
value

181
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,360
so the memory then

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,520
y so the main reason why the difference

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
and the value are related

184
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,000
is due to the non-linear operation so

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,000
let us discuss

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,840
how to model the uh difference

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,160
uh the relations between the difference

188
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,599
and the value inside the non-linear

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
operator

190
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,840
but first let's add let us consider the

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,199
end operation

192
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,400
we can construct a choose table for the

193
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,240
tuple a0

194
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,679
a1 a0 a1 and delta a2

195
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,080
so let's e as list as shown

196
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:26,720
here and we can uh

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:31,919
you ah and we can use sage and and

198
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,760
greedy algorithm to find the equivalent

199
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,799
linear inequalities to describe such a

200
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
truth table

201
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,519
so the linear inequalities

202
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,959
are shown here similarly for the all

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,399
operation we can

204
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,839
compute the corresponding equivalent

205
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,680
linear inequalities to describe the

206
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,399
relations between the difference

207
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,399
and value

208
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,000
so next let us discuss how to model the

209
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,360
value transitions

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
similarly we can construct a choose

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,519
table for

212
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,360
the input and output

213
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,040
and then calculate the corresponding

214
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,680
linear inequalities so since there are

215
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,399
expressions for the type 1 since the

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,359
type 1 and

217
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
type 2 expressions are simple we do not

218
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,440
discuss them

219
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
we only focus on how to uh we only

220
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
introduce

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,200
the model that we only introduce the

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,279
linear inequalities for the type 2

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,920
expression and type 4 expression

224
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,959
so very simple that's shown here

225
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,279
so this is the linear inequalities for

226
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,199
the

227
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,920
type 4 expression then we need to model

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,000
the difference transitions

229
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,839
we also omit the models for the type 1

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
and type 2 expressions as they are

231
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,839
simple

232
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,719
uh for the type 3 and type 4 expressions

233
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
we can

234
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,360
introduce two intermediate variables and

235
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,680
a zero and a one

236
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
to represent the output difference of

237
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,920
the

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,000
nonlinear operation respectively

239
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,360
in this way on the

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,079
the problem is reduced to constructing a

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,279
model describing the expression

242
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,959
a c equals a zero plus

243
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,200
a one plus a two and we can

244
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,079
simply write the corresponding linear

245
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
inequalities

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,120
now let me discuss how to uh connect the

247
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,719
two transitions

248
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
let us focus on the type three

249
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,480
expression first

250
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,399
we use the linear inequality system to

251
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,640
describe the relations of

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,839
a0 a1 a2 a3 and a4 which corresponds to

253
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,079
their

254
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,040
value transitions then let us use the

255
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,239
linear inequality system one to describe

256
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,279
the relations of

257
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,320
a2 h3 dot a2 dot io3

258
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:14,000
and n80 which corresponds

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,240
to the relations between

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,440
the difference and the value

261
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
finally we can describe the relations of

262
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
data a0

263
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,439
a1 and a0 3a4

264
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
using the equality system the inequality

265
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,240
system five

266
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,439
in this way we construct the

267
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
difference transitions uh value

268
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
transitions

269
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,320
and the connections between the two

270
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,920
transitions for the type 2 expression

271
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,550
similarly we can do the same things for

272
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
the type 4 expression

273
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,959
[Music]

274
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,199
so now we have constructed the model to

275
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,560
capture both the difference transitions

276
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
and the value transitions

277
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,040
based on this model we can detect

278
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,720
contradictions for a specified

279
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,839
differential characteristic

280
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,680
specifically given a specified

281
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
differential characteristic

282
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,120
the variables representing the

283
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
difference are fixed

284
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,800
so the quantity system is only in terms

285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
of the variables

286
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,359
representing the values

287
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,199
if the quality system is infeatable

288
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,160
then the given differential

289
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,519
characteristics

290
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
the the given differential

291
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,600
characteristic is obviously invalid

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,800
if the inequality system is feasible

293
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,160
and the solver outputs a solution for it

294
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,719
then the conforming values for the

295
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,839
differential characteristic

296
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
are found

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
so the feature of our model is that the

298
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
relations between the different

299
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
transitions and the value transitions

300
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,600
are actually

301
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,279
written in the constraints therefore

302
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,079
it can bring us some benefits

303
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,760
first one is that given a specified

304
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,239
differential characteristic

305
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,720
the whole inequality system is only in

306
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
terms of the variables representing the

307
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
value

308
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,320
so we only need to consider the value

309
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200
transitions

310
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
second we can use it to find a

311
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,399
compatible differential characteristic

312
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,160
for the dense part

313
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
of the clean generating differential

314
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,199
characteristic

315
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,200
where contradictions are easier to occur

316
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,399
we applied our model to the gimli

317
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,920
permutation

318
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,560
first we use that

319
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,959
to verify some existing differential

320
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,079
characteristics

321
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,319
of the gimli permutation we found that

322
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
the official pair front differential

323
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
characteristic

324
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,920
is invalid in a gimli document we also

325
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,279
found that

326
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,240
the sixth one differential

327
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:13,680
characteristic for cleaning attack

328
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,680
is embedded in a gimp in any print paper

329
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,719
apart from verification we also use our

330
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,800
model to search for a valid differential

331
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
characteristic

332
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,319
specifically we follow the different

333
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,199
patterns

334
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
used in a print paper used in the

335
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,839
imprint paper

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,680
and try to stop and try to search for a

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,639
valid difference uh try to search for a

338
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,079
valid differential characteristic

339
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,399
let me slightly let me give a brief

340
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,199
a description of the difference pattern

341
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,240
so for

342
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,800
the difference between the first

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,760
column and the third column are the same

344
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
and the difference between the

345
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,319
second column and the first column are

346
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
the same

347
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,439
we can construct a probability one

348
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,720
differential characteristic

349
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,240
in the last two runs in this way

350
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,399
the improved of our model

351
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,519
can be illustrated uh by this figure

352
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,480
and we hope the solver can output a

353
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,639
solution

354
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,759
for the question marks

355
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,519
and these are the constraints used to

356
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,959
ensure the difference patterns

357
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,360
to further reduce their search space

358
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,839
we also constrain the harming weight of

359
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,199
dot s3

360
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,120
in this way we found

361
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,399
a valid six round differential

362
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,839
characteristic

363
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,320
as well as its corresponding message

364
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,440
pair

365
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:04,959
uh this is done in on a standard pc

366
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,959
and takes about four hours

367
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,680
and these are the differential

368
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,199
conditions implied in the differential

369
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,040
characteristic

370
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,040
so here and here

371
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
however the conforming message pairs are

372
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,719
just a

373
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,759
semi-free start clean we want to

374
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,519
which is less meaningful so we want to

375
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,519
uh convert the semi-freestyle cleans

376
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,720
into cleans our idea is to enumerate

377
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,800
other solutions specifying the

378
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
sixth run differential characteristic

379
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,519
and using extra

380
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,000
message blocks to connect one of the

381
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,000
solution

382
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,800
so first we try to merge the conditions

383
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,839
specifically we convert

384
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,880
partial conditions on s2 into conditions

385
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,759
on s1

386
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,640
in this way the number of conditions on

387
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,160
s1

388
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,959
will be 6 1. this will allows us to

389
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
exhaust

390
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
all possible values of the second column

391
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,959
of

392
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:20,720
s1 as they are only in total 2 to the

393
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:25,360
35 values then

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,360
we can find that there are in total 1632

395
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:32,240
solutions for the second

396
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:35,520
column of s1 then we try to

397
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,360
calculate the solutions for the

398
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,440
last two rows of the second column of s0

399
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,360
similarly we use one property of the sp

400
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,799
box to reduce the

401
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,320
time complexity and can find that

402
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,360
and can enumerate the

403
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,399
all the solutions for the last two rows

404
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,439
of the second column of s0

405
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,720
in this way we can calculate the

406
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,000
probability of a valid capacity part

407
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,120
i mean so the probability that

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,400
the last two rows of the of s0

409
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,199
are valid so the protocol

410
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,960
so the total probability is 2 to the

411
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,360
minus 127.6

412
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,520
so without any specific strategy

413
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,879
the time complexity to convert a

414
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:38,080
semi-free start

415
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,080
clean into clean is 2 to the 127.6

416
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,240
indeed with a divide and conquer method

417
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,399
we can convert the

418
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:52,160
we can use we can find a message block

419
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,080
to match one of the mean uh

420
00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:00,559
solutions in time complexity 2

421
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,280
to the 64 and memory complexity 2 to the

422
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,280
64.

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,640
when we wonder that why we need to

424
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,160
calculate the probability in this way

425
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
this is because the difference

426
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,919
transitions over different runs are not

427
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
independent

428
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,200
so we shouldn't calculate the

429
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,760
probability for a differential

430
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,520
characteristic

431
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
by counting the number of their

432
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,960
different of their

433
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,000
conditions i may also wonder

434
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,559
why the dependencies influenced in my

435
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
opinion

436
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,840
there are three points first there is no

437
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,960
one key

438
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,799
second the diffusion of the linear

439
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,919
layer is rather weak and last

440
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:51,360
the expressions of the sp box

441
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,760
is rather simple the expressions of the

442
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,799
sp

443
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,440
box are very simple so you can see that

444
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,120
one output bit depends on at the most

445
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,240
four input bits

446
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,639
and the algebraic degree of the sp

447
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:10,720
box is two and for each

448
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,760
and for the express for each

449
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,200
for the expression uh for each

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,039
non-linear operation

451
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,159
for for each for each non-linear

452
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,960
expression of one output bits

453
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,559
there are there is only one quadratic

454
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,200
term

455
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,200
so these are the three reasons

456
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,760
we think influence the dependency

457
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,039
of the different transitions so in

458
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,879
conclusion

459
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
the risk for a differential

460
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
characteristic of a public permutation

461
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,039
to be invalid

462
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
is high as there is no running key the

463
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,919
diffusion and

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
confusion will also influence the

465
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,559
dependency

466
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,520
as a result we need to take care of the

467
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,600
probability

468
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,000
of a differential characteristic for a

469
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,760
public permutation

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,760
that's all thank you
