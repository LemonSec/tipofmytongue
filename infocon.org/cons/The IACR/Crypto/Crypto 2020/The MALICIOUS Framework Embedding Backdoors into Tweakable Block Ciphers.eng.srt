00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,439
hi everyone i'm how young wong i'm here

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,759
to present our crypto paper

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,000
the malicious framework embedding back

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,840
doors into tweakable block ciphers

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
this is a drawing work with thomas

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
parent

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,279
when people hear about a door of an

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,359
encryption system

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
most of the time it refers to those

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,920
weakness intentionally created

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
in the implementation level such as

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,640
protocols of case management

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,198
and key escrow another type of a

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
backdoor is a cryptographic backdoor

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,079
it is embedded during the design phase

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
of a cryptographic algorithm

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,920
however there are very few known

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,760
examples of such backdoor

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,559
algorithm used in reality here are two

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,680
examples

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,000
the first one is a dual ec it is a

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
pseudo-random number generator designed

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
by

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,559
nsa it has been verified by snowden

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,199
and many other researchers that it has a

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,000
back door

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
inside the second example is the two

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
algorithm

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,840
kucinichic and the street book which are

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
selected as russian standards

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
their xbox was proved to have a special

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
structure

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,240
which was not claimed by the designer so

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,119
it might be a backdoor but has not been

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
verified yet

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
in academic research there are also

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,880
limited number of works

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,600
focusing on this topic and unfortunately

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,640
almost all designs were either broken or

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,798
cannot provide solid security proof

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
in this work we try to make some

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
progress in this research field

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,000
firstly we propose a malicious framework

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
to impact back doors

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
into tweakable block ciphers then we

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
show that

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
our backdoors is efficient which means

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
that if you know the backdoor

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,039
you can easily recover the secret key

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,600
used in any communicate communications

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,799
we also provide a concrete security bond

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,880
for our back door

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,840
so that it is difficult for any

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,880
anniversary to recover the back door

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,920
lastly we provide a cipher example

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
called blue mcm based on this framework

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,399
and

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,399
give security proof of this cipher

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
now i will explain the malicious

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,399
framework

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
this framework uses three essential

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
components

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,239
the first one is tweakable block ciphers

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,079
compared to a block cipher

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,520
a tweak book block cipher has an

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
additional input

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,760
tweak in order to select the permutation

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,280
computed by the cipher

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
even if the k is fixed for the usage of

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,519
tweak there's no

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,160
need to keep the tweak secret so that an

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
attacker could know the exact value of

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
the tweak

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
used in that encryption even more the

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
attacker could have full

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
control of the tweak such that he can

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,959
choose whatever value he wants of the

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
tweak

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,200
this attack scenario is also called

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
chosen tweak scenario

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
the second component is partial

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,519
nonlinear layers

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
in block ciphers when designing a block

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,800
cipher

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,679
one of the most popular method is a

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,200
substitution permutation network

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
each spn run will consist a linear layer

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
and a non-linear layer operating on the

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
internal state

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
partial nonlinear layer is a special

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
case of

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,159
spn where the non-linear layer is only

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
applied

94
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,798
to subpart of the of the internal state

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,720
so for xbox based block cipher a part of

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
the state will bypass the

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
s boxes in each round and only goes

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,679
through the linear layers

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,480
as shown in this picture

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
for typical ciphers xoro is the first

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
block cipher adopts

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
this structure but it has been broken

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,359
shortly after its publication

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,798
but this doesn't mean this structure is

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
not secure

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,239
later a family of a block cipher low mc

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,319
is proposed where the non-linear layer

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,799
science can be said arbitrarily

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,798
and this cipher remains secure so far

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
the last one is the extendable output

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
functions

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,159
and xof is a generalization of a hash

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
function

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,440
which maps an arbitrary lens input to an

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,638
arbitrary lens output

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,400
and xof can also be used as a classical

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,520
hash function by setting the

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,400
output lens fixed a good

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,120
xof has to satisfy the security notions

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
such as

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
escalation resistance premature

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,520
resistance and

123
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,400
second premature resistance there are

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,440
not too many

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,000
xof algorithms the typical ones are

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,880
shake 128 and shake 256

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
they are defined in the shastry standard

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,840
and later we'll use them to build

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,560
concrete instances

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,679
this is a malicious framework it is used

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
to build a key

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,039
ordinating tweakable block ciphers in

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
each run

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,680
a sub key and a sub tweak will be added

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
to the internal state

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,039
the key schedule is not specified and

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
can be any appropriate algorithm

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,400
the framework has two special features

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
the first one

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,799
is that the wrong function is composed

141
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,080
of a linear layer and a partial

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
nonlinear layer

143
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,639
secondly the tweak schedule is selected

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,199
sof the concentration of all the sub

145
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,160
tweaks

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,320
is the output of the xof one can

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
instantiate the framework with any

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,120
components he wants but

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,960
in order to embed vectors some specific

150
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,199
steps has to be followed

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,198
till now you may still wonder what kind

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,320
of backdoor can be embedded

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,000
inside this framework the answer

154
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,960
is related tweak differential

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,520
characteristic with probability one

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,039
with the knowledge of this in attack one

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
could recover the secret key

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,639
in one second this picture

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
illustrates the basic pattern of the one

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
run characteristic

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,479
the block represent the difference of

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
the internal state

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
the hashed blocks are non-zero

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,280
difference while the white blocks

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,039
are zero difference as we can see the

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,119
subtweet difference delta t

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
minus one introduced by the tweak

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
addition operation

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
cancels the difference of a part of the

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
internal state

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,599
so that the part going through the

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,199
subsequent non-linear layer

173
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,880
will be zero difference based on this

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,000
principle we can extend such

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,560
characteristic to

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,759
enough number of rounds for an attack

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
however

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,240
this differential characteristic cannot

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,800
be used by any external energy

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
because it can only be triggered by a

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,080
certain tweak pair

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,359
we call it the malicious twig pair

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,120
and it also should be kept secret by the

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,919
decipher designer

185
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,759
accordingly the tag using the back door

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,758
is under the chosen tweak scenario

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
now i will explain how to build the

188
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,758
backdoor firstly

189
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
we should choose a pair of tweaks and

190
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
keep it secret

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,960
and this is a malicious trick bear next

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
for boost of the tweak compute a sub

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,198
tweaks by the

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,318
choosing xof and then simply exodus

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,160
to obtain the sub tweak differences

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
the next step is to generate the

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
differential characteristic

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,799
and the linear layers firstly select the

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,639
plaintext difference delta p

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
as the input difference of the

201
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,360
differential characteristic to be

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,520
generated

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,599
but with the requirement that the

204
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
difference of this non-linear part

205
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,280
should be equal to the difference of the

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,919
non-linear part of the first

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,080
subtweet difference this is illustrated

208
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,758
in the picture in the left side

209
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
then we just need to generate a

210
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
different characteristic one by round

211
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
by selecting an appropriate linear layer

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,840
of each round

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,080
it's a requirement that after the linear

214
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
layer the difference of the non-linear

215
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,318
part of the state can be neutralized by

216
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
the next subtweet difference

217
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,879
as shown in the picture in the right

218
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
side the remaining components of the

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
cipher

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,560
such as the xbox and the k addition

221
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,919
don't affect the different

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,800
characteristics

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,960
and the specification of this component

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,919
should be determined to ensure

225
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
the overall cyber security we also know

226
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,639
that

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,239
it is possible to embed multiple such

228
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
differential characteristics

229
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
by just selecting other plaintext

230
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,840
differences and adding

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,840
extra constraint to the linear layers

232
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,880
now i will explain the bacterial

233
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,279
security of the malicious framework

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
firstly let me introduce a security

235
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
notion

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
target difference resistance its

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
definition

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
is as follows a hash function h is

239
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,680
target different resistant

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,920
if it is hard to find two input x and y

241
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:02,160
such that h x x or h y equal to delta

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,319
where delta is a non-zero constant

243
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
this notion is similar to the classic

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
calculation resistance of a hash

245
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
function

246
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,319
where delta equal to zero and complexity

247
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
is also the same as that of the

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
collision resistance

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,719
that is a birthday bond two to the power

250
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
of

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
n over two n is a length of the hash

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
value

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
the target different resistance

254
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,120
naturally applies to

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
xof as xof is also a kind of a hash

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,000
function

257
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,640
in terms of a shake 128 its security

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
strength

259
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,080
against the attack is a minimal value of

260
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
n over 2

261
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
and 128 and the security strings can be

262
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,720
doubled for

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,160
shake 256. now i will show that

264
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,240
the back door is protected by the xof

265
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,680
assume that even if the embedded

266
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,640
differential characteristic

267
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,599
is publicly known that is a plaintext

268
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,760
difference

269
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
the internal state differences and the

270
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,680
subtweet differences

271
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
are known finding the malicious tweak

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,560
pair is still difficult

273
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
actually this task is equivalent to

274
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,800
solving the target difference problem

275
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,720
of the xof as shown in this equation

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,319
given the string of the subject

277
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,760
differences the target

278
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,720
of the attacker is to solve the equation

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,720
to find the malicious tweak pair

280
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
and if the length of the sub tweak

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
string is long enough

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,560
the complexity can be 2 to the power 128

283
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:38,399
for shake 128 and to the power of 2 456

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,399
for shake 256

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
actually there might exist other

286
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,000
backdoors in the framework

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
since we did not fix the tweak length as

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
long as the attacker can find a tweaked

289
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,000
pair whose output difference

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,599
is the subject differences he will

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
discover a backdoor

292
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
even if this is not embedded

293
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
intentionally

294
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
moreover it is also possible that there

295
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
is a suitable tweak pair for

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,800
randomly given differential

297
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,199
characteristic that is

298
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,719
the sub tweak differences can be any

299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,120
given value

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
all of these tweak pairs will imply new

301
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,399
backdoors

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
which are not intentionally embedded

303
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
however

304
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,519
finding these backdoors is still as hard

305
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
as finding the originally embedded

306
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,079
backdoor

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
in the next i will explain a concrete

308
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,560
instantiation of the malicious framework

309
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,040
which is named low mcm

310
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,119
blue mcm is a family of a tweakbook

311
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,040
block ciphers derived from the block

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,079
cipher's low mc

313
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,160
compared to lumc it has an additional

314
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,640
tweak addition in each run

315
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,880
and it also uses an optimized

316
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,040
representation where the k

317
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,639
the tweak and the constant are only

318
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,639
added to the non-linear part

319
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,760
of the internal state a single round of

320
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,200
low mcm

321
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,120
is depicted in this picture the size of

322
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
the non-linear layer s

323
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,839
can be set arbitrarily by choosing the

324
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,560
number of s-boxes used in the run

325
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,240
function the linear layer is an

326
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,638
invertible binary matrix

327
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
operating on the full state which is

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
different

329
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,760
in each round and can be chosen randomly

330
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,119
but in order to embed a backdoor inside

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,519
omcm

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
the linear layer matrices has to be

333
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,399
customized

334
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,160
following the building steps of the

335
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,120
malicious framework

336
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,880
lastly tweak schedule used in low mcm is

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,800
shake 128

338
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,920
or ship 256 depending on the expected

339
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,479
security of the backdoor

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,319
we proposed three security notions to

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,279
capture the vector security

342
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
in different aspects accordingly we

343
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,839
proved that

344
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,000
blue mcm has the following security

345
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,079
properties

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,040
firstly blue mcm is undetectable

347
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,239
as i explained an instance of blue mcm

348
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,319
can be generated

349
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
without any backdoors but choose the

350
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,959
linear layers randomly

351
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
or we can generate an instance with a

352
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
backdoor by designing special linear

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
layers

354
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,240
however we show in our paper that the

355
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,719
attacker cannot

356
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,440
detect the distinction between these two

357
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,760
kind of

358
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:25,279
instance secondly the backdoor in umcm

359
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,720
is undiscoverable it is computationally

360
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,360
difficult for the attacker

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
to recover the backdoor this is due to

362
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,720
the target different resistance of the

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,000
xos

364
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,279
lastly but unfortunately our backdoor is

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
traceable

366
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,959
since the tag using the backdoor is a

367
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
chosen tweak attack

368
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,000
and also a chosen plain text attack

369
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,040
because this is a differential attack

370
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,600
once the vector is used in attack it

371
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,319
will reveal the selected tweak values

372
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,560
and plaintext values the entities who

373
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,079
know it can try all the combinations of

374
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,079
them to recover the backdoor

375
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,760
without considering the backdoor the

376
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
cipher is also secure in the classical

377
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
black box model

378
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
we proved in our paper that the security

379
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,839
of low mcm

380
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,519
can be reduced to the security of low mc

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
and currently lmc

382
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
remains very secure since umcm

383
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,839
has an additional tweak we discuss the

384
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,079
security in two aspects

385
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
the first one is attacks without using

386
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,000
the tweak

387
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,800
without considering the tweak blue mcm

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,959
is an equivalent representation of umc

389
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,079
and there's nothing different if no

390
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,359
backdoor is embedded in umcm

391
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,599
even if a low mcm instance is backward

392
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,760
we showed that the customized linear

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
layer matrices can be considered as

394
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,480
independently and randomly chosen from

395
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,800
the wheel of the attacker

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,880
thus the attacker cannot utilize the

397
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,880
special linear layered matrices

398
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,519
to attack the cipher secondly is attack

399
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
based on the tweak since the tweak

400
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,440
schedule is an

401
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,719
xof the attacker can't control its

402
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
output

403
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,480
so the tweak can provide additional

404
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,359
advantage for the attacker

405
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,160
for the future works since we only use

406
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,839
the framework to build block ciphers

407
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,519
can we build other backdoored

408
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,199
cryptography algorithms

409
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,680
such as hash functions and max

410
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
for the usage of the backdoors we only

411
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
apply

412
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
to plane differential attack is there

413
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,758
any other

414
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,000
crypto analysis techniques that works

415
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,800
more efficiently

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,079
lastly since our backdoor is traceable

417
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,479
so how to make it

418
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,638
untraceable so that it can be used

419
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,480
correctly

420
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,279
that's all thank you for watching this

421
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
