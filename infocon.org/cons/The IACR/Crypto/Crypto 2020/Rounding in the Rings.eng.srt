1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,479
all right so hello everyone my name is

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
jordan wang

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,920
i will talk about ranging into rings

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,639
this is a joint work with phone call you

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,480
this is out online first of all i will

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,480
give a quick overview of

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,640
the background then i talked about the

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
little reduction from search ring out

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
there to decision ring

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
finally i will show the new harness

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
results of mojo adapter with leaky

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,439
secret

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
okay let's enter the first part

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,280
our topic is motivated by the

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
post-quantum cryptography

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
and aims to study theoretical

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,600
foundations of post-quantum cryptography

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
so the motivation of of post-quantum

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
cryptography is that

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
most currently in use public key compute

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
system

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
can be broken by large-scale quantum

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
computers

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,280
because the mathematical fundamental

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,920
problems

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,719
such as integer factorization discrete

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,160
logarithm

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,680
ecc at all will be broken by the famous

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,720
short algorithms on quantum computers

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,320
therefore for further security least

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,880
cost for new standards the cryptosystem

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,839
should

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,399
achieve post-quantum security and high

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,720
efficiency simultaneously

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,119
and we know that deployment and new

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,320
standards can take a lot of time

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,280
so we had better start now

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
to achieve this goal one from missing

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,600
directions

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,439
lattice-based cryptography which enjoys

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,240
more focus in pqc uh the

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,600
foundations of landspace cryptography

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,960
other

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,399
hard problems however basic

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,520
lattice problems such as svp or silvp

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
are lawsuits for

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,960
constructing cryptosystems directly

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
in 2005 reagan proposed a hard problem

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,240
according learning with arrows simply

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,320
speaking

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,119
lw aims to find the secrets from many

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,478
noisy inner products of random vector a

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,120
and the sequence

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
or determine the pair a b from random

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
pairs

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,799
the noise uh distributed as a

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
discrete gaussian since since it was

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,280
proposed

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,239
lw draws widely attaches because there

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,160
is a reduction from basic lattice

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
problems to elderly

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
that is to say if the underlying lens

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,400
problem is

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
hard for a quantum computer so is the

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
other b

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,400
and we can design may design many

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,840
advanced cultures from lw such as

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,720
free homomorphic encryption and more

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,599
well it's playing adobe is good enough

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
uh job

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,879
playing adaptably it means elderly is in

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,160
the

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,560
form as we defined defined before and

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,840
actually this is not because of the

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,599
efficiency

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,000
so usually a player b suffers large case

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,040
and the gaussian simply involved in

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
choosing noise

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
its converse sound and the list also did

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
not

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
select then lb based the fraud as

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,159
finalist

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,840
it has a backup alternative

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,840
so what do we need

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
and maybe the so-called yokohu is the

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
answer

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,760
well it is not at the end

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
because we should we should achieve more

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,319
with the so-called

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,040
kai or saber so i will explain

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,518
a little bit more what's a little hook

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,720
or

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
what's the hook so the hope is we need

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
more

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
mathematical structures so what

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
additional

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
mathematical structures can improve

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
efficiency

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,319
we can work in the rings and we can use

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,080
wrongly so what do they mean

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,280
okay instead of working on cq to the air

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
we can work on rq to the k for some ring

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
r

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
and instead of adding errors to the

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
inner product

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,760
we can use running in fact those two

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,200
ideas have been exploited in the list of

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,478
pqc standards

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,358
for example uh w hope and the llc in

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,758
second round

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:26,479
and the kyber and zebra in third round

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,440
however we're working with additional

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
mathematical

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,479
structure may incur further strategies

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,600
for example which ring should be choose

116
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,400
and how to run actually

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
these are exactly the motivations of

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,198
learning with surrounding ovaries

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,599
or ring lwr so we formulate the

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,919
definition of ring algorithm

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,440
which was firstly proposed by benedict

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,960
piker and rosie in traditionally

123
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
in 2012 the ring at the blr is defined

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,880
with

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,240
pyramid pq uh under the ringer

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,280
the surgical problem is to find the

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
sequence from

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,520
given symbols as a pair ap where a

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,919
render element in r q and b equals to

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,320
the rounding of a times s

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
and the running of an element x with

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
respect to p

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,880
q is defined as uh the rounding of p

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
over q times x the marquee

135
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,960
okay so the decision problem is to

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,758
distinguish the pair av

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,719
from uniformly random pair we know that

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
regularly

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
consider low order bits by adding small

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
render error

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
and the ringer just discuss those pc

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,719
instead

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
ring algebra can be applied to many

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
interesting

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,880
crypto primitives such as pseudorandom

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
functions

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
compute computational reusable extractor

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
cluster of the function

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
over one less travel functions and thus

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,440
obtained the cc2 publicly encryption via

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,880
the framework of

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,199
high current waters in 2008

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
we also constructed very simple uh

154
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
deterministic

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,000
encryption by ring advance interestingly

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
there are two submissions the zipper in

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,840
one three and

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,359
round five in round two based on a ring

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
at the bar among lisa

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
who's quantum round two and round three

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,080
submissions

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
okay given many useful applications

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
above

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
it is important to determine the highest

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,400
of ring output

166
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,880
and it is also the focus of this world

167
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,799
i summarize prior harness results of

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
playing elder bear and the ring out of

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,919
there

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,719
by the following figures more precisely

171
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,198
we consider

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
the hardest of these problems problems

173
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
in two cases

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
with suprapoli modulus and with poly

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,039
modulus

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
for playing algebra the hardest results

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,960
are more complete

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
first of all we can show basic reduction

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,198
line of ldl

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,039
from a prior works and there are simple

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,440
reductions from 30 lb

182
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
to 30 other players and the decision

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
elderly

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
to decision entrepreneur we still

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,080
propose modules from the work of bpr2

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
the worker by violence lamppost then

187
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,400
elected in

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
stem field in 2015 ended the work by

189
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,520
bogdanov

190
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,560
nestle rituals and russia in 2016

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,440
separately show reductions from

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
30 lb to 30 other players with polling

193
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,680
models

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
and the work of bgmrr16 also shows the

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,919
reduction from

196
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,199
search to decision l element with poly

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
modulus

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,280
interestingly the work by owen grant

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
peter and wix in 2013 shows another

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,280
reduction

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
from uh decision adobe to decision

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,638
editors with

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
polymatters their reduction holds even

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,360
with leaky secret

205
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
however in the ring setting the results

206
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
are limited

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,599
besides the basic reduction of wing lw

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,159
from prior works

209
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,639
we can also show reductions of ring

210
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,039
other

211
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,960
ring adapter with super poly modules by

212
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,639
the symbol of the ppr2

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,359
the work of bgm rr16 also shows a

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,479
reduction

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,120
from a search ringer bring adobe

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
to a search ring out of there with poly

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
models

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
but there are two main open questions in

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,120
the ring setting compared with

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
playing out of there on the one hand we

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
don't know

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,319
the pseudo-randomness of bringing

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,520
outlier with poly modulus

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,279
on the other hand the harness of a ring

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,319
advert or mojo advanced with

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,799
leaky secret is to be determined

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
finally it needs to point out a super

228
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,718
suprapoli modulus suffered worse

229
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,079
efficiency and the weaker security

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
compared with

231
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,240
polymodulus so it is important to

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,959
determine the highest of

233
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,880
hardness results for ring other with

234
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,160
poly modules

235
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,680
with this open questions log i

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,319
turn to the second part of this talk

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
uh this result also answers one of two

238
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,839
main

239
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,800
uh two uh main open questions in prior

240
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,839
works

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,599
as of preparation of our reduction

242
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,959
i ever introduced a new lw

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,040
r framework which captures a more

244
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,680
flexible

245
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,719
running procedure under encompassing

246
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,760
more outbreak

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
structures okay so the wrongdoing in

248
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
prior works

249
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,079
implicit is implicitly defined according

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
to

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,160
the coefficient value but this procedure

252
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,040
does law suit for

253
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,399
uh the rings of with risk with long

254
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,519
integral coefficients

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,640
such as the dual of green of a

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,959
ring of integers so here

257
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,600
we propose a new wrong d running

258
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,920
procedure running according to basis

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,959
we know that any ring of integers are

260
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
has at least

261
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,719
one z business b then an element x

262
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,800
in r can be interpreted as the integral

263
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,079
compilation of the basis b

264
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,279
and the longing of it is with respect to

265
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,719
the coefficients

266
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,240
for corresponding to b well

267
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,240
let's uh go a further step to define

268
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,279
a new framework which is called

269
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,440
legendary

270
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,120
this framework is inspired by the work

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,720
of piper in the paper in

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,000
2019 and it encompasses all

273
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
art regularly structured lwr such as

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,079
bringing electron

275
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,319
holy order module adobe player and more

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,279
and the show that the highlights of a

277
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
ringer

278
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
implies harness of other poly middle

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
products out of that

280
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
so from this we can focus on the

281
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,519
hardness of ring out of there

282
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,959
okay let me show the pseudo randomness

283
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,000
of ring adapter

284
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,239
the target is to show the reduction from

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
search ring output to decision ring at

286
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,000
the ground

287
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,440
let me give me ring and of the samples

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,920
and the decision ring at

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,160
the oracle d uh we wish to organize

290
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,360
the oracle d is defined to open one if

291
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
the input pair

292
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
is ringing at the right sample and the

293
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,680
output zero if

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,760
the pair is rendered at high level

295
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
fighting s is equivalent to finding

296
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,640
coefficients of s

297
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,519
under pieces b and our

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,319
technicals are similar to zero lpr pen

299
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,079
which use

300
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,880
pseudo-randomness of ring at the knee

301
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,000
our reduction path is as follows step

302
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
one issues

303
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if search ring admirer is hard then the

304
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
intermediate

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,560
search a problem pi a ring at the right

306
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
also hard

307
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,160
step two shoots a reduction from pi

308
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,880
ringer

309
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
to an immediate worst case decision

310
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
problem

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,439
a d ring other ruling out of the supply

312
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
and the step three issues the reduction

313
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
from d

314
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,920
bring out ring out of the sub i uh to

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,959
the energy

316
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,519
case problem decision ring algorithm

317
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
we remarked that step three com contains

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,079
two sub steps

319
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,240
which will be explained next let me

320
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,199
elaborate the reduction chain

321
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,120
as we mentioned before step three has

322
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,839
two sub steps

323
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
the first one is a hybrid argument which

324
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,839
shows that

325
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,279
if there exists an algorithm d can

326
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,560
distinguish the pair a

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,240
b from random pair then there must exist

328
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,839
a distinguisher d t i theta can

329
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,040
distinguish the pair a b

330
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,639
mod p i from the pair a random u

331
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,160
api here we use the

332
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,040
properties that are sub q by rp

333
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
it can be factorized into the tensor of

334
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,719
sub rings

335
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,360
under isomorphism the second step is

336
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,680
worst case to average kiss reduction

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,959
which means that we can solve problem

338
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
for uniform s

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,638
then we can solve problems for os this

340
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,120
step

341
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,839
involves a dirty randomization technique

342
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,880
similar to

343
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,079
pgmrr16 in detail we transform the pair

344
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,519
a b

345
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,959
into the pair a rb where r is a random

346
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,440
invertible element

347
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,479
then the new element a prime is also

348
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
uniform

349
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,279
and s prime equal into r inverse times s

350
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,319
is also uniform over the invert

351
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,120
over the inward domain thus this step

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,480
requires s

353
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,120
important for step two

354
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
we use the standard uh standard guess

355
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
and check the trick

356
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
which means that using a di to find a

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
smart pi where

358
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,560
di distinguish the pair a b multiplier

359
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,240
and

360
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,119
a u mod pi as before given the pair ap

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,320
mod pi

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,360
we transform either into a plus uh q

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,560
over p times s and the p plus

364
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,240
h plus v times g where v

365
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,319
and h are defined appropriately and g is

366
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,639
the guess of smart pi more precisely

367
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
v is defined as the element of 10 is

368
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,160
uniformly random mod pi

369
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,839
and zero otherwise h is defined as the

370
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,319
uniformly random over pg j is less than

371
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
i

372
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
and zero otherwise so you see the

373
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,399
existence of

374
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
v and h comes from chinese remaining

375
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,360
theorem

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,639
we can say if g equals to s mod pi

377
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,560
the plug of h plus v times g minus s

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:40,639
in p i plus zero otherwise

379
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,920
it is uniformly random the formal case

380
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,360
b prime plus h plus v times g minus s

381
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,719
marked yeah equals to

382
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,000
b prime mark i and the later case

383
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,199
is uniformly random as h plus v

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,959
times g minus small p i acts as a one

385
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,359
term pair law

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
therefore we can use the oracle di to

387
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,880
test two cases

388
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,079
and try all possible values to find the

389
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,160
smart pi

390
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,199
because we need to try all possible

391
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
values

392
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,479
the size of smart pi should be poly

393
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,040
which

394
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,440
requires idrp are highly speed

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,199
furthermore step one shoot them finding

396
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
a smart pi for some pi

397
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:26,240
implies finding a smart pr here we use

398
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,360
the properties of automotive or galway

399
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
group

400
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
the pair aap mod pg can be transformed

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,079
into

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,040
the pair sigma iga sigma igb molecule

403
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,399
because for any idea of pipg there you

404
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,319
can see the sigma ig

405
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,880
such that sigma energy fpga equals 2pi

406
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
we which tell us the pair of sigma iga

407
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
sigma igb

408
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
is a valid symbol for the search oracle

409
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,079
xi

410
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,959
such that a sigma igb equals to the

411
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,079
rounding of

412
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,518
a sigma iga times sigma igs and

413
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,839
si can output uh the sigma

414
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
ig smaller pi then we can use the

415
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,120
inverse of the

416
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
other of this on or system to find it as

417
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,279
mod pg

418
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,759
and finally output small pr by trying to

419
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,040
remind zero

420
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,680
so what has we need it is a rounding

421
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
it is sigma wrongly equals to a range of

422
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,439
sigma

423
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
which means that the automobile terms

424
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,800
somehow

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
committed with the uh running operation

426
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
corresponding

427
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,399
to certain bases how to achieve this

428
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:37,279
we find that running with respect to uh

429
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,920
the non-meaningful basis is what we need

430
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,639
simply speaking a lot more inequality is

431
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,560
a bit z

432
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,279
basis of our strategy any

433
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
automorphism a sigma x as permutation

434
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,240
over b

435
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,639
which means that sigma ip equals to b up

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,519
to our permutation

437
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,480
equivalent with this basis now we can

438
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,519
compute the

439
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,759
sigma of a running es in this way here a

440
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,199
times s can be interpreted by the

441
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,400
integral compilation

442
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,319
of basis b the first equation is the

443
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,760
definition of rounding with respect to

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,480
the basis b

445
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
and the case level in a red frame uses

446
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,679
the

447
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,720
property of normal integral basis

448
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
because sigma b

449
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
and b are the same basis

450
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,079
from the argument about we know that

451
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
the nominal basis is the key of the

452
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,720
region in our reduction

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
so we wish to determine the existence of

454
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
normal inhibitor basis

455
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,280
here bird and the spicer shows that a

456
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,679
lot more integral bases are widespread

457
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
if the underlying number field is

458
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,480
extremely ramified over q

459
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,520
this is a this is the little involved

460
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
specifically

461
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,918
the power phrase a psychothermic means

462
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,039
satisfy this this problem for better

463
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,320
understanding

464
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,440
i give some simple examples here k

465
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,320
equals to um q zeta p zero for sum prime

466
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
p0

467
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,439
and the r is its ring of integers then

468
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,480
and they have a long mean parenthesis

469
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,600
and then the p zeros power from one to p

470
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,200
zero minus one and when m equals to

471
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,399
uh the product of primes pi

472
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,600
then k and i have a longer equal thesis

473
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,160
of the tensor of vi where pi is uh the

474
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,678
long mean

475
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,600
the longer integral basis of qpm

476
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,720
now we finished the reduction of

477
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,039
pseudo-randomness of

478
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,919
ring element and now go a further step

479
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,640
to the final part

480
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,440
this result also answers the other open

481
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,200
questions

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,160
in prior works before presenting our

483
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,160
confusion

484
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,720
i'd like to introduce an interesting

485
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,320
reduction for playing at the lwr

486
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
proposed by the worker of

487
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
all in korean pizzagate and weeks in

488
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,280
2013.

489
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,760
their ideas is used uh lw to show the

490
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,918
pair

491
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,320
a and the running of a times s is

492
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
computationally indistinguishable from

493
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,879
the pair a

494
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,919
and is around the operand element

495
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,559
uh and the k2 of their reduction is an

496
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,240
efficient

497
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,879
lossy simpler with the following two

498
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,280
properties the first one in general

499
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,720
the matrix atl output by the losses

500
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,280
simpler

501
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
then elderly implies that each other is

502
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
computational

503
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
only in distinct which both from random

504
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,320
matrix

505
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
the second one is the pair each other

506
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,399
and boundary of atl times

507
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,440
preserve much of the entropy of s

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,799
their reduction path is as follows

509
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,840
step 1 switch a to atf

510
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,879
or reverse by elderly assumption step

511
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,678
two is

512
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
proved in the information theoretically

513
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,840
which relies

514
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,919
on the left or left over his lemma over

515
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,000
dq they can even show

516
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
the reduction for the case of leaky

517
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,320
secret

518
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,520
however akbw's approach cannot be

519
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,280
applied to ring and

520
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,520
ring out of the plant this is because

521
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
a one-ring element a is usually

522
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,879
invertible

523
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,559
and it is impossible to define the loss

524
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,480
is simpler in this case

525
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,360
first of all even if a is locking

526
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,080
variable and the lossy symbol is defined

527
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,639
as a running atl times this year does

528
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,918
not

529
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,960
preserve enough entropy for extraction

530
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,159
in fact bringing up under certain leaky

531
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,120
scenario is insecure

532
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,760
we breathe the attacks as follows we

533
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,760
should just

534
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,799
search a ring out the ring out of that

535
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,158
can be solved

536
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:44,480
if uh the secret has completely falls

537
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:48,240
into some idea factor j of qr

538
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,520
actually s is with no information on

539
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,600
g's complement g bar or complete the

540
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:59,280
leak on g bar so high level in general

541
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,158
j r is a sub lattice of r and the

542
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
g r is more sparse than r so large

543
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,280
perturbation

544
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,158
over r is relatively small to gr

545
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,960
and then we can apply bob x algorithm uh

546
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,840
to decode the perturbation

547
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,480
okay from this part we introduce our new

548
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
hardest

549
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,280
result of mojo and there and then the

550
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,799
module ever is defined as

551
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,039
follows we want to show a reduction from

552
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,679
decision ringer atp

553
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,320
to decision module lwr even with leakage

554
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,440
here let's record akp direct approach

555
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
again

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,880
we can generalize either to the ring

557
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,600
setting as follows

558
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
similar to akpw we can define the loss

559
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,918
simpler over

560
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,120
rings and the computational

561
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,440
indistinguishability of step one relies

562
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,719
on

563
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,720
ring letter b and the running of atm

564
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
attempts as preserve we love entropy of

565
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,799
s

566
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
if k is large but the main barrier is

567
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,918
that

568
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
there is no uh ring level left over hash

569
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,919
lemma

570
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,639
we finally get rid of this theory by

571
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,760
showing a ring level range lemma

572
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,120
the high level is our inner product over

573
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,520
ring is a good extractor in order to

574
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,080
interpret this lemma more precisely

575
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
we first introduce the hash function

576
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,639
family indexed by vector a

577
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,039
in r sub due to the key the computation

578
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,320
of

579
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,840
input x is the inner product of a n x

580
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,760
molecular

581
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,879
we can also define the function and of

582
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,480
the distribution

583
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,360
d h r cubed as the distribution of the

584
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
pair

585
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,280
f a and b we have the sample from

586
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
the function family edge and a b equals

587
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,080
to f x for some x

588
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,719
sample from the input domain so the

589
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,760
target

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,640
to show the distribution d h r cubed

591
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,158
is statistically indistinguishable from

592
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,039
uniformly random distribution

593
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,559
our main result is that we found the

594
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,520
statistical distance

595
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,440
of the two distributions by this way

596
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,440
this one is determined by the sum

597
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,440
of the loans of ideal factor q of qr and

598
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
the collision probability of input

599
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,640
domain molecule

600
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,000
we sketch our ideas the ideas of our

601
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
proof as follows

602
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
we first use the one known two known

603
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,919
inequality

604
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,559
to bound the statistical distance by

605
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
christian

606
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,520
collision probability of e and the

607
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
partition the remaining probability

608
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,480
by ideas we need to point out that

609
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,520
uh miss yongshan moore's approach

610
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
of partition by gcd is not applicable to

611
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,240
our case

612
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,919
because we cannot define gcd for long

613
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,640
unique factorization domain we also rely

614
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,919
on uh the chinese dramatic theorem

615
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,640
and the fact that uh the idea of p

616
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,880
the prime idea pi is isomorphic to the

617
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,080
idea generated by two elements

618
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,120
q and fi are for some monica irreducible

619
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,360
fi

620
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,360
for more detail please refer our papers

621
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
the statement of our leftover dilemma is

622
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,919
a little involved

623
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
here we can apply the two concrete cases

624
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,520
from our lemma we know that

625
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,639
for general ring we just statistical

626
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,879
distance between the pair of uh

627
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,480
of ring vector a the inner product

628
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,840
of a s molecule r and the random pair is

629
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,120
bounded by a website

630
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,480
when s mod any ideal vector q has

631
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,959
enough entropy for second atomic ring

632
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
the entropy requirement of s can be

633
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,799
weakened

634
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,760
and if we consider the ideal qr

635
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,000
with large ideal factor the entropy of s

636
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,480
molecule can be smaller

637
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
at least you might remark that when qr

638
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,840
has lost bleeding

639
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,559
property then the number of idea factor

640
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,360
factors are large which means that as

641
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
with small

642
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,799
dimensions sufficiently preserve relapse

643
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,678
entropy

644
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,879
and from the results about smaller

645
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
entropy of s

646
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,720
molecule is needed so this case leads to

647
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,039
small

648
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,279
parameter size when applying our green

649
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,600
level has lemma

650
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,720
on the other hand high splitting of qr

651
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,158
corresponds to

652
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,159
large parameters size yes it may be able

653
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,279
to accelerate a computation

654
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
for example when q equals to one mod to

655
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,400
one

656
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,360
we can apply the ngt library to

657
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
accelerate

658
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,000
the computation so there is the

659
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,320
trade-off between the efficiency

660
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,320
of space and the computation when

661
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,678
applying our level

662
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,799
finally let me let me conclude this talk

663
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,360
uh from this talk we know that in any

664
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
segment array a ring at the right is to

665
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,799
the random if

666
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,960
being out of there is one way and the qr

667
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,559
are completely displeased

668
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,000
why does this uh hold in more general

669
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,720
ring settings

670
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,520
and mojo ever issued random even with

671
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
leakage

672
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,879
if ring at least so the random and the

673
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
circular

674
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,720
uh s contains enough entropy not any

675
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,080
idea factors

676
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,600
of qr uh but we don't know if this

677
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,039
holder for

678
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:36,399
if this holds for ringer

679
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:36,400
okay thank you
