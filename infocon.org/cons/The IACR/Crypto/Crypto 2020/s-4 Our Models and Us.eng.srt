1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,319
it's the image of a one-way function

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,359
[Laughter]

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,359
i love this

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,320
i didn't know that it was smoked cigars

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,720
that's that's a

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,359
new tidbit i was a very short interlude

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
fortunately for me and my lungs i

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
couldn't take it right away rather than

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,320
telling me

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
20 or 30 or 40 years later they told me

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,559
so with uh was lucky

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,519
we are recording and live on youtube so

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,519
enjoy your session

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
all right that is a great pleasure to be

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
here let's see if i can

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
manage to i want to say hello to

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,959
everybody

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
and uh and then uh just trust me to

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,879
be launching the slides give me wait

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
wait till you don't share yet michelle

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
has to introduce you

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
oh oh i him sorry sorry okay that's even

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,879
better

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,399
i think michelle's volume might be a bit

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,119
low

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
what sorry mitchell's volume i think is

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,760
a bit

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640
low i could hear him but very low in the

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,479
background

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,479
it's off oh it's off

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
just one second

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,079
okay i'm using the computer audio it's

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,600
easier

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,079
so before i start the session uh if you

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,158
would like to ask questions uh please

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,000
use the zulip chat

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,079
which is or if you have a hard time

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,600
accessing it you can also

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,360
type a question on the zoom chat

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,479
and uh leo who is the general chair we

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,680
also be helped me

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,600
monitor the questions so that we

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
silvia would not have to worry about it

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,440
so hi everybody uh so

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,879
crypto

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,920
cryptologic research and this choice is

55
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,079
made by the board of directors

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,559
this year is a great honor for me to

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,800
introduce silva mikali who

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,560
is the 2020 aci distinguished lecturer

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
and uh as you know silva michael has

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,040
been a faculty of

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,239
mit in the electrical engineering and

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,760
computer science department

63
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,519
since 1983 he

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,280
in his careers includes

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
cryptography zero knowledge

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
pseudo-random generation

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,720
secure protocols mechanisms

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,480
mechanism design and block chains

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
and in particular silva is the

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,159
co-inventor of

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
probabilistic encryption zero knowledge

72
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,679
proofs

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
verifiable random functions and

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
essentially many of the protocols

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,920
there are the foundation of modern

76
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,839
cryptography

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
during his career silva has been

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,238
companies

80
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,280
more recently silva found that

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,080
algorand a fully decentralized secure

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,319
and scalable blockchain which provides a

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
common platform for building products

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,119
and services

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,119
for a boardless economy

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
cbs research has also resulted in

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,599
numerous awards

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519

silvio has trained 20 phd students

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,440
who themselves have trained many more

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,199
in particular many of silvio's academic

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,320
descendants are responsible for

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,600
the organization of this conference

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,040
as leo mentioned to me

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,000
this includes myself the acr president

for this kind invitation and more so for

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
having worked doubly hard to organize

141
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,159
this historic conference

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,960
in the middle of a pandemic it is

143
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,600
inspiring to see the determination

144
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,758
of our community to overcome all

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
obstacles

40 times to our splendid community

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,799
congratulations indeed for these 40

150
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,599
years that have been

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,479
dramatically changed for the better our

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
field

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,758
science and the world at large

154
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,359
rarely as a scientific community

155
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,400
contributed so much

156
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,440
in so few years

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,560
our agenda today is very simple indeed

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,160
a two-point agenda one discussing

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,759
a specific model and two discussing

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,800
models at large both discussions

161
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,639
rest assured will be blissfully simple

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,800
let us start with a specific model

163
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
the specific model i wish to briefly

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,240
discuss with you is algorand's

165
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,599
communication model let me start

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,800
by recalling an old geography question

167
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,840
with whom does the soviet union borders

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,560
and the answer was with

169
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,719
whatever he wants same for cryptography

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
what does cryptography investigate

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
whatever he wants

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
the subject under the purview of

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,240
cryptography

174
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
is immense

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
demand is growing originally dealing

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
with secret writing the very etymology

177
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
of the world cryptography

178
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
cryptography has evolved to become a

179
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,639
general theory of interaction

180
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,359
in the presence of powerful adversaries

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
demand as i was saying is not only

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,800
enormous and growing

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,280
why why because adversaries are

184
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
everywhere not just because i'm a

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,919
cryptographer

186
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,039
but because any sufficient complex

187
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,599
system will soon become adversarial

188
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,878
give it enough time and adversary

189
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,400
indulgently emerge from complexity

190
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,360
thus let me make some simple directions

191
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,719
the world is becoming more and more

192
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
complex

193
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,280
our survival as a species will depend

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,080
on ever more complexity technologies

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,120
over time adversary will naturally

196
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
emerge

197
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
from this complexity and only the

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,800
adversarial robustness

199
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,000
indeed the cryptographic robustness of

200
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,240
our technology

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,440
will keep us alive thus

202
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
the time has come it is time that we

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
cryptography

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
fully accept our responsibilities and

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
carry the world

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
on our broad shoulders

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,160
speaking of adversaries what can

208
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,640
our cryptographic adversaries do

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,279
currently the adversary attack the

210
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
protocol

211
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,720
in any conceivable way but essentially

212
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,319
leaves

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,440
the underlying communication model alone

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
wait wait i can mention one exception i

215
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
can mention another

216
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,319
sure but an exception does not make the

217
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,360
rule

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,640
and as we say in italy one swallow

219
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
doesn't make it spring the overwhelming

220
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,000
portion

221
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
of cryptographic analysis and design

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,279
confines adversarial attacks

223
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
to the protocols alone this is a major

224
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
gap

225
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,800
because protocols run on communication

226
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
network

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,719
and attacking the network can be

228
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,680
substantially more beneficial to the

229
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
adversary

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,079
than attacking the protocol we must

231
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,079
remedy this

232
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
there are two main communication models

233
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,959
in which most of our

234
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,279
protocols are written both with a common

235
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
clock

236
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,640
the first model is the point-to-point

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
model which envisages a dedicated and

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,519
secure channel

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,480
for each pair of players involved

240
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,079
here i'm i got lazy and only partially

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
draw it because i didn't have the time

242
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
to draw a 100 lines

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
if the diversity wants to invest model

244
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
to hear the conversation over one

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
channel

246
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
you would have to corrupt one of the two

247
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,319
player

248
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,680
at his ends even this

249
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,880
or this or both

250
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,439
in sum to corrupt honest communication

251
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,439
the adversary must corrupt players

252
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,800
the second model is the synchronous

253
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
authenticated broadcast model

254
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,519
if some player i sends a message

255
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,120
m at time t then

256
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,279
all other players receive m at time t

257
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
simultaneously or t plus one doesn't

258
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,320
matter and know that his sender is

259
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
indeed i

260
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,720
again to correct honest communication

261
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,720
the adversary must corrupt players

262
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,199
in sum we have two main communication

263
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
models

264
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,120
neither of which quite exist

265
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
not the point to point network because a

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
billion square

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
if you have a billion players is 10 to

268
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,279
18 it would be hard to find enough cover

269
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
to cut to cover the earth with so many

270
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
wires

271
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,319
i couldn't find a ball of an f

272
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,800
like copper but here is a wool but you

273
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,120
see the point

274
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
nor is the authenticated broadcast model

275
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
easily found

276
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
indeed a megaphone has very local reach

277
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
digitally signed radio does not

278
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,959
guarantee what i hear

279
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,000
is also heard by everybody and so on so

280
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,239
forth

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,880
but these super abstract models

282
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
enable us to focus on a very hard

283
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
problem

284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,399
namely reconciling privacy and

285
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,800
correctness

286
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,839
and they adequately captured two-party

287
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
portals

288
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
which admittedly are a very important

289
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
case

290
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,959
the challenge is to develop new and

291
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,440
realistic model that enable us to

292
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,880
analyze a build system that are secure

293
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,320
against both protocol and network

294
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,360
attacks

295
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,240
and involve billions of players

296
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,839
that is we need to guarantee protocol

297
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
and network security

298
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,839
for the web for blockchain and similarly

299
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,279
massive

300
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,639
applications scalability is the new

301
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
challenge

302
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,720
we have to guarantee secure interaction

303
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,719
at a global scale

304
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,439
this is the context of the algorand

305
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,639
communication model

306
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,760
if you want to talk about this model

307
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
as for any other model we must talk lots

308
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
about

309
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,920
knobs that is tunable parameters

310
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,279
and lots and lots of tedious details

311
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,479
blood sweat and tears of cryptographic

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
analysis and design but we have neither

313
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
the time

314
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,519
nor the patience for this today

315
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,839
thus let me focus on just the zest

316
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
of this morrow

317
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,719
in the argonne models there are clocks

318
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
and clocks are totally

319
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,279
local your clock and mine may show

320
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
different times

321
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,320
according to your clock it may be 115

322
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,439
according to mine 2 30.

323
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,480
but the duration of say a minute

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
is the same in other words a minute is a

325
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,680
minute

326
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,839
for me for you and everybody else

327
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
in the algorithm model there is a

328
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,240
sequence of alternating

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,320
good and bad bad periods

330
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,320
a bad period is arbitrarily long

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
during such a period of adversary has

332
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
total control

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
of the communication network for each

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
message sent

335
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,760
the adversary decides the precise time

336
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,239
at which will be received

337
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
or whatever is going to be received at

338
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
all

339
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,720
in particular the adversary can put each

340
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,680
one of us in a separate faraday cage

341
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
and prevent the exchange of any messages

342
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
and therefore block

343
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,439
the cortical progress however

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,760
this is a temporary ability but periods

345
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
are

346
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,720
arbitrarily long but finite

347
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,320
and when they end there follows a

348
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,639
good period or better said a reasonable

349
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,639
period

350
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,240
each good period is minimally long

351
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
meaning last a minimum length of time

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
else

353
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,959
we can consider it part of the previous

354
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,680
bad period

355
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,319
indeed it should last nothing long

356
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,800
enough

357
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,560
for the portable to make a modicum more

358
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,359
progress

359
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,839
such a minimal length is a parameter a

360
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,839
knob that you can set locally

361
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,120
of course a good period offers only

362
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
modality guarantees

363
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
or timely delivery not only is delivered

364
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,519
not 100

365
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,959
guaranteed but even but very much

366
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,160
depends on message length

367
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,279
such guarantees are themselves again

368
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,279
tunable norms for instance

369
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,360
100 byte messages broadcast by honest

370
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,000
players are guaranteed to reach

371
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
only 90 percent of the of the honest

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,079
player

373
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,959
in a tenth of a second and say a mega

374
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
byte a message broadcast by honest

375
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,920
player

376
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
reaches only 90 percent of the honest

377
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,439
player

378
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,439
within a second

379
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,959
should we go backstage that is should we

380
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,680
open the hood and specify

381
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,638
exactly how the algorithm communication

382
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,160
model is implemented

383
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,920
not really indeed the main point of

384
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,040
any model is to abstract away details

385
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,199
provided we convince ourselves

386
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
that the realistic path of victory

387
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
exists

388
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,720
morals must be validated

389
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
at least in cartography you cannot just

390
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
say

391
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,560
i have a good moral else

392
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
you have a good moral i have a better

393
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,719
motto etc etc etc

394
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,399
in our field this is a meaningful

395
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,440
meaning meaningless race in our field

396
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,720
we must show the power of our morals

397
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,120
morals are cheap the proof is in the

398
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,120
pudding

399
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,879
let me proceed axiomatically the right

400
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,760
model

401
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
is the one that lets you prove the right

402
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,000
theorem

403
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,000
period who says this

404
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,720
i do

405
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
so

406
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,520
so let's say what is going to be very

407
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,640
for

408
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,639
the validating theorem for the algorithm

409
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,280
algorithm communication model

410
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,120
it is the existence of a super fast

411
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
byzantine agreement

412
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,719
according to the original definition on

413
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,200
a massive scale

414
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,640
of course such a protocol exists in the

415
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,880
algonquin

416
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
so let us recall peace shostak and

417
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,000
lampert

418
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
original byzantine agreement what is a

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,919
business agreement

420
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,840
is a communication protocol vet with an

421
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
honest majority guarantees

422
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,678
two main properties consistency

423
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
meaning if everybody starts with the

424
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,400
same value v

425
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,080
then at the end of the conversation all

426
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,000
the

427
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,360
good players output v

428
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,440
and second no matter which values

429
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,199
players may start at the end of a

430
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,320
conversation

431
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,640
everybody agrees on a common value

432
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,240
okay they must always agree on a common

433
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
value of a good player

434
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,559
but if everybody starts with a specific

435
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,600
value then not only they must agree

436
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,760
on a common value but on that

437
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,959
very value the challenges of a

438
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,240
byzantine agreement is that

439
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,960
that has been very slow defined

440
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,640
slow the maximum number of players in

441
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,400
any real application was 12.

442
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,120
so in algorand we can achieve

443
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
byzantine agreement on a planetary scale

444
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,840
and

445
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
with unparalleled efficiency

446
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,039
so here is the battle plan it is

447
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,080
i'll break it down for you in two magic

448
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,080
phases

449
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,600
alerting you that the magic will be

450
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,879
replaced by mathematics

451
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,399
phase one afar some players are publicly

452
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
and randomly selected

453
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,320
among all players which is it to do by

454
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,840
magic

455
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
and these players run byzantine

456
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,000
agreement

457
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
and once they agree on something they

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
digitally sign the result

459
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,960
and broadcast

460
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,159
okay let me start with sanity check

461
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:58,559
one does this battle plan has a chance

462
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,320
consider the the consistency property

463
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,639
and let's assume we have a billion

464
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,120
players out there

465
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,799
so let's assume for cons for the

466
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,320
consistency property that all these

467
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,760
billion players start with the same

468
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,158
value

469
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,559
then after a random restriction of a

470
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,120
player to just a thousand

471
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,879
if everybody started with the same value

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
then the restricted players

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
better have the same value and because

474
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,039
they have the same value

475
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,959
and the protocol is abundant in

476
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,520
agreement they will end up

477
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
all these the honest people among this

478
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,158
thousand to agree

479
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,720
on that value and therefore the majority

480
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,159
of these people will sign and propagate

481
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,120
the value v

482
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:47,919
to inform everybody else you know what

483
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,280
so far so good check one is passed

484
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,120
sanity check two

485
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,879
let's consider now the agreement poverty

486
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,120
we have a billion of players each one

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,640
has their own values

488
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,639
once you start having a random

489
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,200
restriction to a fastened player

490
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,039
g if everybody at the wrong value we

491
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,320
still have their own value now

492
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
and what is the property of our

493
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
byzantine agreement but we will agree on

494
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
a common value no matter what they

495
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,520
started with

496
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,520
you know so far so good

497
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,720
third and last sanity check

498
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,440
our byzantine agreement requires

499
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,039
two-thirds majority

500
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,280
naturally to probabilistic guarantee

501
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,799
a proper majority after a random

502
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
restriction of a player

503
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,639
we must have a greater majority before

504
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,440
the restriction

505
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
for instance

506
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
if we want two-thirds majority to reach

507
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,159
a budget agreement

508
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,320
we need something like three quarters

509
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,280
majority

510
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,600
strictly speaking you need two thirds

511
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
plus

512
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,439
epsilon but then you need the much big

513
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
more than a fusion player to make sure

514
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
that

515
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,439
under a random restriction you have two

516
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,480
first honesty

517
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,840
okay so then you know what if we

518
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,880
we do this i'm i'm convinced that

519
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,199
we have passed the third sanity check

520
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,039
so okay okay i get now the eye level

521
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
logic

522
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,799
but now because i get very level logic

523
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,640
if you don't mind i have a few questions

524
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,280
a few questions you should have

525
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,159
thousands of questions at this level

526
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,879
but we have only time for free the ones

527
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,559
that i forget asked the most

528
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,559
and the first question is who chooses

529
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,360
this random restriction who chooses a

530
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,639
1000 people committee members who run

531
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,158
byzantine agreement

532
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,120
and the answer is we use cryptographic

533
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,600
sortation

534
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,559
which means that the committee members

535
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
choose themselves

536
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,280
choose themselves sounds a terrible idea

537
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,158
but not so fast because what does this

538
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,200
mean to choose

539
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,559
myself means that each one of us

540
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,159
must run around lottery a lottery that

541
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,080
is cryptographically fair

542
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,320
and therefore no one of us can cheat

543
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
to improve the odds of being part of

544
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,000
this committee

545
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
but you can prove that you are a part of

546
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
the committee

547
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,200
if you want in other words you pull down

548
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,039
once a kind of a slotted machine only

549
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,159
once you can pull the lever

550
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,760
case one you get a winning ticket a

551
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,559
mathematical proof that you're part of a

552
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,240
committee

553
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,320
and you can propagate the winning ticket

554
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
and say your opinion about the blog

555
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,080
about the block up or down

556
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
if you don't win you can say anything

557
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,000
well nobody pays attention to what you

558
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
say

559
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,520
okay let me actually show that this

560
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,840
is super decentralized way of proceeding

561
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,840
how long does a cryptographic

562
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,919
um lottery takes a microsecond

563
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:06,240
gee that is pretty fast

564
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:09,360
and if you not let me tell you that

565
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,480
everybody participates to the lottery

566
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,158
the lorry takes a micro second and

567
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
is super scalable because if you win

568
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,919
velour you just have to propagate a

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,559
winning ticket and a message that is

570
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,640
easy

571
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,399
now let me ask you that is super secure

572
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
by protocol

573
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
why is it super secure because i'm

574
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,440
assuming that i have a

575
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,320
very scary and powerful adversary who

576
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
can corrupt

577
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
afar some players at the snapping of my

578
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,039
fingers

579
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,199
i can corrupt anyone i want

580
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,080
instantaneously

581
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
whom should i corrupt well the people

582
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,879
who

583
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
the 1000 people who run byzantine

584
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,039
agreement but i have a problem

585
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,960
i don't know who are the winners of

586
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,480
these internal lotteries because these

587
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,600
are the members of the committee so

588
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
beforehand i was tremendous power but i

589
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,439
don't know

590
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,960
whom i should corrupt however once the

591
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,760
player

592
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
somehow propagate their winning ticket

593
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,600
and their

594
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,799
opinion about the block now i know

595
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,439
who the players are

596
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,000
and i can corrupt all of them but at

597
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
this point

598
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
in some sense is a bit too late because

599
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,760
of whatever the people have to say

600
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
they've already said it and their

601
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,000
messages are propagated

602
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
across the network so in other words

603
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
this way of proceeding

604
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,600
is secure because beforehand i don't

605
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,640
know whom i want to corrupt

606
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,639
and exposed is a bit too late to corrupt

607
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,158
okay so that's where so the second

608
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,240
question

609
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,720
is but aren't byzantine agreement too

610
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,520
slow for a fuss on player you said 12

611
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,640
yes i know but not from this protocol

612
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
this protocol

613
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,919
only takes an end full of steps and in

614
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
each step

615
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
each player is required to send a single

616
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,799
short

617
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,799
and trivially computed message

618
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,360
but can't the adversary attack all

619
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,520
committee members

620
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,080
after the first step absolutely can

621
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,559
the adversary can attack otherwise

622
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
saying

623
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,440
the network and the protocol and in the

624
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,559
protocol the adversary is

625
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,120
dynamic not static

626
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,120
if the diversity is dynamic and we

627
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,399
envision a free quarters almost a

628
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
majority

629
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,440
then the adversary can corrupt

630
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,960
immediately 25 percent of the players

631
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,480
now 25 of say a billion

632
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,600
is 250 million

633
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,720
this is why more than

634
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,799
uh this is way more than just

635
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,279
the 1000 players in the committee if i

636
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,520
can corrupt 250 million people for sure

637
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,760
i can corrupt them

638
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,000
in the committee perhaps i cannot

639
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,360
corrupt them at the first step

640
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,400
but i can corrupt after i see where the

641
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,678
committee members are

642
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,440
at the second and successive step and

643
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,600
therefore i have enough to mess around

644
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:22,080
rest around completely the um

645
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,678
and the the security of the protocol

646
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,559
but this is not quite true because

647
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,600
the protocol byzantine protocol that is

648
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,158
also super fast

649
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,439
also satisfied a brand new property

650
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
which i'd like to call

651
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,240
player replaceability this means

652
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,520
that the protocol remains

653
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,360
secure even if its players are randomly

654
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
selected each step

655
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,360
and without their knowing who gets

656
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
chosen beforehand

657
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,279
and without to their communi any

658
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
communication between them before

659
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,480
beforehand and without any secret

660
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,158
channels

661
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,399
except or shared viable etc etc

662
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,480
in some totally different people

663
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,840
can talk for the first time without any

664
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
prior arrangement

665
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,918
and bring the ship to arbor and reach

666
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,840
byzantine agreement

667
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:19,200
the same way as if we're a single

668
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,199
this property it was so nuts that after

669
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,159
40 years in the field i never had

670
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,960
the idea of defining it i just stumbled

671
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,440
into it

672
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,159
and by the way once i stumble it i just

673
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,320
noticed that some protocol of the past

674
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,200
had this property which was so bizarre

675
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,960
when nobody

676
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,399
actually single it out isn't this

677
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,960
great so let's see

678
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,320
if we ever understood things properly

679
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
let's try to look at player

680
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,639
replaceability

681
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,199
up close assume the protocol takes four

682
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,480
steps

683
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,480
to reach agreement then there are four

684
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,640
separate randomly selected committees

685
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,159
the purple committee the red committee

686
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
the blue committee and the black

687
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,480
committee

688
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,240
let's see if we have the clear what is

689
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:13,120
the relationship between these players

690
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:17,440
none exactly they are random

691
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,439
independent different players

692
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,679
and by the way they also have different

693
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,880
numbers

694
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,679
because by self-selecting themselves

695
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,640
by a lottery sometimes we shoot for a

696
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,520
thousand winners

697
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,679
but sometimes there can be 1100 winners

698
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,080
another time

699
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,399
950 winners they are different players

700
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,879
they are different numbers and they have

701
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,120
no shared valuables

702
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,240
yet they can

703
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,439
somehow work as if they

704
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,039
are the same protocol the same committee

705
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,880
all along

706
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,080
executing every single step of the

707
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,360
protocol

708
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,480
this is being truly distributed

709
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,000
okay so there are several steps several

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,039
committees

711
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,720
the adversary can after he can only see

712
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,799
the committee member after they choose

713
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,520
themselves and can corrupt them all but

714
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,279
the ball is picked by another committee

715
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,240
without any prior arrangement

716
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,520
and progress can be made in this both

717
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,720
very distributed

718
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,720
and very secure fashion

719
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,158
now layer above replaceability

720
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,799
has been uh originated in a byzantine

721
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,200
agreement

722
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,480
but it's actually a wonderful tool for

723
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,760
blockchain

724
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,559
let me remind you what a blockchain is

725
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,158
is a decentralized database that is

726
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,120
readable by anyone

727
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,640
writeable by anyone and inalterable by

728
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,080
anyone

729
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,919
and you know the problem with the

730
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,799
problem is

731
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,799
it is not securing the chain because of

732
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,960
a

733
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,960
very early tool of

734
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,279
one-way hash is enough to secure the

735
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,640
chain

736
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,120
the only problem in a in a blockchain

737
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,880
is the choosing the next block who

738
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
should be allowed to choose

739
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,039
the next block on behalf of everybody

740
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,080
else

741
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,120
the prior approaches have

742
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,600
many many many um techniques

743
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,360
proof of work a delegated proof of stake

744
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,439
a bonded proof of stake

745
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,678
people invented all kinds of approaches

746
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,360
to approach me

747
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,000
reaching consensus on the next block

748
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,479
they envision all kinds of

749
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,880
characteristics

750
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,159
all kinds of cruel and unusual

751
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,039
punishment

752
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,679
people really went medio evil in order

753
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,320
to approximate consensus

754
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,880
they even accept forks that is they

755
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,399
accept

756
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,760
temporary split of the chain in some

757
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,959
people had been ready to pay any price

758
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,760
bear any burden to approximate consensus

759
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,039
on the next block

760
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:12,640
at algorand we took a different approach

761
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,640
we reach agreement on every single block

762
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,399
period

763
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,519
so at the highest level

764
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,518
it works like this

765
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,760
one user is randomly self-selected to

766
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,159
propose

767
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,480
an extra block making sure that there is

768
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,159
at least one such user

769
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,320
and then a committee of users are

770
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,919
randomly self-selected to run byzantine

771
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,399
agreement on the first user

772
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,399
the end

773
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,678
so in other words there are no forks the

774
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,799
protocol is fast and is easy

775
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,799
so the here is algorithm at work

776
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,279
here is the first block the genesis

777
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,720
block genesis block is the only block

778
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,880
which is unambiguous

779
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,039
in any blockchain because it's part of a

780
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,159
very description of a blockchain

781
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,480
and next to the block there is a favor a

782
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,679
universal symbol of lightness

783
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,720
and and uh effortlessness and as the

784
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,000
favor effortless falls to the ground one

785
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,480
block after the other

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,919
unfolds no forks

787
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,519
no need to go back no need to wait

788
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,440
for the block to be deep in the

789
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,840
inventory you can rely on a block

790
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,640
as soon as you relax why because we have

791
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,559
agreed

792
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
on every single block and there is no

793
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,480
need to go back

794
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,279
so if you look at the moral of the

795
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,760
stories that

796
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,279
player replaceability is less rare than

797
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,399
it seems

798
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,360
so what are its limits well

799
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,080
i want you to find out i want you to

800
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,840
discover

801
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,439
the powers of player replaceable

802
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,158
particles this concludes what i want to

803
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,519
say

804
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,080
about a specific model i wish now to

805
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,360
talk

806
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,360
about morals in general i'll be brief

807
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,519
discourse on them all

808
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,520
well actually i'm going to be a little

809
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,079
bit more simply

810
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,759
i want to share with you some brief and

811
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,040
personal considerations

812
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,720
on the role the models play

813
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,520
in our success 40 years into our joint

814
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,918
venture

815
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,040
a bit of introspection is perhaps due

816
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,359
let's discuss verify free

817
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,679
interpretations

818
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:36,560
for moral let's start with morals

819
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,560
as a prediction

820
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,359
to start with automatic controversy

821
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,839
it should be safe to define a model as a

822
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:50,480
simplification

823
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,480
that enables a rigorous analysis

824
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:00,480
here a model is both an act

825
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,480
simplifying and a goal enabling analysis

826
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,320
but is it really easy to deduce

827
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,960
f equal m a by just looking at the

828
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,040
elastic

829
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,240
reaction of a tree shaking under a

830
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,440
steady wind

831
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,560
that's the best i could do with

832
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,400
animation by the way guys

833
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,640
i don't think so you'd be much simpler

834
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
to come up with newtonian mechanics on

835
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,520
the billiard table

836
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,320
but even then friction heat dissipations

837
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,520
and other complexities risk to flow fear

838
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,040
uncertainty and doubt in our thinking

839
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:43,200
until we ultimately can actually

840
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,200
account for such complexities

841
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,680
in other words the theory

842
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,598
of moral as prediction essentially

843
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,598
presupposes the ability

844
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,320
to approximate an underlying reality

845
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,839
which by the way is assumed to be

846
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,359
approximable

847
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,359
else no border would work

848
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,598
that is the theory of moral as a

849
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,440
prediction requires a process of

850
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,400
continuous refinement

851
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,480
a constant and infiltrating infatigable

852
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,720
technical progress

853
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,680
the more complexity we can technically

854
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,480
handle

855
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,200
the more reality we can incorporate in

856
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,240
our model

857
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,279
in fact it'd be better to say that it is

858
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,759
the increasing precision of our model

859
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,200
that enables us to perceive what we are

860
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,440
still missing

861
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,879
generating a call to action to

862
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,320
conceptually tame

863
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,320
new pieces of reality

864
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,760
the theory of the model as approximation

865
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,119
of an underlying reality

866
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,400
is fascinating even possibly accurate

867
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:59,440
in the physical sciences but

868
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,760
is a bit hard sale in our field

869
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,480
can we really ascribe an underlying

870
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
reality

871
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,960
to cryptography what is

872
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,079
the underlying reality of say encryption

873
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,880
fortunately we can keep the zest

874
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,079
of this notion of a model with minimal

875
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
extra effort

876
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,040
indeed an imperceptible shift of our

877
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,960
point of view

878
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,680
and we have morals as elucidation

879
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,680
elucidation

880
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
simple let's not talk about an

881
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,160
underlying reality

882
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,680
but about an underlying idea an

883
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,000
archetypal idea a fundamental intuition

884
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,078
which is the duty of our modeling

885
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,640
efforts to liberate

886
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,000
the moral progressively frees the

887
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,920
underlying idea by

888
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,880
chipping away the surrounding cows

889
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,280
this theory was in renaissance florence

890
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,400
originally formulated for art by

891
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,839
philosophers such as

892
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,839
masilioficino here it is

893
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,720
philosophers have influence this is why

894
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,359
they can be so useful

895
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,560
and so dangerous they influence

896
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,480
scientists

897
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,560
artists and everywhere everyone else

898
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,560
invest examples artists

899
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,078
and when you see the so-called

900
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,440
unfinished work of michelangelo

901
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,400
you have to believe that the idea

902
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,280
was always there desperately trying to

903
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,440
free itself

904
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,480
from the stone which had been imprisoned

905
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,560
from time immemorial

906
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:48,079
but then wait can this underlying

907
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,759
idea theory be the case also for our

908
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,119
glorious models of our

909
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,720
community encryption digital signage

910

911

piece of saddle randomness

912
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,040
these are the morals of a change our

913
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,560
conceptual world

914
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,240
the morals that have enabled the

915
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,520
rigorous analysis of millionaire

916
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,799
equations such as

917
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,160
what is knowledge what is identity

918
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,839
is the world deterministic

919
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,799
but are our model really the progressive

920
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,119
elucidation

921
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
of an underlying archetypical idea

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,079
our secrecy randomness knowledge etc

923
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,240
ideas that precede us

924
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,119
that will survive us that are

925
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,000
independent

926
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,000
of us you know i'm not so sure

927
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,759
perhaps is uh

928
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,599
is is about time that we cast

929
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,200
a wider net morals as

930
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,520
creation so

931
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,279
if you consider the moral of a proof

932
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,759
right from ancient greece together and

933
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,520
tearing

934
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,000
classical proofs have been string

935
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,000
satisfying spatial syntactic properties

936
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,839
well we knew this all along we just said

937
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,560
it

938
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,839
more and more precisely as hundreds of

939
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,000
years passed

940
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,319
okay interactive proofs instead tell us

941
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,520
that proofs are special probabilistic

942
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,000
games

943
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,000
but it goes without saying this idea has

944
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,599
been lurking out there from the past to

945
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,359
millennia

946
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,119
but wait multiple interactive proofs

947
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,880
are instead the interrogation of

948
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,079
separate prisoners

949
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,359
but of course proofs are integration of

950
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,760
separately prisoners

951
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,560
perhaps implicitly but we always knew it

952
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,720
and cs both snarks starks are

953
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,200
cryptographic commitment intertwined

954
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,319
with refusing taxi strings

955
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,960
by all means why did we take us so long

956
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,720
to state the obvious

957
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,680
as for rational proofs they are the

958
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,279
arguments of a special function r

959
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,520
that is you and i execute a contra

960
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,599
you tell me whatever you want to tell me

961
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,720
about the actual value of f of x

962
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,640
and i will pay but i will pay you

963
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,720
according to the function r where

964
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,720
one i can choose r without knowing the

965
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,640
value of f of x myself

966
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,839
and yet r maximizes your reward

967
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,359
when you tell the truth about f of x

968
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,319
in other words in rational proofs truth

969
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,440
is the maximization of a polynomial time

970
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,000
function

971
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,680
absolutely this is exactly what we

972
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,560
really meant to say for the last

973
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,560
hundreds of years

974
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,960
elucidation of an archetypal idea are we

975
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,839
kidding to say so with a straight face

976
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,880
is as easy

977
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:51,200
as to climb glass walls

978
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:55,040
this is an impossible mission

979
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,680
so let's bite the bullet the simplest

980
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,560
explanation and most likely the best one

981
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,200
is that each model is an independent

982
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,200
creative

983
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,799
act an act that conjures up into

984
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,799
existence a new world

985
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,359
that beforehand was simply nowhere

986
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,400
interactive proofs are separate mental

987
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,279
constructs

988
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
so are probabilistic checkable proofs

989
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,119
computationally soundproof

990
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,119
rational proofs etc etc

991
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
model rhetorics morals are new but names

992
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,880
are classical

993
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,079
why why if new morals are autonomous

994
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,880
creative acts

995
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
do we continue to drag along all their

996
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,440
terminology

997
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:47,040
interactive proofs cs proves

998
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,400
rational proofs because we are

999
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,359
ambitious because we have a universal

1000
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,240
plans

1001
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,040
because we don't want to advance alone

1002
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,078
because we want to attract to our sides

1003
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,440
physics mathematics science at large

1004
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:07,040
and for becoming such a universal force

1005
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,800
we must signal continuity

1006
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,319
continuity is key if we want to become a

1007
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,560
universal force

1008
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,560
we must signal continuity

1009
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,560
reversing thomasi of alam pedusa saying

1010
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,640
if we want everything to change nothing

1011
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,839
must change actually thomas vellante

1012
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,160
said the reverse

1013
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,599
trying to tell about politicians if you

1014
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,160
want to

1015
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,160
to skip the status quo pretend you are a

1016
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,759
revolutionary

1017
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,799
so myth is the stronger glue and

1018
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,920
continuity

1019
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,920
is the stronger myth

1020
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
in other words we are not here to

1021
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,800
replace the classics

1022
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,920
we are here to tweak them if rhetorics

1023
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,720
can bring people to their willing death

1024
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,359
on the positive side it can certainly

1025
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,959
sustain

1026
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,000
change we need

1027
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,319
rhetorics for our model to be successful

1028
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,200
we must provide the illusion of

1029
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,640
continuity

1030
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,799
or we are not going to get many

1031
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,480
followers

1032
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,680
moral success if morals are autonomous

1033
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,920
creation

1034
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,960
then a successful model is one that

1035
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,040
brings

1036
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,200
more creative power that is

1037
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,000
self-referentially

1038
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,680
a successful model is one that inspires

1039
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,119
new models

1040
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,160
in terms of intergalactic exploration

1041
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,880
a moral is a world that

1042
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,879
has that is the base towards new world

1043
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,280
or more simply is a world

1044
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,520
which we enjoy living in at least for a

1045
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,520
while

1046
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,319
morals and notion morals and notion

1047
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,040
are inseparable at least so far take it

1048
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,119
from me

1049
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,400
there is no notion without morals and

1050
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,000
vice versa

1051
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,000
look at secure encryption

1052
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,480
to express the notion to express this

1053
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,520
notion you need a very precise model

1054
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,319
a moral specifies how

1055
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,520
exactly the public keys generated a

1056
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,920
model specify

1057
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,040
what that does the adversary see and

1058
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,640
what does not

1059
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,800
a model that precisely specify

1060
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,200
when the adversary sees what it is

1061
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,640
etcetera etcetera etcetera

1062
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,279
secrecy is a picky picky moral

1063
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,400
rather than a flash of intuition but

1064
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,960
rhetorically

1065
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,359
we must fake that is the latter

1066
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,800
thank you silvio but may i differ of

1067
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,640
course you can

1068
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,720
but only if you all the different

1069
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,040
intuitions about

1070
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,160
morals and notion and if this isn't the

1071
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,200
case

1072
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,240
then you don't just voice vague

1073
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,839
intuition

1074
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,640
do create a new world that

1075
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,920
differentiates moral and notion

1076
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,279
do create a new beautiful world in which

1077
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,280
all we want to live in

1078
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,359
but until you do let notion and moral

1079
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,079
be one and the same you needed the

1080
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,759
advent

1081
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,760
of zero knowledge to meaningfully

1082
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,800
differentiate verification from

1083
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,480
knowledge

1084
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,160
you needed that development or

1085
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,960
complexity theory to me

1086
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,440
meaningfully differentiating deciding

1087
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,920
the process of individual ascertaining

1088
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,839
the truth from proving the social

1089
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,400
process or conveying the truth

1090
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,759
i look forward to a world that make

1091
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,800
notions and moral

1092
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,400
truly distinct moral

1093
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:51,280
and technology never accept a model

1094
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,520
without a technique never accept a

1095
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,839
notion without a theory

1096
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,359
who wants to live in a cheap obstruction

1097
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,799
so long we have the will

1098
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:04,000
and the ability to construct one

1099
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,280
darling how was the conference oh it was

1100
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,760
marvelous a sublime experience

1101
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,040
somebody said the universe is blue with

1102
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,359
a red stripe

1103
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,040
some said that is a frozen melody on a

1104
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:19,040
frog pong

1105
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:22,640
marvelous nonsense moral and tech

1106
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,279
together or nothing

1107
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,839
mortal threats what is the highest

1108
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,400
threat

1109
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:33,759
to our morals global warming

1110
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,480
yes global warming is afraid to our

1111
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,960
morals

1112
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,000
what else nuclear war yeah

1113
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,040
nuclear war is bad for our morals

1114
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,040
what else a young biologist disaster has

1115
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,440
been broken just now

1116
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,319
yes yes yes but after global warming

1117
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,559
nuclear war

1118
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,040
plague social collapse what is the

1119
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:59,040
highest threat to our morals

1120
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,759
the bubble attack bingo

1121
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,800
linguistic disunity might indeed

1122
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,839
disintegrate

1123
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,520
our community we worry a lot about

1124
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,078
attacks within a model

1125
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
but the most dangerous one is outside

1126
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,760
the model

1127
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,279
our community will not be brought down

1128
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,800
by lack of creativity

1129
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,040
by but by linguistic sabotage

1130
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,400
the moment someone for maliciousness or

1131
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,800
vanity abandons

1132
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,760
language continuity to use a name of

1133
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,839
fantasy

1134
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,040
and or that goldrick is on vacation

1135
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,319
somewhere

1136
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,839
and a few people will do dutifully side

1137
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,839
gone with the wind whatever

1138
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,040
we'll find ourselves living in separate

1139
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,319
and uncommunicating worlds

1140
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,480
only a few profits distrust the profit

1141
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,319
to be sure will be able to perceive the

1142
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,800
unity in multiplicity

1143
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,839
everyone else will leave alone in his

1144
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,160
own cocoon

1145
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,078
so tied up that she will not be able to

1146
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,680
reach anyone else

1147
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,720
communication works because of ambiguity

1148
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,279
use old loaded words

1149
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,640
and you live some form of common

1150
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,760
understanding

1151
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:13,440
use new words and you have nothing

1152
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,000
in common and now for a fundamental

1153
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,839
question

1154
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,839
how many morals does a field need

1155
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,839
well different fields different answers

1156
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,359
differently for computer science i heard

1157
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,960
we value a fact we

1158
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,279
rarely introduce new models so spock

1159
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,559
a referee on the field that never better

1160
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,920
remains anonymous

1161
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,240
i love that i am with it man

1162
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,960
from sleep to a time of sleep no drama

1163
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,319
no fear

1164
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,040
the question is any life

1165
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,599
in our community we are going to need as

1166
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,680
many morals are necessary to express our

1167
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,000
creativity

1168
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,359
which apparently is this very much very

1169
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,680
immoral so much so

1170
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,720
that if you better get a taxi to if you

1171
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,720
want to stand in line

1172
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,559
morals as a language everyone knows

1173
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,279
that the moral is a mean to represent

1174
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,000
thought

1175
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,559
but few realize that the progression the

1176
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,079
abundance and the efficiency of thought

1177
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,240
are effects of the moral actually

1178
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,359
hugo foscolo one of the greatest italian

1179
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,640
points by the way

1180
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:26,880
never said that but he said this about

1181
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,759
the word language and actually what he

1182
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,960
said is true

1183
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,920
above morals as well in fact

1184
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,160
the intellectual ecosystem in my view

1185
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,160
morals occupy a central position

1186
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,200
so much so that is legitimate to ask

1187
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,118
whether there can be

1188
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,118
any deep thinking without models

1189
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,920
morals and history the intellectual

1190
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:53,200
success story of cryptography in these

1191
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,000
40 years is stunning it does

1192
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,078
revolutionize

1193
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,079
the way we think about and deal with

1194
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,119
seekers authenticity knowledge improves

1195
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,920
security randomness

1196
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,359
few parallels in history one must go to

1197
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,160
quantum mechanic days

1198
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,720
of over a year ago to the community of

1199
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,279
plank

1200
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,118
borg einstein eisenberg etcetera to find

1201
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,599
an equally impetuous and inspiring

1202
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,599
community

1203
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,839
such success raised to eternal question

1204
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,598
why why do such community suddenly

1205
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,480
materialize

1206
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,480
how do they inspire so much following

1207
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,160
the answers may be multiple

1208
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,480
but they are usually investigated by

1209
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,960
historians of the future

1210
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,200
i feel that a bit more contemporaneous

1211
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,559
reflection in occasion of our 40th

1212
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,078
anniversary may be

1213
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,960
appropriate my answer is that

1214
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,440
the beauty the openness and the courage

1215
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
of

1216
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,599
our models of their morals of every

1217
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,439
community

1218
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,359
of any community who wants to shake up

1219
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,880
the world is really

1220
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,480
what attracts the youngest and the

1221
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,160
brightest

1222
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,920
these are what attracts the people are

1223
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,078
not afraid to fail

1224
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,240
those who welcome novelties and

1225
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,839
immigrants from other fields

1226
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,078
those who are not repulsive but

1227
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,799
outlandish theory

1228
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,119
those who embrace experimentation who

1229
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,760
want to master a new language to express

1230
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,440
crazy new thoughts we want to civilize

1231
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,240
the vast and unexplored with

1232
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,280
wilderness we want to gain a deeper

1233
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,959
understanding

1234
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,240
of themselves and the universe

1235
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,400
our community any community that matters

1236
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,399
is the one around our morals

1237
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,119
we are our morals so

1238
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,839
until death breaks us apart until

1239
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,040
linguistic

1240
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:47,839
discourse breaks us apart until

1241
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,400
our creativity stops flowing let us

1242
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,839
create

1243
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,839
new worlds in which all want to live in

1244
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,960
so long live our morals and long

1245
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,960
live cryptography thank you very much

1246
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,200
let's see thank you silio i really

1247
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,599
appreciate your talk

1248
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,879
i want to remind people to ask questions

1249
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,960
over either

1250
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,400
zoomchat or zulip with zulu preferred

1251
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,520
and i will moderate them and let me

1252
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,280
throw out

1253
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,280
the first question if i may

1254
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,760
your your friend and co-conspirator

1255
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,839
shafi goldwasser was

1256
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,760
once at a restaurant when she ran out of

1257
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,078
her beverage she asked the waiter

1258
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,520
whether they have the notion of a refill

1259
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,040
and the waiter said

1260
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,040
we have refills but what is a notion

1261
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,160
and so i want to ask you the same

1262
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,800
question you you tried to explain uh

1263
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,720
that

1264
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,319
that notions and models are the same but

1265
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,319
what exactly then is a notion

1266
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:56,319
okay i think we are to

1267
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:00,319
accept the secularity business here so

1268
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:03,599
my old point so far has been that

1269
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,599
morals is really

1270
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,040
a morals are different until we prove

1271
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,240
them different

1272
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,200
by having concocting something else

1273
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,558
in which somehow i show them separate in

1274
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,879
my opinion you know

1275
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,599
you cannot differentiate a notion of a

1276
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,880
model if you want a moral is a notion of

1277
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,160
legs and a notion of a moral knowledge

1278
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,960
so i really think that we have to

1279
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,960
see if i can actually see you as well

1280
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,079
when i talk that is a bit hard for me to

1281
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:38,000
do

1282
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:40,640
but uh eventually maybe i'll succeed

1283
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,599
um okay well i i came to succeed

1284
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,359
apparently

1285
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,480
so um so i really think of it you know

1286
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,799
somehow

1287
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,720
a moral is a really the way in which you

1288
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,359
know we understand the world

1289
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,319
and uh and somehow we create a community

1290
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,240
around it

1291
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,240
and i believe of it you know to try to

1292
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,680
differentiate the notion from a model

1293
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,680
it doesn't make any sense

1294
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,839
thank you

1295
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,839
questions you can also raise your hand

1296
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,640
in the participants list and i can try

1297
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,839
to unmute you

1298
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,839
if i manage

1299
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,760
[Music]

1300
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:48,799
all right now i see something that's

1301
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:50,640
good okay you guys came back

1302
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,960
we have a question from shai can you say

1303
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,359
a few more words about what is the right

1304
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,359
theorem

1305
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,160
well right theorem so i remember that

1306
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,000
you know

1307
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:07,279
i wanna my mentor

1308
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,960
was a shimon even and uh

1309
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,400
who passed away a few years back and uh

1310
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,200
i was uh i loved the man

1311
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,400
and so what he said is the right answer

1312
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,558
to this other question

1313
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,119
he says you know so what is a proof a

1314
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,599
proof is something that convinces me

1315
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,760
so let me tell you the right moral is in

1316
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,720
the in the eyes of the beholder

1317
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,920
so somehow but is that our best way that

1318
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,839
we are done

1319
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,960
adding a model because a model in which

1320
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,960
you cannot prove anything

1321
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,960
it doesn't matter you can actually have

1322
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,480
a model which is so in a physical sense

1323
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,359
which is closer and closer and closer to

1324
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,359
reality like

1325
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,440
you can't actually work with it is too

1326
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,160
hard is is useless

1327
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,160
and so we have to accept that somehow we

1328
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,040
are the masters of the universe and what

1329
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,078
convinces us to be the right theorem is

1330
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,040
really works

1331
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,160
all i can tell you is that um throughout

1332
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,319
my life i found

1333
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,279
that in very fundamental things when i

1334
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,279
really think

1335
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,640
this is the right theorem by magic

1336
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,040
everybody else agrees

1337
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,160
so what is a true theorem for me is also

1338
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,160
true film for you

1339
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,839
one of his magic film which is worth

1340
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,839
creating a new moral for

1341
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,240
john jacques couture says your talk

1342
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,960
about models is a model for us

1343
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,598
and we put in the ethology of cryptology

1344
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,920
okay

1345
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:37,680
great thanks glenn glad to hear

1346
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,359
thanks john jacques can you hear me or i

1347
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,040
need to be unmuted

1348
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,440
daniella you're on i can hear you okay

1349
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,558
okay good good so hey

1350
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,880
so um you were suggesting that

1351
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,079
uh i mean models are good the more the

1352
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,200
better but i mean

1353
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,720
coming up with models is not easy

1354
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,399
and even understanding models is not

1355
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,319
easy it takes more than just reading the

1356
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,280
definition it takes

1357
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,759
experience and so there is a cost every

1358
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,160
time

1359
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,520
a new model is introduced there is a

1360
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,558
substantial cost

1361
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,799
for the community to understand accept

1362
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,160
it

1363
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,359
use it and move on and in

1364
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,640
often models you can have the models

1365
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,839
that are different levels of

1366
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,078
abstractions

1367
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,960
but they are still somehow compatible

1368
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,920
you can

1369
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,359
try to explain one model in term of the

1370
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,480
other one

1371
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,359
and you can so is there something that

1372
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,400
you think

1373
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,520
so far has been really a

1374
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,040
fundamental step forward that

1375
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:44,240
new models will build on in the past

1376
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,640
rather than just different independent

1377
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,240
models that are built from scratch

1378
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,720
all right so i'm not sure what i can

1379
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,640
remember at all but i will try my best

1380
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,359
so first of all i want to clarify that i

1381
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,680
didn't say the more morals were better

1382
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,000
i mean that is the way it's similar to

1383
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,118
say the more papers one writes of a

1384
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,599
the better you know papers matter some

1385
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,640
papers

1386
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,400
sometimes one paper but a very write

1387
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,118
paper is better than

1388
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,520
many many papers as we all know so i was

1389
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,880
just

1390
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,799
noticing that while some other community

1391
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,359
they coagulate among themselves by

1392
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,480
keeping the model fixed

1393
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:24,240
and changing once every 25 years

1394
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,520
we have managed to do the opposite we

1395
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,240
managed to

1396
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,160
coagulate our community recruit people

1397
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,399
from the best parts of science

1398
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,240
behaving and actually challenging our

1399
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,799
morals and periodically changing

1400
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,000
it wasn't just an observation that we

1401
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:41,440
naturally produce

1402
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,119
more more morals than others

1403
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,680
but you are right that the moral

1404
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:49,760
requires you know

1405
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:53,440
an investment as i learned

1406
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:57,200
from my former student uh leo

1407
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,680
and we make kids uh every seven years to

1408
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,879
keep up

1409
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,839
with the tech i think i might say that i

1410
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,079
want to produce

1411
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:06,160
one student every seven years to so that

1412
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,520
i can explain the new models

1413
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,680
so it's uh somehow similar and but

1414
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,040
but but somehow you know we have to

1415
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,919
accept that when we get

1416
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,720
tired of the learning new model when we

1417
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,240
take tired

1418
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,240
of investing in new model the time must

1419
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,598
come to do something else because

1420
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,879
the dynamicity of our field requires

1421
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,359
this ability to do new um

1422
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,359
to get into into new moral i don't

1423
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,119
believe it is a fashion i believe of it

1424
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,598
you know

1425
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,880
we create by the way many new morals and

1426
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,440
the one we keep on

1427
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,000
on cutting forward but i think that you

1428
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,000
know

1429
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,799
the beauty of these morals is that they

1430
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,799
are very beautiful they are very deep

1431
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,520
they somehow um speak to us because they

1432
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,440
talk about

1433
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,720
privacy identity things that we are

1434
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,400
really interested on

1435
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,319
and and they are actually as crazy as

1436
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,720
he's a quantum

1437
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,400
mechanics model i mean a claude loves

1438
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,919
the quantum mechanics and works in it in

1439
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,480
the intersection of cryptography

1440
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,520
but the analogy is really you cannot

1441
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,480
know

1442
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,960
to me everything is a model there is no

1443
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,880
much

1444
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,240
a difference in the physical science and

1445
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,119
a field like ours

1446
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,640
but you have to go sometimes too

1447
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,880
expressive and expressible

1448
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,359
to do something very different and these

1449
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,720
guys rather than being uh revolts oh my

1450
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,200
god what are these morals

1451
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,839
they run with it and so i think that you

1452
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,319
know

1453
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,078
it is a testament to our vitality these

1454
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,720
morals i but i don't

1455
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,119
necessarily advocate that you just is a

1456
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,598
moral counting that no proliferation of

1457
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,720
uh

1458
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:46,400
unnecessary moral signifies progress

1459
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:49,520
and but i i believe that

1460
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,520
at the end of the day our

1461
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,440
greatest contribution to the world

1462
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,160
really

1463
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,119
are the moral the way we break up a

1464
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,799
reality

1465
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:04,079
and observe it and try to tame it both

1466
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:06,160
not the reality of the outside world but

1467
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,520
the internal reality whatever we want to

1468
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,720
express because

1469
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,920
somehow uh

1470
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,959
a field changes but the morals are stay

1471
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,039
and the morals are much more primitive

1472
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,559
they are like language i don't really

1473
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,079
think there is a

1474
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,520
rigorous thinking without morals

1475
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,599
uh ron you had a question would you like

1476
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,720
to ask it in person sure

1477
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,400
so yeah wonderful talk so

1478
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,640
there's a famous quote about models

1479
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,720
which i don't remember who said it

1480
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,480
but it relates very much to your talk it

1481
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,879
says that all models are wrong

1482
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,079
but some are useful and i'm not sure

1483
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,480
that the

1484
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,920
speaker of this quote was thinking about

1485
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,039
models the same way you do perhaps you

1486
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,559
have some comments about

1487
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,559
that quote all models are wrong

1488
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,960
look i uh i need a bit of context i

1489
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,520
think i

1490
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,240
provided you know an example of a more

1491
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,599
than

1492
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:04,640
as an example of a context and uh

1493
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:07,280
but certainly you

1494
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,558
i think of it whoever says it is right

1495
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,359
in the sense

1496
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,359
that the real enjoyment is in the

1497
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,640
journey not in the destination

1498
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:20,319
and so in this fashion i really believe

1499
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,680
that morals are useful because they do

1500
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,119
represent

1501
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:27,759
our journey into a better comprehension

1502
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,280
of what are we doing here and what the

1503
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,319
world is about

1504
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:35,520
and uh and unfortunately for us

1505
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,000
the world seems to be as creative as we

1506
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,640
are

1507
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,440
and that is a kind of a magic uh

1508
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,759
connection

1509
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,799
between i believe uh us as human or in

1510
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,039
individuals

1511
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,880
and uh in the world out there so i don't

1512
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,839
believe that is going to be the ultimate

1513
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,079
model for anything

1514
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,759
but uh i believe that the moral itself

1515
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,680
it speaks about the community what

1516
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,440
they believed in and what they wanted to

1517
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,480
approach you know life and science are

1518
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,920
better than anything else

1519
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,680
let's do a couple more questions we're

1520
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,640
running um into a break but it's a long

1521
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,200
break so we have time

1522
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,078
um kevin uh mccurry you had a question

1523
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,240
and do you want to

1524
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,400
ask it in person yeah it's actually

1525
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,200
related to ron's question

1526
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,119
and this statement that all models are

1527
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,399
wrong but some are useful has seen a

1528
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,119
resurgence of interest

1529
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,960
lately because of the advent of machine

1530
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,839
learning the extreme power of machine

1531
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,319
learning

1532
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,759
to replace rule-based systems for making

1533
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:30,640
predictions

1534
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,000
and it occurs to me that when we create

1535
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,078
a model

1536
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,079
we create a model in an adversarial

1537
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,200
situation where the adversary can create

1538
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,280
their own model

1539
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,319
so for example we create a model of

1540
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,960
communication

1541
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,079
on the internet which involves routing

1542
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,520
and

1543
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,000
fragmentation of packets and

1544
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,359
packetization and then the adversary can

1545
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,480
create a model

1546
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:55,759
based on observing the data and try to

1547
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,760
make inference from that to derive

1548
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,960
information about the underlying

1549
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,720
communication

1550
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,799
so these are two models that have been

1551
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,799
constructed perhaps by a cryptanalyst

1552
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:07,038
to analyze the data to try to make some

1553
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:09,119
inference using only the data

1554
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,200
and another model which is constructed

1555
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,559
with rules to say how communication

1556
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,160
should be constructed

1557
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,839
these are completely different kinds of

1558
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,558
models but they're in conflict with each

1559
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,799
other they're in battle with each other

1560
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,000
so do you have any thoughts about the

1561
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,240
this way of thinking

1562
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,799
about computer science with machine

1563
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,520
learning and how it applies to

1564
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:30,160
construction of models because when a

1565
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,759
when a

1566
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,359
machine learning expert talks about a

1567
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,359
model they talk about only about

1568
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,558
inferring stuff from the data

1569
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,799
they don't have a mathematical

1570
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,359
conception of the model in any way other

1571
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,319
than

1572
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,598
inference from the data well i had a

1573
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,839
slide for that too

1574
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,839
so i think that there was a atomos

1575
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:50,078
meaning being a cryptography to hold up

1576
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:51,119
the world i think we should subsume you

1577
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,400
know

1578
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:57,760
frankly machine learning and do it right

1579
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:01,200
so i'm um i think that uh we certainly

1580
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,000
have a history of uh over working you

1581
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,680
know

1582
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,520
in other fields and coming up with

1583
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,399
insight and to be receptive to the

1584
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,839
insides of our

1585
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,640
other fields as well and um i think

1586
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,839
that this is uh something that certainly

1587
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,359
we should uh

1588
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:18,240
we should do but at some more primitive

1589
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:22,480
level

1590
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:24,799
so you cannot realize that i know

1591
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,440
the notion of intelligence used to be

1592
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:30,559
this very abstract things

1593
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,760
it reminds me when biology failed to

1594
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,839
vietnam

1595
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,760
organic molecules could not be created

1596
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,400
in the laboratory why because of our

1597
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,960
organic

1598
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,400
how could you create an organic molecule

1599
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,119
until somebody and

1600
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,280
somehow produce a urea or whatever and

1601
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,240
we say oh okay this is not true

1602
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,200
scratch of it so and so i really believe

1603
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,240
that you know there were

1604
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,960
a vague smoky notion of intelligence and

1605
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,279
i think that

1606
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,160
machine learning is actually brought to

1607
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,760
light

1608
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,000
vita like life comes out or nothing

1609
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,480
which

1610
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,160
will be very poetic by the way if

1611
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,039
somehow

1612
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,480
from material with starting bacteria and

1613
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,280
soon enough we have

1614
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,319
animals and then we have us height so

1615
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,520
and i believe also

1616
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,038
i find it very poetic that intelligence

1617
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,079
and consciousness and everything else

1618
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,960
comes from a very

1619
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,079
simple rules i find nothing wrong with

1620
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,119
it so i think

1621
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:28,720
this model is a major has been a major

1622
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:32,559
step forward in a to

1623
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:35,759
the pre-scientific approach to

1624
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:40,079
um to intelligence however i feel

1625
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:42,559
that you know um adversarial learning is

1626
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:44,640
is in desperate need and i understand

1627
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,760
that this effort has been uh

1628
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:50,879
started already i did not uh ever yet

1629
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,280
at the time to pay any attention to it

1630
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,079
but seems to me that you know learning

1631
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,480
is about

1632
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,160
is an adversarial process man right so

1633
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,359
the first thing you have to do is that

1634
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,279
you know to save away

1635
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,960
all the wrong information you have to

1636
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,000
unlearn all the wrong

1637
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,760
things that i've learned and uh and as

1638
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,319
you know whatever you learn early

1639
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,599
isn't changed for a very long time and

1640
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:15,759
so you have to fight a

1641
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:18,400
way way way back to uh

1642
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,759
to change your view and uh i think of it

1643
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,519
you know

1644
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,560
a theory of machine learning without an

1645
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:28,239
adversary is not going to go very far

1646
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,319
so they need our help and we need

1647
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,678
their injection of help in our field i

1648
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,319
think the two of them will be a

1649
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,319
fantastic

1650
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,839
marriage

1651
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:51,040
so i guess we

1652
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,318
we are running over time but silva has

1653
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,679
been a great talk

1654
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:58,480
and you generate a lot of interaction

1655
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,719
i would like to thank you for for

1656
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:03,439
accepting to give this lecture

1657
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,158
i i actually i'd like to instead thank

1658
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,639
you again

1659
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:08,080
for the kind invitation for all the

1660
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,120
effort of doing this

1661
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,759
i think it is uh wonderful and uh again

1662
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,960
uh

1663
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,158
uh congratulations guys let's keep

1664
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,799
pushing the envelope i think we are

1665
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,639
on to something and uh when going gets

1666
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:26,080
tough uh the task gets going

1667
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,120
so my prediction is we will keep on

1668
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,920
going

1669
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,479
thanks all right so before ending the

1670
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,880
session

1671
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,879
the
