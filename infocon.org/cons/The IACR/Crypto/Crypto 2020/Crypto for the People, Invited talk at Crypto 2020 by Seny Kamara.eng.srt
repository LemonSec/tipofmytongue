1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,200
good to go

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
okay great uh welcome everybody to the

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,799
uh

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
invited uh talk session um

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,080
it's my distinct privilege to introduce

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
uh our invited speaker

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,959
senior senior is an associate professor

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
at brown university where he directs the

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
encrypted systems lab

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,240
and has affiliations with the caps group

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,599
the data science initiative

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
and the center for human rights and

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,520
humanitarian studies and he's also

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,280
currently chief scientist at

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,320
urokai systems previously sunny spent

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
several years at microsoft research so

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
sony's research in cryptography

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
is really driven by rural problems from

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
privacy security and surveillance

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
and uh you know over the years he's had

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,840
many seminal contributions to the field

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,079
uh you know particularly and it's been

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
very influential for my own work uh

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
his uh contributions on formal notions

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,000
and schemes for efficiently searching

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,640
encrypted data which

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640
has had really lasting impact both on on

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
theory and in deployed systems that are

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
used in practice

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
and lately and very interestingly he's

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
also been building curriculum and

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,439
outreach efforts and kind of online

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,400
blogs and and other uh conversation

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,399
starters

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
to help try to steer cryptography

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
towards better serving uh marginalized

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
groups

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
so with that i'll turn it over to sunny

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
and just remind everyone that

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
please add to the question for a

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
question answer session at the end

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,000
uh please add your questions to zuliper

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,479
zoom chat and danielle and i will

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
uh we'll keep an eye out for that please

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
take it away sonny

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,240
great thank you tom um yeah so first i'd

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
like to you know

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
thank the crypto organizers for the

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
invitation

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
uh it's a great honor to be giving an

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
invited talk at crypto

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
and also want to thank them for

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,759
organizing such a great event especially

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
on the current circumstances i can't

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
imagine

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,559
how difficult but challenging that must

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
have been

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
so uh yeah the title of my talk is

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
crypto for the people

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
um and as a disclaimer

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
i want to say that this is not a

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
technical talk so i won't be

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
you know describing any cryptographic

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,239
protocol or any cryptographic algorithm

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
i won't be talking about how to search

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
for enter the data

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and so a natural question then is okay

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,000
well what am i doing here right

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
why am i giving a talk at crypto if i'm

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,080
not talking about technical things

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,080
and you know basically i'm here because

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,400
uh ahmad aubry was killed um in february

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
because brianna taylor was killed by

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
police officers

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
in march and because george floyd was

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,040
also killed by police officers

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,480
in may and these killings

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,200
among many others sparked

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,319
outrage and anger across the united

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,518
states

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,480
but also throughout the world and

82
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,360
given this context and this background

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,119
um

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,360
it also turns out that i'm one of the

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
few or if not the only or maybe one of

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
two or three

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,040
black cryptographers and so

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
when i was thinking about what i would

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
talk about today um

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
you know i was thinking like well should

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,079
i talk about crypto like should i talk

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
about a particular crypto algorithm

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,400
you know and given everything that was

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,760
going on in the world i thought you know

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
no right like frankly who cares

96
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,280
right about a particular particular

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
scheme or something

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,840
um and so what i decided to talk about

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,839
was about

100
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,720
perspective and in particular my

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
perspective

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,400
on crypto as a black person as an

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,798
immigrant

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
as an applied cryptographer and more

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
broadly as

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,958
a an outsider and

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
of course the thing about perspective is

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,920
that it's it's very subjective

109
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
right so this is my perspective which is

110
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
informed by my life experiences

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,040
um and and what i experience you know

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,439
uh every day and of course different

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
people

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
experience different things that may

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
have a different perspective and that's

116
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,959
okay

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
so you may disagree with with my point

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
of view

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
um and the things that i'm gonna say uh

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,159
but that's all right

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
and the point of my talk is not to

122
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,599
convince you that my perspective is the

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
right one

124
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
the goal of my talk is just to express

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
this perspective because it's a

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,919
perspective that i don't think

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
has been expressed within the crypto

128
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,840
community

129
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,320
um and it's a perspective that will

130
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,039
probably not be expressed at least

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,599
uh you know at conference like crypto

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
for

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,680
probably you know a very long time

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,440
so okay so with that being said um

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,919
let's talk about crypto so

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
one thing that i think we can all agree

137
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
on

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,639
is that cryptography has had an enormous

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,880
impact on the world i mean this is

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,560
uh you know this is an obvious i think

141
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,080
an obvious statement

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
um cryptanalysis is estimated to have

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
shortened

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
world war ii by two years and to have

145
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639
saved 40 million lives

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
which is an incredible impact right just

147
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
just on its own

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
this is this is an amazing

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,160
accomplishment

150
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
you know we all know that crypto is

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
fundamental to electronic commerce and

152
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,159
to banking and to data security and

153
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
privacy

154
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
banking alone is a 40 trillion dollar

155
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,198
industry you know and it would be very

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
very difficult to do banking without

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,440
encryption

158
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,840
um without digital signatures

159
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
and this estimates that aes alone right

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,679
this one

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
single primitive has contributed 250

162
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,840
billion to the u.s economy

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
you know which is which is staggering um

164
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,080
that's

165
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,880
that's amazing um

166
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,080
and we're living at a you know we're

167
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,039
living through

168
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
um i think a really exciting moment in

169
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
cryptography where

170
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,199
modern cryptography and a lot of the

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
primitives and the protocols

172
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
that we're designing and that we're

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
inventing um

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
you know are are starting to be applied

175
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
right so so we have of course things

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
like block ciphers and hash functions

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
but you know we have like completed ram

178
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,120
and cell knowledge proofs privates and

179
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
intersection blockchains

180
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
differential privacy anonymous

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
credentials but all of these amazing

182
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
things that

183
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
that as a community we've invented um

184
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
you know for somebody like me who is an

185
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
applied cryptographer it's very exciting

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
to see that some subsidies are actually

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
being

188
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
used in practice and so as an example we

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,198
know that differential privacy is being

190
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
used

191
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,360
by the census bureau uh google is using

192
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
differential privacy

193
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
apple is using differential privacy zero

194
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
knowledge proofs

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,360
are being used by startups like zcash

196
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,198
and and ethereum uh google

197
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
announced i think it was last year that

198
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,960
they were using private set intersection

199
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
um and pc has been deployed uh of course

200
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
with the famous

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
sugar beet auction but you know it's

202
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
also been deployed um

203
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,280
um in other spaces i i believe goldman

204
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,960
sachs has invested in npc this

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,799
could be wrong so you know don't quote

206
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
me on this but um

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
and i know that encrypted search has

208
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,880
also been uh deployed by

209
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,400
mongodb and it's been invested in

210
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,520
heavily by

211
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,840
ayorpa which is the

212
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
the intelligence agency's uh funding

213
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,359
agency

214
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,280
so this is all really impressive um

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
it's it's it's quite amazing and it's

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,638
exciting

217
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,720
um and one thing that is

218
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
always on my mind that i always think

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
about um this is just sort of like a

220
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
natural thing that i'm always wondering

221
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,680
about is who exactly benefits

222
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
from crypto and one thing that's clear

223
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
is that

224
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
corporations definitely benefit from

225
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
cryptography right we've seen that you

226
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
know

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
on the previous slide for example google

228
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,799
apple and mongodb for example definitely

229
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,599
benefit from crypto um

230
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
it's also clear that government agencies

231
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,240
benefit from crypto

232
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,879
right um clearly we have

233
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,039
um the u.s census bureau for example

234
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,319
benefiting from crypto

235
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,680
and we also or it's also clear at least

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
to me that venture capitalists are

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
benefiting from crypto

238
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,479
right by backing certain startups like

239
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,680
cash or ethereum

240
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,878
um i think my animations are yeah are

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,960
inverted um so this

242
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,280
to me at least is clear right i know

243
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,919
that corporations

244
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,799
governments and government agencies

245
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
startups

246
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
and venture capitalists are benefiting

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
from cryptography

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
but one thing that's less clear to me or

249
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,638
that's not obvious to me

250
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
is whether people are benefiting from

251
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
cryptography and in particular whether

252
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,519
marginalized people are benefiting from

253
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,120
photography

254
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
um that's something that i ask myself

255
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,880
all the time that i've asked myself

256
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
uh for years right since i've been in

257
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
this community it's for me it's a

258
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,200
natural question because you know

259
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,640
i'm part of these marginalized groups

260
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,640
um and so you may say okay well

261
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,000
look like um sure people benefit from

262
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,959
cryptography right it's it's

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
a pipeline so we're going to design some

264
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,518
protocol and we're going to write some

265
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
research paper and we're going to

266
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,640
publish it and then a company is going

267
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,479
to come along and take this paper

268
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
and they're going to create some amazing

269
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
piece of technology that people are

270
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,399
going to benefit from right this

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
technology is going to be secure and

272
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
private thanks to our protocols and our

273
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
algorithms

274
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
and you may also say you know and same

275
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
thing for government government is going

276
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,720
to take the research that we produce

277
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,160
and they're going to build all kinds of

278
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
you know really cool and secure

279
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
infrastructure

280
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,760
and people are going to benefit from

281
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,680
that okay so so what's the problem here

282
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,760
and to me this argument like is

283
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,199
it's not really convincing right it's

284
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,120
it's it's an argument but

285
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,680
but i'm not sure i buy it

286
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,880
you know for for starters like companies

287
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,079
don't view their users necessarily as

288
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
people right they view them

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,519
as an opportunity uh to make money

290
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
um governments or i shouldn't say

291
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,080
governments actually like certain

292
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,439
government agencies

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,480
um view people you know on a spectrum

294
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
from citizen

295
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
to subject depending on on the context

296
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,199
and depending on who

297
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,079
the people are right so this argument

298
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,640
that

299
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,760
protography is gonna benefit people uh

300
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,720
because

301
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,000
it's uh you know because big tech

302
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,600
companies and because

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
government agencies are gonna use our

304
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,120
research is just yeah

305
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,160
it's not i'm not sure i buy

306
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,640
um you know we we've had

307
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,240
we've been producing crypto papers for

308
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
for 40 years

309
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
all kinds of amazing research uh but you

310
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,319
know tech companies

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
let's be honest have had a pretty poor

312
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,360
track record

313
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,160
on user privacy and security right um

314
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,240
we know now it's pretty clear that you

315
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
know for a lot of companies their users

316
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,200
are not necessarily their customers

317
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,240
right and it's not clear whether the

318
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
user's

319
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,600
interests are always aligned with their

320
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,800
real customers interests

321
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
we also know that users are not

322
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,439
monolithic and that big tech companies

323
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
don't necessarily cater equally to all

324
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
their users right this is really obvious

325
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
in certain fields like for machine

326
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,399
learning and ai where we have

327
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
you know machine learning models that

328
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,160
you know perform well on certain groups

329
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
and perform terribly on other groups

330
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
right um

331
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,360
training data that that is not diverse

332
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,040
and etc etc

333
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,640
right so you know i

334
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
whether big tech companies are going to

335
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,760
be the ones that that produce

336
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
uh crypto for for the people is is not

337
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
clear

338
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,319
same thing with you know some government

339
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
agencies right the nsa

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
ice fbi they spend money and they spend

341
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,800
political capital right we've seen them

342
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
do this to enroll privacy right so i

343
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,000
don't know if they're going to be

344
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,319
um the ones that we can count on either

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
so then i tell myself okay well you know

346
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,640
if silicon valley

347
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,160
isn't going to do it and if you know

348
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
certain government agencies aren't going

349
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,439
to do it well what about academia

350
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,040
right we live in the ivory tower and and

351
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
we're not burdened with having to think

352
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,519
about

353
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
the short term we can think long term

354
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
and we have academic freedom we have all

355
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
these things

356
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,519
then maybe this is something we can do

357
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
and

358
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,360
then i think about it you know more and

359
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,000
i'm not convinced of that either

360
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
to be honest so i spent eight years at

361
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,279
microsoft research and i spent

362
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
something like i don't know 10 years in

363
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,439
academia

364
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,399
and it wasn't that different right like

365
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
um

366
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
and this is something i think that

367
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,959
you'll hear a lot of people that are at

368
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
microsoft research say that msr is this

369
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,279
like

370
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
it's kind of like an academic department

371
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,959
mine is the teaching

372
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,638
and the way that we typically interpret

373
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,479
this the way that we think about this is

374
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
usually you say oh isn't msr this

375
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
amazing place right it's like you have

376
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,560
all this freedom you can do all these

377
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
amazing things and produce all this

378
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,800
amazing research and technology

379
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
it's wonderful and this is all true

380
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,000
but there's a flip side to this argument

381
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
right maybe

382
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
it's more that academia is kind of like

383
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,600
working in a corporate research lab

384
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,079
um and i don't think this

385
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
this this direction of the argument is

386
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,319
is you know

387
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,160
completely baseless right like

388
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
if you think about how we motivate a lot

389
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,839
of our research especially

390
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,439
people like me who are applied

391
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
photographers um

392
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,040
and work at the intersection of you know

393
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,040
crypto and systems or things like this

394
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
if you pull up any of you know our

395
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,079
papers right we motivate them

396
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
by you know by by by talking about how

397
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,880
practical

398
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
our protocols are how efficient they are

399
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,920
and what we're really trying to say

400
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,920
i think is you know this technology can

401
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,399
be deployed and it can be deployed

402
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,680
by who usually right by by tech

403
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,360
companies

404
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
um and let's be honest having your work

405
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
used by startup or a big company is a

406
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,239
big deal

407
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
right as an academic it demonstrates

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
real world impact

409
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
it increases your chances of getting

410
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
funding it increases your chances of

411
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,680
getting tenure

412
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
okay um and so

413
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
as i was thinking about this like you

414
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,240
know i i also

415
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,000
realized that most universities have an

416
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
office of technology transfer

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,079
um and i recognized technology transfer

418
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
you know from my years at microsoft

419
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,560
research where this was a part of

420
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
part of our mandate you know uh transfer

421
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,359
technology

422
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
and i was looking around at some

423
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
websites of different office of

424
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,079
technology transfers at universities and

425
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,439
and there was one that i think

426
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
encapsulates kind of you know

427
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
um what these offices do i i redacted

428
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,719
the university

429
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,319
it's it's not brown it's some other

430
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
university and

431
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
you know the website says something like

432
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,439
you or said the the university of ex

433
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,199
office of technology transfer is

434
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
responsible for bringing inventions

435
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,199
arising from university of x

436
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,120
research to society you know and

437
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,040
it's it's like it's and i was thinking

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
is is this true is this really sure is

439
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
this

440
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,519
or is this just a story that we tell

441
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,599
ourselves right like when we say

442
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
that we're bringing this to society what

443
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
we're really saying is that

444
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,120
um we're bringing this to industry and

445
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,880
then industry

446
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:55,120
will hopefully maybe one day bring it

447
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,040
to the right to people um

448
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,480
and so you know i'm not really sure

449
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,839
if um academia

450
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
at least in its current state and at

451
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,519
least in our field has

452
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,399
the right incentives or the right

453
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,760
motivation to really create technology

454
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,839
for people and in particular for

455
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,360
marginalized people

456
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,320
um okay so you may say like

457
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,560
fine um you know big tech it's not you

458
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,480
know maybe big tech isn't gonna do it

459
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,040
maybe uh you know government agencies

460
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
maybe won't do it academia i don't know

461
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,599
but what about grassroots technology

462
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
movements

463
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,320
right what about for example the open

464
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,560
source the open source community

465
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,680
and and this makes sense like the open

466
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
source community

467
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,439
you know has done amazing work over the

468
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
years right they've produced

469
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
great software lack of the highest

470
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,240
quality

471
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,120
um they've made it freely available um

472
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,680
and and that's a wonderful thing like

473
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
that's

474
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,560
awesome um but the open source community

475
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,040
is focused on on or it's sort of like

476
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,638
the

477
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,839
the motivation for the open source

478
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,040
community and here of course i'm you

479
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
know i'm being a bit reductive

480
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,319
there's many you know it's a broad

481
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,199
movement with many different you know

482
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,480
kind of

483
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,479
um ways of thinking you know but overall

484
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,160
a lot of the motivation comes from you

485
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,440
know freeing software from

486
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,920
from from the corporations okay which is

487
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,279
great

488
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,360
and really really valuable um

489
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,720
and then i think of a different

490
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
grassroots community

491
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
which is the cypherpunks uh the

492
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,160
cypherpunk movement

493
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
and you know the idea here is that we're

494
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
going to create all this cryptographic

495
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,880
software

496
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
encryption and and you know give it out

497
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,240
for free and people will be encrypting

498
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,758
their messages and they'll have privacy

499
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,959
and we're going to live in this like

500
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,639
super great private world that

501
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,040
governments you know and big brother

502
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,240
won't be able to break into

503
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,800
which is fantastic right like um

504
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,160
and one way to think about kind of what

505
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,160
the cypherpunk movement

506
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,439
is worried about right their adversary

507
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
the adversary that concerns the

508
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,839
cypherpunk movement

509
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,240
you know is government it's

510
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
organizations or agencies like the nsa

511
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
for example

512
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,958
um and of course there's a you know the

513
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,280
more recent movement of like blockchain

514
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,319
um and cryptocurrencies you know and

515
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
here the idea is we're gonna use

516
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
cryptography and we're gonna

517
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
decentralize everything so there's no

518
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,240
like central point of failure

519
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
there's no one person or one entity that

520
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
can control us

521
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,160
um you know we'll do it ourselves

522
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
um of course this gave rise to you know

523
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
to amazing technology to make a whole

524
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
wide range of amazing blockchain

525
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
technologies and here

526
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
if i had to summarize i'd say that the

527
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,120
adversary that this community is more

528
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,640
you know is focused on

529
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,959
um is you know central bankers

530
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,200
right um and and and governments as well

531
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
and so these movements have been really

532
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,000
influential

533
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,039
um and you know have had a huge impact

534
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,160
um and that's fantastic

535
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,440
but what i think about or what i wonder

536
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
about

537
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
because i can't help it is you know what

538
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,360
about the rest of us

539
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,879
so you know if i'm a 16 or 17 year old

540
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,159
black kid with a hoodie on going to the

541
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,280
store at night

542
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
my adversarial model doesn't include or

543
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
at least not immediately it doesn't

544
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,520
immediately include the nsa

545
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,679
that's not what i'm worried about right

546
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,120
i'm worried about uh the neighborhood

547
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
watch guy that's running around with a

548
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,639
gun

549
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,199
and i think he's a vigilante right

550
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
um you know when i grew up in new york

551
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,559
city and

552
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,679
when i was a teenager or by the time i

553
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,240
got to a certain age

554
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,840
right when i left the house my threat

555
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
model my adversarial model

556
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,918
was basically you know nypd that's what

557
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
i was worried about

558
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,320
when i was out at night um

559
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,880
if i'm a woman you know i may be worried

560
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
about

561
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,480
the nsa i may be worried about all of

562
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
these threats that the cypherpunks and

563
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
the open source movement is worried

564
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
about

565
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
but my threat model also includes you

566
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,000
know maybe my boss

567
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,160
or my professor or my mentor right

568
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,160
if i'm an immigrant maybe i'm worried

569
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,520
about central bankers but my more

570
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
immediate

571
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,039
threat right my my immediate adversarial

572
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,159
model includes

573
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
you know the department of homeland

574
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,120
security and ice

575
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,520
um and if i'm gay lesbian

576
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,879
or transgender then you know my

577
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,960
immediate threat model

578
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
includes religious fanatics and and

579
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
domestic terrorists

580
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,639
right and so

581
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
what i think about a lot of what is hard

582
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,160
for me to not think about

583
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,520
is you know who's going to make crypto

584
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
for marginalized people

585
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,120
right we've we're building on this

586
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,760
amazing cryptography

587
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,399
and it's having impact but is it having

588
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,960
impact

589
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
for the communities that i care about

590
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,640
for the

591
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,918
people around me um

592
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,799
and and and i don't

593
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,679
think you know i don't think it does and

594
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,679
so

595
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,320
i don't know if really like you know

596
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,240
myself or people that think like this

597
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,678
can rely on academia right maybe i'm

598
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,840
being a little bit harsh but

599
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,039
you know i think computer science

600
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
research is

601
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,080
you know in its current state it's

602
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,679
basically kind of like a free corporate

603
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
research lab

604
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,760
um the cypherpunks are concerned with

605
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
personal freedoms which of course

606
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,679
is super important right some of my work

607
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,799
is on surveillance

608
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,840
so clearly i think this is very very

609
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,879
valuable

610
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,520
um but the focus of that community often

611
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
is you know

612
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
personal freedom with respect to

613
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
government and intelligence agencies and

614
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,039
there's a very libertarian perspective

615
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,200
it's it's you know um

616
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,320
it's sort of a different focus and what

617
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,159
i'm concerned about

618
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
and when i say sort of crypto for the

619
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,200
people right what i'm

620
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,039
worried about what i'm concerned about

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
is um

622
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,039
cryptography and more broadly technology

623
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
that is concerned with fighting

624
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,840
oppression

625
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,158
and fighting violence from law

626
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,158
enforcement from the police from the fbi

627
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
from ice you know from social

628
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
hierarchies and norms

629
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,960
from domestic terrorists from the nazis

630
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,639
and the alt-right and white supremacists

631
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,320
and religious fanatics

632
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,760
and i don't know if if you know

633
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,360
the technology that we're producing is

634
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,919
is concerned about this or at least it's

635
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,678
not obvious to me

636
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,919
um so you may just say well okay well

637
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
look i design algorithms and i design

638
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,960
protocols right like

639
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
what am i gonna do okay this is what i

640
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,159
do um

641
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,960
and fair enough like that's true but

642
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,640
as scientists and researchers you have

643
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,960
agency right you make

644
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
decisions and you have and you make

645
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
decisions about

646
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
what you work on and in particular if

647
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
you have academic freedom

648
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,840
and you have tenure this allows you to

649
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,360
take risks right

650
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,559
and so you know when i think about

651
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,959
this this kind of motivation right this

652
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,799
this

653
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,840
type of research that is focused on

654
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,600
um you know on marginalized people

655
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,199
like it may not be obvious to come up

656
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,000
with examples of what this would look

657
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
like

658
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,720
and so i'm going to give you two

659
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,120
examples um

660
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
and one of them is is historic and the

661
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,158
other one is

662
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,678
is uh current something that we're

663
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,640
working on around

664
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
so the first one takes place in africa

665
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
um

666
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,600
in the mid 80s um and

667
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,919
in particular takes place in south

668
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,280
africa so south africa is it's a

669
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,600
country in the south of africa um

670
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
it has 57 million people eighty percent

671
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
of them are

672
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,158
are black uh eight point eight percent

673
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,439
of them are colored which in south

674
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,200
africa means basically

675
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,960
mixed uh you know people who are mixed

676
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
race um

677
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
eight point four percent of them are

678
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
white and two and a half percent are

679
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,960
indian and asian

680
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,080
okay so south africa

681
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,360
uh from 1948 to the early 1990s was

682
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
was um you know the way that it was

683
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
organized

684
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,360
was using apartheid right and apartheid

685
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
was a system of institutionalized racial

686
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,559
segregation

687
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,240
and so there was petty apartheid uh

688
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,760
which segregated people

689
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,840
uh you know sort of at the level of

690
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,760
facilities and events and

691
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,959
restaurants things like this and it was

692
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,679
grand apartheid which was more

693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
structural

694
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
and this segregated people in terms of

695
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,039
housing employment education

696
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,320
okay um so

697
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
in south africa there was you know the

698
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,240
african national congress which was

699
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,360
founded in 1912

700
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,000
um and the anc so if you've never heard

701
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,719
of the anc

702
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
this is nelson mandela's uh nelson

703
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,480
mandela's party

704
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,000
okay and so the anc was non-violent

705
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,640
until 1960

706
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
um basically until uh the sharkville

707
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120
massacre

708
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,559
where south african police opened fire

709
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,719
on protesters

710
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
and so at this point the anc became

711
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
banned um

712
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
they were banned from south africa its

713
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,480
leaders were

714
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,320
exiled all over the world and the nc

715
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,520
started to operate internationally

716
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,439
okay so um you know so there was people

717
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,559
in zambia people in london people

718
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,480
sort of everywhere um but the ac still

719
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,279
had operatives in south africa

720
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,080
okay and so because of this ban secure

721
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,480
communications

722
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,439
became critical to operations right so

723
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,320
like uh you know

724
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,919
a general that was somewhere um in

725
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,678
london needed to send messages to a

726
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
covert operative that was still in south

727
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,760
africa

728
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
okay and being able to communicate

729
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,000
securely was crucial to this

730
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,600
and so what they did is they used uh

731
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,840
different methods they use

732
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,918
secret inks and book codes and you know

733
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,918
all kinds of things that that

734
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
that they devised but in the end they

735
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,080
realized that it was really hard to use

736
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,760
and these techniques you know it was

737
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,960
they were very low bandwidth they were

738
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,679
kind of it was boring to to encrypt

739
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
manually um and so because of this

740
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,559
people

741
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,039
didn't really communicate as much as

742
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,678
they needed to

743
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,158
so in the mid 80s the anc decides to

744
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
develop

745
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,279
a communication system between all of

746
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,799
the different uh

747
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,720
you know all different locations from

748
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,760
which it was it was it was operating

749
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,720
and um the system had to satisfy

750
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,320
different properties right so uh it had

751
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,159
to be asynchronous because

752
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,520
parties couldn't necessarily be you know

753
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,360
i mean this wasn't the internet but they

754
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,480
couldn't be online quote unquote at the

755
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
same time

756
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
it had to be covert right because at the

757
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
time the use of encryption

758
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,039
and even the use of computers was

759
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,279
suspicious okay

760
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,080
um it had to handle long distances you

761
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
know and because

762
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,199
you were communicating let's say from

763
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,559
london you know to johannesburg there

764
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,159
was like

765
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,520
a huge amount of distance and a lot of

766
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,919
errors could be introduced into the

767
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,279
communication

768
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,240
and it also had to be um or

769
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,320
you know people also had to also needed

770
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,400
the ability to operate it in public

771
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,840
because at the time you know like

772
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
certain homes didn't have they have

773
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,639
phone lines

774
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,159
okay um so they would maybe have to go

775
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,159
to a phone booth

776
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,200
okay so these were all challenges that

777
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,760
they had to have to think about

778
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
and so here's a very high-level view of

779
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,320
the system

780
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,080
that they designed um which you know

781
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
i've been in the crypto community for

782
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,799
for what like

783
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,158
well in the computer science community

784
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,600
for almost 20 years and i've been in the

785
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,120
crypto community for

786
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,158
you know let's say 15 years um and i had

787
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
never heard of this

788
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
right um and i found this system and

789
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,918
this design you know

790
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,918
really amazing um and so i'm going to

791
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,400
try and describe it at a

792
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,440
at a high level um so here's the idea so

793
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,039
two people want to communicate um and

794
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,799
at the time so again this was like the

795
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,799
mid 80s and so

796
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,840
computers were available uh they just

797
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,200
weren't you know

798
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,120
they weren't ubiquitous but they were

799
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,520
available so

800
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,719
the nice thing about having access to

801
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,879
computers is that now

802
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,919
the encryption of the messages didn't

803
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
have to be done by hand they could be

804
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,720
done by computer which

805
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,240
meant that you could encrypt you know or

806
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
the users can encrypt a ton of

807
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
a ton of data right like large messages

808
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,159
so that was

809
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,520
a really positive development the

810
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,559
problem however is that you know

811
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,158
computers weren't

812
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,000
like i said weren't ubiquitous and also

813
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,720
computers kind of uh were suspicious

814
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
right because

815
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
like not that many people had them so

816
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
you know

817
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
these these computers were were put in

818
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
safe houses

819
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,960
okay so somebody so let's say the first

820
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,720
person was in cape town

821
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,400
the receiver was in johannesburg and

822
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
they would have a computer in some safe

823
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,240
house

824
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
okay so um they wrote programs to

825
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,799
encrypt their messages

826
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
right so the user would just send a

827
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,679
message to the computer and the computer

828
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,000
would spit out a ciphertext

829
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,279
okay and we'll see roughly what this

830
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
encryption scheme

831
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,640
um the description scheme looked like

832
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,600
so now given that we have a cipher text

833
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,760
uh the first

834
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,639
user or the sender needed to get this

835
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,960
message

836
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
to the computer of the receiver right

837
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,320
but again given the circumstances this

838
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,080
was a difficult thing to do

839
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,240
right because like ideally you would

840
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,320
just plug the computer to a modem

841
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,159
and then connect the modem to a phone

842
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,720
line and then they could communicate

843
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,320
but phone lines weren't just weren't

844
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
ubiquitous okay so that wasn't gonna

845
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
work

846
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,919
but they did realize that you know they

847
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,679
had

848
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,960
access to phone booths okay um

849
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,039
the problem with phone booths of course

850
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
is that they're public right

851
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,840
and if you take your computer and your

852
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
modem and you go to a phone booth and

853
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080
somehow try to connect it to the phone

854
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,439
booth that is going to look

855
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,120
really really obvious and really

856
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,039
suspicious okay

857
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,719
so what they did is they said okay they

858
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,520
they they tried a lot of different

859
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
techniques

860
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,240
um and they stumbled upon something

861
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,918
called an acoustic modem

862
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
and the nice thing about these acoustic

863
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
modems is that they had two really nice

864
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
properties one of them is that they

865
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
would produce

866
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,439
uh you know they would take the message

867
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
and convert it to some kind of sound

868
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,880
which was useful and you'll see why

869
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,960
uh next but also they were asynchronous

870
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,480
so these acoustic modems didn't have to

871
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
be communicating together at the same

872
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
time

873
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,679
which was huge uh you know for for which

874
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
was huge for this setting

875
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,120
so what they did is they would feed or

876
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
they would you know the computer

877
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,080
would spread out the ciphertex the

878
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,200
acoustic modem the acoustic modem would

879
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,360
convert it to some

880
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,399
you know some acoustic message and then

881
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,559
they would record that

882
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,399
on a tape recorder and then they would

883
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,520
take this tape recorder

884
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,239
and go to the phone booth okay now in

885
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,840
the phone booth

886
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,360
the state recorder is small so it didn't

887
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,879
look suspicious

888
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,479
um and what they did is that

889
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,360
they would go to a phone booth and they

890
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,880
would call a safe house in london

891
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,559
okay there was a phone number that you

892
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,039
could call and they would call there

893
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,039
and that that safe house or that phone

894
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,039
number just had an answering machine

895
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,720
okay and so then what they did is they

896
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,799
would take the message

897
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
that was recorded from the acoustic from

898
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,639
the acoustic modem

899
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,039
and play it you know at the phone booth

900
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,679
and

901
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,120
that would be sent to the answering

902
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,760
machine which would record it and so

903
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,678
this

904
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,799
answering machine right this is a simple

905
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,559
simple technology

906
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,158
but this answering machine allowed them

907
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
to build an asynchronous system right

908
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,520
because it was recorded and so

909
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,399
the sender and the receiver didn't have

910
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,760
to be online at the same time

911
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,120
um so to retrieve the message then what

912
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,480
the receiver would do is the receiver

913
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,520
would go to the phone booth

914
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,960
um with with a tape recorder they would

915
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,799
uh call in this number in london

916
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,279
listen to the message and record that

917
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,158
message on the tape recorder

918
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
um and then go back to the safehouse

919
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,960
play it

920
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,919
and then the acoustic modem uh you know

921
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,600
would give it

922
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,760
to the computer and the computer's

923
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,279
decryption algorithm would

924
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:30,240
reproduce the message okay um

925
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:34,840
and so this is you know this is

926
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,120
i think an amazing um you know

927
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,559
amazing architecture it's an amazing

928
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,559
design right it was

929
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:45,120
done um you know under like

930
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,399
it was the motivation was was because of

931
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,600
like real life

932
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,799
a real life scenario um and the people

933
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,199
that designed this

934
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,918
used encryption and and answering

935
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,760
machines and

936
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,320
phone booths and computers and this was

937
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,399
all in the mid 80s

938
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,639
which is which is incredible um

939
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,479
now the encryption scheme that they used

940
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
was was you know something that we would

941
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,960
recognize today right so the idea was

942
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
you would take a seat and you would feed

943
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,919
it to a pseudo-random generator and then

944
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,840
you would export that with the message

945
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,279
so they were aware that the one-time pad

946
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,399
was you know

947
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,960
was was perfectly secure um but of

948
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,239
course

949
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,080
and and they i think at some point they

950
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,440
even tried to to you know move

951
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,240
like uh you know huge like briefcases

952
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
with with

953
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,240
keys in them you know but obviously that

954
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,480
was very unpractical so

955
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,760
um they ended up you know getting to the

956
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,519
point where they were

957
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,200
they figured out or they they designed

958
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,360
the custom suit around them generally

959
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,360
and i don't know exactly what this prg

960
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,399
was i i i would love to know more but

961
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
uh but unfortunately i don't

962
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,840
and then the problem was okay well they

963
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,120
had this this surround the generator

964
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
the question then was okay well how do

965
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
we feed it right where do we get the

966
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,200
seeds and so what they did

967
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,719
to generate seeds is they would generate

968
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
seeds from books

969
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,320
um so you know the center and the

970
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,480
receiver would have

971
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,678
the same the same book and they would

972
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
pick out words

973
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,360
from that book and use that as as the

974
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,879
seed

975
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,559
and to make sure that they weren't

976
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
reusing the same seed they were using

977
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,840
visible ink

978
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,760
to mark the words and the sentences on

979
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,039
the book that were used

980
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,600
and there's also mention of error

981
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,799
correction um because this was an issue

982
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,158
that they had to deal with

983
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,200
there's actually some really interesting

984
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
story in that when they were at the

985
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
phone booth they would

986
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,399
put in coins because the phones were

987
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,918
coin operated

988
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,840
and that would make so much noise that

989
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,279
it would add errors into

990
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,279
uh the into the communications and so

991
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,640
they they came up with some error

992
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,600
correcting techniques

993
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
um um but then they also figured out uh

994
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,439
that they could use

995
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
uh phone cards so around that time you

996
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,880
know

997
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,720
there was a certain phone company that

998
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
had that was starting to introduce

999
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
public pay phones where you could use

1000
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,919
phone cards and so they moved they moved

1001
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,000
to that

1002
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,679
so the system um ran

1003
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,320
heavily it was heavily used by the anc

1004
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,840
for a lot of their communications um and

1005
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,639
it ran without detection until the early

1006
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,639
1990s

1007
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
which is you know really a testament to

1008
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,000
how well-designed it was

1009
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,600
and it was even used to communicate with

1010
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,880
nelson mandela while he was in jail

1011
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,439
right so the idea is that people would

1012
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
use

1013
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,200
the system to communicate and eventually

1014
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,399
a message you know through the system

1015
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,399
the message would get

1016
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,639
to mandela's lawyer mandela's lawyer

1017
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,678
would take the message and sneak it into

1018
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,720
jail and give it to him okay

1019
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:34,399
um which is you know

1020
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,960
which is amazing so the designers of

1021
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,239
this system

1022
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,720
in particular tim jenkins um you know

1023
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,960
at the time again mercedes actually

1024
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,360
consulted the crypto literature

1025
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,200
um because he wanted to know a little

1026
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,000
bit more about encryption

1027
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,559
and as he was looking through uh you

1028
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,799
know

1029
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,760
books or you know maybe papers i'm not

1030
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,600
sure

1031
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
um you know he he said the phone he said

1032
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,439
that all i discovered was that

1033
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
cryptology

1034
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
was an arcane science for board

1035
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,080
mathematicians not for underground

1036
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,919
activists

1037
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,000
however i discovered a few tricks and

1038
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,360
used these to develop a system to meet

1039
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,639
our needs

1040
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,679
so this is kind of a you know a harsh

1041
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,250
indictment maybe of you know

1042
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
of the crypto community it's you know

1043
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,960
[Music]

1044
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
is it fair i mean you know this is his

1045
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,599
perspective

1046
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,919
um but honestly i think if an activist

1047
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,119
were to consult you know the crypto

1048
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,759
literature today

1049
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,040
2020 i think they would come up with

1050
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,079
pretty much the same

1051
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,560
you know the same analysis right before

1052
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,679
if we're honest and so the question then

1053
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,040
becomes well

1054
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,639
okay so should activists protesters

1055
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,399
uh marginalize groups should they be

1056
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,320
solving their own crypto problems

1057
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,598
should they be designing their own

1058
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,040
systems

1059
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,320
right like is this what they should be

1060
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,320
doing or is this something that we

1061
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,720
should be doing

1062
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,160
um and i think that's a fair question

1063
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
so the second thing i want to talk about

1064
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,078
or the second example i want to talk

1065
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,800
about

1066
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,480
um is something that we're we're working

1067
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,119
on it's it's working progress at brown

1068
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,320
but it's

1069
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,359
it's uh motivated by data and

1070
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,160
by particularly by databases

1071
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,759
um so databases power everything right

1072
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,598
databases are such an amazing piece of

1073
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
technology that we take it for granted

1074
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,880
right the breakthroughs that the

1075
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,399
database community came up with in the

1076
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,440
70s and the 80s

1077
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,280
are just amazing um and you know we

1078
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,079
wouldn't have twitter and electronic

1079
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
medical records

1080
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,599
and netflix and the new york times you

1081
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
know online

1082
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,640
presence if it wasn't for for all of

1083
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,240
these amazing

1084
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,520
amazing database technologies but

1085
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,799
databases also have kind of a dark past

1086
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,839
right um and a dark side to them

1087
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,760
and so this is is a you know tabulating

1088
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,279
card uh this one dates from

1089
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,800
1927 and you know you can store data on

1090
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,680
this thing right you just kind of punch

1091
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,119
holes or whatever

1092
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
and you can imagine if you have like

1093
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,320
thousands of of these things right this

1094
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,279
is kind of like an example of a proto

1095
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,119
database right a

1096
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,880
database before we had before we had

1097
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,480
computers and what you would do is you

1098
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
would take these these cards and you

1099
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,200
would feed them to a to a

1100
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,560
you know a tabulation machine and the

1101
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,319
tabulation machine would run some kind

1102
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,960
of algorithm on this data on the data

1103
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,800
that was encoded on these cards

1104
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,480
and so um this kind of you know what

1105
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,040
i'll call a proto database

1106
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,000
um you know was was used before

1107
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,200
computers

1108
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,760
and one use was in germany in 1933

1109
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,118
hitler is elected chancellor of germany

1110
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
and the german government conducts a

1111
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,359
census

1112
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,160
and the government uses

1113
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,839
this these tabulation machines from a

1114
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,879
company called diomag i'm not sure if

1115
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,759
i'm pronouncing it correctly it was a

1116
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,320
subsidiary

1117
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,160
of ibm and it uses these tabulation

1118
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,440
machines together with some statistical

1119
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,480
algorithms that i don't know who

1120
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,320
designed

1121
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,960
to identify the jews in germany

1122
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,800
and because of these tabulation machines

1123
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,480
and these these cards

1124
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,280
and these algorithms the estimates

1125
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,839
of jews in germany jumps from 400 000 to

1126
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,079
2 million

1127
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:13,279
okay and it's also known that these

1128
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,839
these you know proto databases were also

1129
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,400
in every or most nazi concentration

1130
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,440
camps

1131
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,920
and were used you know to you know for

1132
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,960
various

1133
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,839
logistical reasons okay

1134
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,079
so this is an example of how a

1135
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,560
technology as simple as a database

1136
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,520
um depending on the social context in

1137
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,880
which it's used

1138
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,400
can have very negative right obviously

1139
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
horrific horrific effects and so another

1140
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,200
example

1141
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,359
of databases is

1142
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,960
calgan this is a database that is

1143
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,000
maintained by the state of california to

1144
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,400
try gang members

1145
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,640
there are 88 000 people in caligan 85 of

1146
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,599
them are black and latino

1147
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,040
and the criteria for inclusion includes

1148
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,119
you know admitting that you're in a gang

1149
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,800
or being you know having some

1150
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,640
association with somebody that's in a

1151
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,359
gang afternoon certain tattoos

1152
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,118
using certain hand signs or dressing

1153
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,319
like a gang member okay

1154
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,880
and as you can imagine there are a lot

1155
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,320
of false positives in this database

1156
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,920
and there's a lot of databases like this

1157
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,480
throughout the country right

1158
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,599
california isn't isn't special in having

1159
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
one

1160
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,720
and there are a lot of really serious

1161
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,160
consequences to being in one of these

1162
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,000
things right so one of them is that you

1163
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,000
know you probably are being you know

1164
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,680
harassed by the police and having

1165
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,960
additional police attention increases

1166
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,319
when you're in one of these things

1167
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,160
you can be the nine bill you can be the

1168
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,480
united housing can be denied employment

1169
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,000
okay so this has a real consequences on

1170
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,839
people

1171
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,079
um there was an audit made of of

1172
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,078
the cal gang database and you know there

1173
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,880
was a lot of errors that were found 42

1174
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,440
entries

1175
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,079
were less than a year old they reviewed

1176
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,320
thoroughly

1177
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,400
100 people that were in this database

1178
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
they found that 13 out of 100

1179
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,119
should have never been included in this

1180
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,760
database that no gang affiliation

1181
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,119
whatsoever

1182
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,000
okay um there was also a law that was

1183
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,040
passed at some point

1184
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,599
that if any juvenile was put into into

1185
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
the calgary

1186
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,640
database then their parents had to be

1187
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,759
notified and they found that there was

1188
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,000
two agencies that

1189
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,760
failed to notify 70 of the 128 juveniles

1190
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,240
that were reviewed okay um

1191
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
there's another database uh so so this

1192
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,078
is the calgary database

1193
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,680
and this calendar database inspired

1194
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,400
another database called ice gangs and

1195
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,118
this

1196
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
gang database is managed by ice were

1197
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,760
both built by the same

1198
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,440
company a company called csra which was

1199
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,040
acquired by general dynamics which is a

1200
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,640
government contractor

1201
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,640
and you can imagine the consequences of

1202
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,040
being in the ice gangs database

1203
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,040
right it increases uh your probability

1204
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
of getting deported right even if you're

1205
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,000
here

1206
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,119
legally um you can be the night daca

1207
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,640
status for example

1208
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,880
okay so they're really really serious

1209
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,400
consequences

1210
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
and so one of the things that we've been

1211
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,240
um they've been working on with

1212
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,000
two of my phd students gossamjad

1213
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,919
and two undergraduate students jessica

1214
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,920
dai and amy pooh

1215
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,000
is the idea of a tab database so the

1216
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,359
idea so the motivation is that you know

1217
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,960
as we've seen and hopefully

1218
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,400
you know i've been able to convince you

1219
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,079
that databases have a huge impact on

1220
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,440
marginalized groups

1221
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,200
um and our idea is that well

1222
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
you know what if you could design a

1223
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,799
database that erases itself

1224
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,200
right even if somebody is actively

1225
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,119
trying to preserve the data in it

1226
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,960
and what if this database only preserved

1227
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,240
records past their expiration date

1228
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,560
if you got authorization from some

1229
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,279
trusted you know party like from some

1230
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,680
judge

1231
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,880
okay um additionally wouldn't it be

1232
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,440
great if you could check

1233
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
if you're in one of these databases

1234
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,240
right if you could

1235
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,920
sort of audit this database in a private

1236
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,680
way and so

1237
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
i'm not going to talk about the protocol

1238
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
and how it works and all these things i

1239
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,040
think that's sort of

1240
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,960
not the most interesting part um but the

1241
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,240
part that i want to highlight is that

1242
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,319
the goal of this paper

1243
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,759
or the goal of this work is to really

1244
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
think about power dynamics right the

1245
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,480
idea is to flip

1246
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,160
is to try to flip the power dynamics

1247
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
right now we have to trust law

1248
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,240
enforcement to erase data

1249
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,839
and you know that's not being done and

1250
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
there's a lot of false positives and

1251
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,078
people's lives are being affected by

1252
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,240
this

1253
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,920
right so instead of trusting law

1254
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,479
enforcement to do this

1255
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,319
why don't we design a system that will

1256
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,599
erase itself right that will erase the

1257
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,160
data so we can flip

1258
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,680
the dynamics right and we will require

1259
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,598
law enforcement to get permission in

1260
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,759
order to keep the data

1261
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,760
and so this is an example of kind of you

1262
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,839
know what i'm

1263
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,960
trying to get at in terms of the kinds

1264
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,279
of of

1265
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,000
of resource agendas that i think you

1266
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,640
know

1267
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,079
could have an impact on marginalized or

1268
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,118
marginalized groups

1269
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,480
um so okay so we have some preliminary

1270
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,440
results it shows you know so it's

1271
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,440
possible to do

1272
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,480
it's it's slow and it's not complete but

1273
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,960
again this is not

1274
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,920
really the you know the point of the

1275
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,079
work the point of the work is to

1276
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,520
highlight this change in in power

1277
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,119
dynamics

1278
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,280
um okay so

1279
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,160
let's sort of take a step back right i

1280
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
gave you two

1281
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,440
examples um one historical which was

1282
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,240
this vula system

1283
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,760
that was designed by by the you know

1284
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,919
activists right by by the

1285
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,800
african national congress um and this

1286
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
other example

1287
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,480
of tab databases which is what we're you

1288
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,759
know work that that is

1289
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,240
happening now um but i also want to give

1290
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
you

1291
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,680
a sense of what i'm not talking about

1292
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,319
okay so

1293
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,279
what i what i'm not talking about is a

1294
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,240
project

1295
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
that has the following form right like

1296
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,959
my blockchain

1297
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,480
is going to serve you know rural

1298
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,400
communities in africa or

1299
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,240
my new cryptographic protocol is going

1300
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,000
to solve long-standing development

1301
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,680
issues and unlock much needed economic

1302
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,640
growth and this is actual quote from an

1303
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,118
actual project

1304
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,920
okay um and so the distinction between

1305
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,480
the two right like what at least what i

1306
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,400
perceive

1307
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,160
as as what i would call crypto for the

1308
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
people and what i would not call crypto

1309
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,319
for the people

1310
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,560
is that if your project

1311
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,160
or your agenda is using marginalized

1312
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,880
groups to motivate your existing

1313
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,000
research

1314
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,480
or product then i think you're doing it

1315
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,839
wrong

1316
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,480
right um ideally i think what we want is

1317
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,799
we want you know new research agendas

1318
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,200
and new technologies that address

1319
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,880
problems that we know are experienced by

1320
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,078
marginalized groups

1321
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,440
and in addition ideally this should be

1322
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,599
done in consultation

1323
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,800
with those groups right with people that

1324
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,520
are affected by this

1325
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,319
as much as possible okay um

1326
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,520
so yeah so i also want to you know

1327
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,279
because i don't know this may be a

1328
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,759
controversial talk to some people

1329
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,599
so i want to you know be very clear

1330
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,640
about what i am not saying

1331
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,560
so i am not suggesting you know

1332
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,560
that cryptographers do useless work

1333
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,759
right this is not what i'm trying to say

1334
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,680
and i'm not trying to suggest that

1335
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,520
photographers don't care about people

1336
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,879
i'm not even suggesting that every

1337
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,560
cryptographer should work on this kind

1338
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000
of problem or that you as

1339
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,759
an individual should work on this kind

1340
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,040
of problem right this is not

1341
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,599
what i'm trying to get at what i am

1342
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,839
saying

1343
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,280
what i am suggesting is that as a

1344
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
community right that the crypto

1345
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,640
community

1346
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,598
has had little impact on marginalized

1347
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,400
people

1348
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,839
right at least this is my perspective

1349
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,800
being in this community for

1350
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,000
something like 15 years um you know and

1351
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,359
being from one of these marginalized

1352
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,079
groups

1353
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,440
um i also feel like the community is

1354
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,720
barely aware of the problems of

1355
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,800
marginalized groups

1356
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,240
right it's just not a subject or topic

1357
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,119
or something that comes up and that

1358
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,759
people discuss

1359
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
or think about and i also think that the

1360
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,760
community suffers from a serious lack of

1361
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,359
diversity which i think is tied to this

1362
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,960
second point right the reason these

1363
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,000
discussions or these ideas or these

1364
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,640
research agendas

1365
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,200
don't come up is because the community

1366
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,240
is not

1367
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,240
particularly diverse

1368
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,079
so if we go back to thinking about the

1369
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,839
impact of cryptography

1370
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,280
right cryptography is critical to

1371
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,520
governments and diplomacy

1372
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,359
war intelligence banking and privacy

1373
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,440
this is clearly true

1374
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,598
um cryptography is in the process of

1375
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,280
impacting finance and data storage and

1376
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,480
advertising analytics and machine

1377
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
learning this is

1378
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,760
obviously true and this is very exciting

1379
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,079
right

1380
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,680
and because of this crypto is going to

1381
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,359
generate a lot of money

1382
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,598
and it's going to generate a lot of

1383
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,720
power right for itself as a community

1384
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,240
let's say right

1385
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,799
which is which is fine um but

1386
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,598
i guess what i'm asking is or what i'm

1387
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,119
wondering about

1388
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,960
is you know can crypto impact people

1389
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,119
in particular again can crypto impact

1390
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,319
marginalized people and that

1391
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,760
i don't know right um i don't feel like

1392
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,000
it's done this in the past

1393
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,680
uh but i hope maybe it'll do it in the

1394
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,520
future

1395
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,440
and so but this is really up to the

1396
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,640
community right it's not up to me

1397
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,520
um i'm just one person and i think this

1398
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,440
is going to take

1399
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
a lot of work and effort if this is

1400
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,200
something that the community wants to do

1401
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,720
right it's going to take new research

1402
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,319
agendas right it's going to take new

1403
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,720
research on problems that are motivated

1404
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,560
by the experience of marginalized groups

1405
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,560
um it's going to take the community

1406
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,000
value potential impact rather than

1407
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,400
technical depth

1408
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,319
right technical depth isn't everything

1409
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,200
um it's going to require new incentives

1410
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,640
and rewards

1411
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,240
it's going to require maybe new

1412
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,598
publication venues and workshops on

1413
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,040
lecture series

1414
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,880
it's going to require new sources of

1415
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,319
funding right i don't think

1416
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,760
big technology companies and the

1417
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,440
department of defense are going to be

1418
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,160
funding this kind of work right it's

1419
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,359
not in their interest so is the nsf

1420
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,440
going to fund this

1421
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,119
maybe i don't know right but it's not

1422
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,119
just up to the nsf

1423
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,800
you know you as an individual researcher

1424
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,800
if you're on an nsf panel

1425
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
are you how are you going to rate a

1426
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,000
project or a grant

1427
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,598
that is focused on the news of

1428
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,960
marginalized groups right and how are

1429
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,079
you going to compare that

1430
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,920
to another project that maybe is focused

1431
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,119
on making the latest advances you know

1432
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,960
on the latest like

1433
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,240
cryptographic primitive that is very

1434
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,000
very popular right now

1435
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,919
right um it's also going to take

1436
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,280
you know like the or

1437
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,680
the community is also going to have to

1438
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,599
make efforts to diversify itself

1439
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,040
right um demographically and

1440
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,440
intellectually

1441
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,640
and um you know this is something that

1442
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,599
is difficult to do

1443
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,640
right and so kind of the last thing i

1444
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,480
want to mention because i'm

1445
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,400
you know running out of running out of

1446
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,599
time um the last thing i want to talk

1447
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,680
about is about

1448
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,920
efforts to diversifying the community

1449
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,720
right um because i think this is

1450
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,319
important

1451
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,759
as i mentioned this is tied into the

1452
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,520
fact that a lot of these research

1453
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,800
problems and these agendas aren't being

1454
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,920
considered

1455
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,160
and so one of the things that that

1456
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,079
that i want to say about diversity is

1457
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,680
that diversity doesn't just happen

1458
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
right like we're not going to get a

1459
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,640
diverse community by just

1460
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,960
kind of waiting um there are structural

1461
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,078
impediments and there's structural

1462
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,400
roadblocks

1463
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,680
right that stop people from accessing

1464
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,760
certain spaces

1465
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,359
and so diversity requires effort it

1466
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,920
requires resources and it requires a

1467
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,839
strategy

1468
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,440
a short-term strategy a midterm strategy

1469
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,558
and a long-term strategy

1470
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,319
and it also requires changes in culture

1471
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
you know diversity isn't going to happen

1472
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,599
in a culture that's closed

1473
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,919
and that's not particularly welcoming

1474
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,839
right a community has to be open

1475
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,359
and welcoming if you want it to

1476
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,520
diversify itself

1477
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,960
so you know as an example like a lot of

1478
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,400
the things that we do

1479
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,000
right in our communities and this is not

1480
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,960
just crypto it's in computer science in

1481
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,119
general

1482
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,960
definitely in academia right a lot of

1483
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,359
our events are invitation only

1484
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,160
right like you know i've been to i don't

1485
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,839
know how many

1486
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,359
events where it was like i just happened

1487
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,279
to get this email from somebody and it's

1488
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,040
like okay well i guess i'll go

1489
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,040
but is this really welcoming is this

1490
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,920
really open to a lot of smart people

1491
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,319
around the world

1492
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,200
right that are doing amazing work and

1493
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,800
they'll

1494
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,960
they don't get the invitation they don't

1495
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,000
get that email right

1496
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,440
um we also need to create more diverse

1497
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
recruiting pipelines

1498
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,480
right like everybody doesn't have to

1499
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,920
come from the same school everybody

1500
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,800
doesn't have to come from the same

1501
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
places

1502
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
right we but that requires effort we

1503
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,400
need to go recruit people from different

1504
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,160
parts

1505
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,520
different parts of the world and also

1506
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,879
from from different you know from

1507
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,040
different groups

1508
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,920
um and we also need to value more

1509
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,480
diverse research

1510
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,839
research agendas right we don't we

1511
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,359
shouldn't all be working on the same

1512
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,160
things right it's okay

1513
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,520
like you know to value problems and

1514
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,759
research agendas

1515
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,200
you know that that care about you know

1516
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,000
people right maybe

1517
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,879
you know crypto and usability right

1518
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,119
maybe crypto

1519
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,480
and marginalized groups maybe crypto and

1520
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,960
all of these things right these

1521
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,960
these research agendas have to be valid

1522
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,240
if you want to have a more diverse

1523
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,000
uh more diverse field um

1524
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,479
so yeah so i think that's pretty much

1525
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:44,000
all i wanted to say um

1526
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,839
and uh yeah so take any any questions

1527
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,359
awesome uh thank you so much sonny for

1528
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,200
that uh

1529
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:54,799
super thought uh provoking talk um

1530
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,598
i guess we could uh give a very brief uh

1531
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,280
unmuted uh clap it if we want uh for

1532
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,770
everyone

1533
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,400
yeah go

1534
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:05,599
[Applause]

1535
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,599
please remember to mute yourself

1536
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,680
one day we'll have the technology to do

1537
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,119
clapping properly

1538
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,118
okay there's there's actually quite a

1539
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,559
number of uh questions

1540
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,800
uh already um on uh zulu um and i guess

1541
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,920
i'll just go ahead and start

1542
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,599
um with uh one of them and i

1543
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,960
i might editorialize the question a

1544
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,079
little bit from uh

1545
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,800
martin albrecht on zulip he's asking

1546
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,640
what uh academic photographers you know

1547
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,720
who want to design for actors protesters

1548
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,200
you know what do they need to establish

1549
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,078
uh the needs of these communities and i

1550
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,879
think this really speaks

1551
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,240
to a challenge for cryptographers which

1552
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,720
is there's this barrier of entry to

1553
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,680
doing

1554
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,359
the type of research you're advocating

1555
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,440
because you need to be able to talk to

1556
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,960
and and and understand the needs of the

1557
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,280
marginalized communities

1558
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,160
so can you uh speak to that yeah so i

1559
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
think that's

1560
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,759
you know that's a really good question

1561
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,040
and it's an important question because

1562
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,720
you know um technology in general crypto

1563
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,040
in particular crypto expertise all these

1564
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,399
things aren't always going to be the

1565
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
solution sometimes you can make things

1566
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,640
worse

1567
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,480
right so it's really really important

1568
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,759
and i think this is what i like about

1569
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,720
this question is that this is

1570
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,520
sort of has this humility to it right um

1571
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,439
is that

1572
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,040
you know you really have to be engaged

1573
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,760
with the people that

1574
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,240
you're supposedly you know helping you

1575
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,359
have to

1576
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,720
talk with them you have to meet with

1577
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,680
them and you have to hear from them and

1578
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,720
you really have to

1579
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,680
to listen to them um and so i don't

1580
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,480
think there's a

1581
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,440
replacement to just like interaction

1582
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,920
right like

1583
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,960
if you want to work on you know if if

1584
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,040
you have an idea

1585
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,319
for let's say something that could

1586
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,680
potentially help

1587
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,599
uh you know like black kids that are

1588
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,960
harassed by the police right or police

1589
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,680
brutality but

1590
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,520
you don't know any black people then you

1591
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,680
know whatever you come up with

1592
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,599
may not be the right answer right like

1593
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,640
the reality is you just have to interact

1594
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,000
and so you can't

1595
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,319
be you know so like in in research

1596
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,680
and especially when we're doing the more

1597
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,960
the more abstract parts of our work

1598
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,160
right the more theoretical parts of our

1599
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,359
work right we're just in our offices on

1600
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,960
a whiteboard

1601
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,359
and we have these beautiful abstractions

1602
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,800
and and we do our work but this isn't

1603
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,480
the kind of work that lends itself to

1604
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,960
that right you really have to put in the

1605
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,319
time and the effort uh to talk to people

1606
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,559
and to get to know them and to hear

1607
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,279
about what they're doing and so you know

1608
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,480
that's yeah unfortunately it just

1609
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,400
requires that

1610
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,160
that work and so if you have a project

1611
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,839
idea that you think will

1612
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,520
help a particular community a particular

1613
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,440
group then you know you need to look up

1614
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,040
the different organizations that work in

1615
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,240
the space and maybe reach out to them

1616
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,440
and have meetings with them

1617
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,359
and really really listen to what they

1618
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,680
have to say

1619
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,119
yeah fantastic and so maybe that begs as

1620
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,440
a as a meta

1621
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,800
issue that like one contribution here is

1622
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,400
actually just gathering some of that

1623
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,839
information about what type of resources

1624
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,599
are out there about

1625
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,440
marginalized communities and who who's

1626
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,720
actually um

1627
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,720
you know providing some framework for

1628
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,399
actually going about that something that

1629
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,598
the community could consider uh

1630
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,119
doing even before thinking about

1631
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,440
individual projects yeah fantastic

1632
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,160
another question uh from zulu uh by

1633
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,480
andrew

1634
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,040
uh clark is that the purposes of the icr

1635
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,800
include a statement to quote serve the

1636
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,079
public welfare end quote

1637
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,640
it does that through meetings like

1638
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,240
crypto if you could add a guideline to

1639
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,598
the program committees to serve

1640
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,839
the wider public welfare do you have an

1641
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,839
idea what it might be

1642
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,160
um that's an interesting question so

1643
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,759
i'm you know it's something that i think

1644
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,799
requires more thought than just

1645
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:44,160
you know something to answer on

1646
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,280
on the spot but you know i think like in

1647
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,598
general

1648
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,800
you know the the icr is a great

1649
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,880
organization right it's

1650
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:56,000
it's it's um it does a lot of

1651
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,079
great things for the community but i

1652
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,680
think this is kind of the key is that it

1653
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,880
does it for the community

1654
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,440
right i don't know sort of how much we

1655
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,440
do

1656
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,440
as an organization and as a community

1657
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,200
for other people

1658
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,119
and so some may say well okay that's not

1659
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,960
necessarily the role of the icr i

1660
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,640
i'm not sure right like that's an

1661
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,839
argument that that we can have and we

1662
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,279
can figure out

1663
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,759
um but but maybe

1664
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,160
like you know the icr given its

1665
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,280
resources and its reach um

1666
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:30,480
and its credibility you know could

1667
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,280
be you know doing more to

1668
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,200
to to promote certain certain causes or

1669
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,480
to gather resources or to to help

1670
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,078
organize workshops

1671
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,839
to bring people together from different

1672
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,240
areas um

1673
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,960
you know that's something that the icr

1674
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,040
could do

1675
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,000
right but i think like going back to the

1676
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,240
first question

1677
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,119
about how how to do this kind of work

1678
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,879
this kind of work

1679
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,680
isn't independent so it's not something

1680
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,240
that the icr can do itself right what i

1681
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,040
what i see as something uh that we need

1682
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,839
to do is

1683
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,839
is you know it's something that needs

1684
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,160
people who have expertise in usability

1685
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,359
needs people who have expertise in in

1686
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,319
the social sciences

1687
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,759
right in in the humanities it's not it's

1688
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,839
not something that just cryptographers

1689
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,000
can just go on and solve on their own

1690
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,279
and so these projects need kind of a

1691
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,359
broader

1692
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,119
base and a broader skill set and maybe

1693
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,598
the icr could help facilitate those

1694
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,000
kinds of discussions

1695
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,079
yeah uh fantastic answer there's a

1696
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,720
question from carl ellison

1697
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,319
uh which was essentially the same type

1698
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,680
of question you know can

1699
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,319
who's can provide these types of

1700
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,759
channels uh to reach out to marginalized

1701
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,440
communities to understand

1702
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,119
uh these types of issues and it sounds

1703
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,240
like you know you've already addressed

1704
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,760
that question

1705
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,520
uh via saying like you know we need to

1706
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,480
set up frameworks and increase diversity

1707
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,640
etc

1708
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,599
so uh with apologies to carl i'm gonna

1709
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,879
skip that

1710
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,040
uh josh uh benilo asked um

1711
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,960
uh well first said great talk uh and

1712
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,400
then he said uh i'd like to think that

1713
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,400
applying

1714
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,520
uh applying crypto to improve election

1715
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,680
integrity

1716
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,799
wherein voters can check for themselves

1717
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,200
that their voters

1718
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,040
votes are accurately counted would count

1719
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,720
as crypto for the people

1720
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,558
would you agree or do i just have an

1721
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,160
inflated view of the importance of this

1722
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,520
work

1723
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:21,440
um yeah that's a great question so

1724
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,880
yeah i think so

1725
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,119
you know i think it does um

1726
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,599
and i think part of that is is not just

1727
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,240
because you know obviously voting is is

1728
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,640
you know like hugely important for all

1729
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,640
people

1730
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,839
right um for for obvious reasons but

1731
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,839
in particular given um you know

1732
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,119
given the efforts of voter suppression

1733
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,000
that are targeted

1734
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,520
usually you know at marginalized groups

1735
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,079
at people of color

1736
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,200
um you know having robust and and you

1737
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,319
know

1738
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,040
uh voting systems that that that are you

1739
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:58,799
know

1740
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:02,558
uh verifiable and and

1741
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:05,119
is important um so you know i think

1742
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,640
i think there's a there's a reasonable

1743
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,480
there's a reasonable point there

1744
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,520
um you know um

1745
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,599
i think just having crypto

1746
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,960
based you know like verifiable and all

1747
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,880
this beautiful cryptography

1748
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,000
for these protocols is not enough

1749
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,079
because really like

1750
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,359
we can have this but if the you know

1751
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,119
without the voting rights act then like

1752
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,799
you know what good is it really going to

1753
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,000
do for marginalized groups right

1754
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,359
like so so i think that's true that's

1755
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,720
true in some sense

1756
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,078
but here crypto alone and voting

1757
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,078
protocols alone

1758
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,520
i don't think is enough at least from my

1759
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,640
perspective to say that it's

1760
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,640
cryptic for the people at least in the

1761
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,040
way that i think of it right it would be

1762
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,000
that

1763
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,640
plus the right uh the right political

1764
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,160
framework

1765
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,960
and the right policy framework around it

1766
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,399
yeah it makes uh perfect sense so uh

1767
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,000
we'll take a few more uh

1768
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,760
questions that's okay and then and then

1769
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,799
we'll go to the break

1770
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,480
so um uh or dunkelman uh asks

1771
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:09,280
um how how do you compare the experience

1772
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,040
of the crypto community with respect to

1773
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,680
these issues versus the way the

1774
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,160
pets community uh addresses these types

1775
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,160
of issues

1776
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,400
yeah great question so you know i

1777
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:26,160
um it's hard for me because i i

1778
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,440
i don't want to like speak for the pets

1779
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,720
community it's like you know i've been

1780
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,160
to pets a few times and i

1781
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,160
and i read the proceedings but it's you

1782
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,720
know i i don't want to sit here as an

1783
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,359
expert

1784
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,200
of like pets and crypto and all these

1785
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,200
things so i'm a bit hesitant to

1786
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,399
you know to give an analysis like this i

1787
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,480
think it's clear that

1788
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,480
or you know at least i i believe that

1789
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,680
the pets community is definitely

1790
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,720
i think more socially engaged than uh

1791
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,160
the crypto community i think this is

1792
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,279
something that phil ragaway has talked

1793
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,558
about right in his

1794
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,559
in his essay um

1795
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,078
and and i don't even think that's a

1796
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,279
controversial statement personally i

1797
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,799
think it's really really obvious the

1798
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,520
press community is very very engaged on

1799
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,640
privacy

1800
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,520
on on many issues

1801
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,400
i think you know my view again this is

1802
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,200
perspective

1803
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,960
right this is perspective this is from

1804
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,240
my experiences in life

1805
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,640
my view of the press community is that

1806
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,359
the focus is is a lot on

1807
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,920
on privacy and on personal freedoms so

1808
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,680
it's

1809
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,440
you know kind of closer to this

1810
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,799
libertarian you know

1811
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,440
point of view which is you know which is

1812
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,160
fine

1813
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,119
but it's not necessarily exactly what

1814
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,640
i'm talking about

1815
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,799
right what i'm talking about is slightly

1816
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,440
different has

1817
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,000
it's slightly different concerns right

1818
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,359
and

1819
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,640
um of course there's an intersection

1820
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,160
there so i don't mean to suggest that

1821
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,200
these are completely separate things

1822
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,839
right like

1823
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,520
uh you know marginalized people also

1824
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,240
care about privacy and also care about

1825
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,839
you know like

1826
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,680
freedom of expression all these things

1827
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,480
but as i was but the point i was trying

1828
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,680
to make

1829
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,559
is that there are a whole host and

1830
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,399
of concerns that i don't think you know

1831
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,720
that neither the crypto community or you

1832
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,880
know

1833
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,919
the icr community nor the pets community

1834
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,359
addresses

1835
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,559
right a whole bunch of adversarial

1836
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,520
models and a whole bunch of problems

1837
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,960
that are just

1838
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,400
not considered yeah uh yeah it makes

1839
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,920
sense i mean you can almost view and

1840
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,240
this might be an abuse of terminology

1841
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,160
but

1842
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,759
you know uh it's almost intersectional

1843
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,720
in terms of threat models right every

1844
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,920
individual person

1845
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,759
including people from marginalized

1846
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,440
groups have both

1847
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,920
you know general privacy concerns but

1848
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,480
also uh specific threat models that are

1849
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,200
related

1850
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,799
specifically to their marginalized uh

1851
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,558
marginalized status and

1852
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:34,480
and and so you need to consider all

1853
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,480
these things maybe the pets is doing

1854
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,680
some of that more uh directly than

1855
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,720
others

1856
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:44,319
uh great so uh another question

1857
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,879
uh from kevin mccurley uh so another

1858
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,759
example

1859
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,680
of abusing people is the headlong rush

1860
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,599
toward two-factor authentication

1861
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,279
as it turns out new now companies

1862
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,799
demanding to know potentially sensitive

1863
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,720
information such as email addresses

1864
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,319
phone numbers about metrics

1865
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,399
uh the reason is because of you know

1866
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,040
people are awful at managing their

1867
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,799
secrets

1868
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,520
and and some people are more concerned

1869
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:07,920
about privacy than others

1870
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,599
uh and he asked you know pretty broad

1871
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,799
question which is how can we design

1872
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,480
cryptographic protocols that are more

1873
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,680
respectful to different needs and values

1874
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,440
of users i think

1875
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,759
you know maybe couching in the context

1876
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,359
of this type of issue with

1877
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,599
multi-factor authentication yeah i mean

1878
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:27,759
i think um you know another

1879
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,880
great question and i think the answer

1880
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,000
personally i think

1881
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:35,760
um one of the things that has been

1882
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,119
really under studied and underexplored

1883
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,720
especially from the crypto community is

1884
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,799
usability

1885
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,399
and i think that that's a really really

1886
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,640
important component

1887
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,000
um you know to be able to create

1888
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,078
technology

1889
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,040
um you know for people in general but in

1890
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,440
particular for

1891
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,960
for uh marginalized groups right because

1892
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,319
their their needs

1893
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,559
are going to be different from the

1894
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,920
mainstream and so if we're designing

1895
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,599
protocols and we're designing systems

1896
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,559
and architectures and

1897
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:05,039
all of these things um without a good

1898
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,359
understanding of what people's needs are

1899
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,559
it's particular certain groups needs are

1900
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:12,000
then you know we're not gonna

1901
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,760
we're not gonna help them so i think

1902
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,280
um you know when we're architecting

1903
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,400
these systems we really have to take

1904
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,400
usability

1905
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,640
really really seriously and we have to

1906
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,119
learn how to figure out

1907
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,480
what people need and we have to really

1908
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,640
be broad

1909
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,680
in um you know in the different groups

1910
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,319
that we're studying

1911
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,480
right different and actually so you have

1912
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,720
a paper right that i think

1913
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,920
focuses you know on one particular but i

1914
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,359
have a particular problem of intimate

1915
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,160
partner violence for example right and

1916
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,319
there's

1917
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,279
there's a focus there on a particular

1918
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,400
threat model

1919
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,960
that is you know fairly unique to that

1920
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,119
you know to that community and but that

1921
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,000
requires really a lot of legwork and a

1922
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,799
lot of effort

1923
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,319
to go and interact with our community

1924
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:57,759
learn what their needs are

1925
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:59,440
and you know using uh the methodologies

1926
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,280
you know and the research from from

1927
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,680
usability

1928
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,480
in order to figure that out so i think

1929
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,038
you know

1930
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,319
cryptographers should should you know

1931
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,200
collaborate with people from different

1932
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,279
communities

1933
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,558
learn these techniques and these tools

1934
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,280
themselves and and

1935
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,720
do that work yeah definitely and and

1936
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,119
that work that you mentioned thanks for

1937
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,839
plugging my work

1938
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,720
was only possible via a really great

1939
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,038
collaboration with

1940
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,000
someone from the hti community so i

1941
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,680
think you know we're over

1942
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,760
uh quite a few minutes now um there's

1943
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,240
like a lot more questions on zulip and

1944
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,720
zoom

1945
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,919
um but i think we'll we'll take it to

1946
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,279
that and maybe if you're

1947
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,960
available to answer some of those

1948
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,000
questions in the chat

1949
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,640
um we can that would be wonderful

1950
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,359
uh also i think uh just to fair say

1951
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,720
there's like

1952
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:48,319
a hundred congratulatory uh uh

1953
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,839
messages saying it was a fantastic talk

1954
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,839
and really really important

1955
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,119
uh talk for the community so thank you

1956
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,599
again for uh

1957
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,960
contributing this great talk and i'll

1958
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,200
turn it over to

1959
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,000
kay uh who i think has announcements

1960
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,078
about the

1961
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,240
social event after this thanks again

1962
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,799
honey all right thank you

1963
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,839
yes thank you sonny for the wonderful

1964
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,960
talk

1965
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:13,279
thank you and um so what we're planning

1966
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,480
on doing for the social hour

1967
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,480
is uh
