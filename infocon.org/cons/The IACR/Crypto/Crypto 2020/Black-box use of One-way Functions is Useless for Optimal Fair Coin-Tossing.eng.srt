00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,520
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,319
my name is min yun today i will be

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,959
talking about

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,679
black box use of one-way functions is

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
useless

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,920
for optimal fair coin tossing this is a

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,359
drawing work with my advisor

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,840
hamadamaji

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
so in this work we will be focusing on a

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,359
two-party fair quantizing protocol

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
so this is an input less particle where

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,599
alice and bob

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,720
exchange are messages at an at the end

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,360
of the protocol

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
both parties will agree on an output

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
which is either zero

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,680
or one the fairness

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,000
requires that even if one party aborts

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
during the execution of the protocol the

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,039
other party should still

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,160
output a bid consequently

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,559
every party will maintain a defense coin

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,160
which will be their output if the other

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,039
party aborts

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,519
insecurity of this particle is defined

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
as

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
how much an adversary can alter the

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,798
expected

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
output of the other party

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
so let me first tell you about our

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
contribution

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
by positioning it among prior works

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
firstly in the information theoretic

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,119
setting we know that

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
any protocol for any protocol its

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
insecurity is at least

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,360
a constant however

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,600
if you are willing to assume the

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
existence of one-way functions

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
by a sequence by a sequence of work in

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
the 1980s

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,320
we now have an explicit particle that

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,919
achieves one over square root of our

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,240
insecurity

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,600
recall that r is the number of message

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
exchanged in the protocol

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
if you are willing to assume a stronger

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,119
assumption that oblivious transfer

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,399
exists

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,000
we have an explicit account we also have

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,520
an explicit protocol

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,079
that achieves one over r in security

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
so note that one over r is smaller than

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,878
one over square root of

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,319
r and cliff shows that

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,799
one of our insecurity is unavoidable

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,679
by showing that any our message protocol

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
is at least

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,840
one of our insecure

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
so given this result it is very natural

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
to ask that

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,720
can we construct optimal foreign optimal

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,480
coin tossing fair coin tossing protocols

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
based on one-way functions alone

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
in this work we partially answer this

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
question

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
by showing that any black box

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
construction

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,040
of optimal fair coin tossing protocol

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,160
from one function is at least the one

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,440
over square root of r

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,560
insecure that is one

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,200
function cannot help to achieve oil

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
function

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,799
not only cannot help to achieve one over

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
r in security

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,040
it also cannot help achieve any

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
insecurity lower than one over square

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
root of r

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
for example it i cannot achieve one over

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
r to this three

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
fourths in security so after three

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
decades

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,840
we have now shown that the protocols

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
from the 1980s

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,120
are actually achieving achieves the

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,440
optimal insecurity

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,959
we prove this result by extending the

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,480
potential based argument

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,799
introduced by recent works

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,159
i want to stress that the hardness of

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,200
computational results

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,159
for fair coin tossing protocols extend

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
naturally

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,040
to all multi-party randomized

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,599
functionalities

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,840
as long as the honest players are not in

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,560
the majority

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
so now let me formulate this problem in

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,879
more details

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
we consider a fair coin tossing protocol

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,480
where parties exchange a total of

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
our messages and in this talk we will

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,119
not be restricted to

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
protocols whose output is uniform so we

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
will use

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
x to denote the expected output of the

108
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,238
protocol

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,518
and we refer to such verticals as bias

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,918
x protocol as i said

111
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,440
alice will maintains a defense coin

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,639
which will be her output

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
if bob awards note that she might

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,000
constantly update her defense

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,720
whenever she prepares a new message

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,199
and similarly bob will set up his

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
defense

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,120
and also we will make one simplification

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
that we shall only consider fair stock

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
adversaries

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
so that is the adversary follows the

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,159
protocol honestly

123
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,639
but made aboard prematurely

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
this this simplification can be

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,880
justified by the following two reasons

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,720
firstly this week adversary is actually

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,919
already powerful enough

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,759
to do the most devastating attack

129
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,000
secondly by using private key

130
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,840
cryptocryptography

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,840
primitives we can ensure honest behavior

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,198
so cleaves show that for any r

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,759
message fair calling tossing protocols

134
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,039
there exists a computationally efficient

135
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,360
fair stop adversary that outed expected

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,000
output by 1 by r

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
hence every r message protocol is at

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
least one of our

139
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,479
insecure no matter what computational

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,199
assumption you assume

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,479
therefore we call an r message coin

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,280
tossing protocol

143
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400
an optimal fair coin tossing protocol if

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,039
it is one over r

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
insecure

146
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
now let's look at what are the known

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,719
constructions that we have

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
first if you assume the existence of

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
one-way functions

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
we have this vertical called majority

151
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,599
protocol

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,599
in this protocol alice will sample

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,039
private randomness ai

154
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,080
bob will assemble private and in this bi

155
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,759
in the first round alice commits all her

156
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,800
private bit a1 a2 up to ar to bob

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,560
and then alternatively bob and

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,280
alice will review one bit at a time

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
at the end of the protocol the output is

160
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
the majority

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,520
of a1 xor b1 a2 x1 b2

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,880
and so on so it is known that this

163
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,198
majority protocol

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,600
is 1 over square root of r insecure

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
on the other hand if you are willing to

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,240
assume the existence of

167
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,039
oblivious transfer in a beautiful work

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
moron now and surgif constructed the

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,560
optimal varicoin tossing protocol

170
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,639
that is the m s vertical is one double r

171
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,680
insecure so to summarize

172
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,720
on one hand you have this m s m

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,599
s particle which assumes that oblivious

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
transfer

175
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
exists and achieves the optimal

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
insecurity

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
on the other hand you have them on

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,800
majority protocol

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,199
which have a higher insecurity but

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
assumes a weaker assumption that one

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,000
function exists

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
so in theoretical cryptography a guiding

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
principle

184
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,080
is to build primitives using the minimum

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
or the weakest

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,599
weakness weakest hardness of

187
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,800
computational assumptions

188
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,360
and if such constructions do not exist

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,599
we want to understand what are inherent

190
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
hurdles

191
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,599
so the question we are asking here is

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
that can we construct optimal fair coin

193
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,800
tossing protocol

194
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,719
from one-way function or can we prove

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,199
that it is inherently impossible

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
unfortunately one cannot prove the

197
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,599
negative result

198
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,560
unconditionally one of the prominent way

199
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,960
of studying such

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
questions is through the lens of black

201
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,560
box construction

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,520
introduced by impact diazo in rudish

203
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,039
on a high level a construction is a

204
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
fully black walks

205
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,479
if the construction and the security

206
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,359
reduction

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
treat the primitive and the adversary in

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,879
a black box manner

209
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
that is they only care about the input

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
and output behavior

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,319
of the primitive and the adversary

212
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,519
in light of this impact liado proposed

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,080
her his well-known five words

214
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,039
in a mini-crypt word we have all the

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
primitives

216
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,600
that can be blackbox constructed from

217
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,000
oneway function

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,800
in the cryptomania world we have

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,880
primitives like key agreement protocol

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
public key encryption and oblivious

221
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,800
transfer

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,319
or cannot all of them cannot be black

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
box constructed from one

224
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
function so actually many of the

225
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
primitives

226
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,239
inside the minicrypt were not known to

227
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,440
be

228
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,920
constructed were not known to be able to

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,080
black box constructed from one function

230
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,319
for very long time

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
so for the case of optimal fair and coin

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
tossing protocol

233
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,079
is it still the case that there is a

234
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,440
mysterious construction that we have not

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,080
find out yet or is there a reason

236
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,480
why black box construction does not

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,360
exist

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,959
so whether optimal fair coin tossing

239
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,920
belongs to minicrypt

240
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,439
or cryptomania remains to be one of the

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,160
major open problems

242
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
in this field

243
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,279
so in this work we resolve this problem

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,640
in the negative

245
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,680
as we prove that for every black box

246
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,439
construction

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,319
of an r message bias x fair coin tossing

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
protocol

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,079
from one function is at least x

250
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,839
times one y minus x over square root of

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
r insecure

252
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
so the implication of this theorem is

253
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
that first

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
the black box use of one function cannot

255
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,239
yield

256
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,040
optimal fair coin tossing protocols

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
secondly the majority protocol is

258
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
actually

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,000
qualitatively the most secure protocol

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,239
that one can build

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,240
using one function in blackbox manner

262
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
so following the paradigm proposed by

263
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
impact liaison rudis

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
we consider the coin tossing protocol in

265
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,320
the random oracle model

266
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,480
so in this model alice and bob besides

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
just talking to each other they also

268
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,440
have black box access

269
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:51,120
to a random oracle which is just a

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,760
function that takes a number bit input

271
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,160
number bit string as input and output a

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,839
num

273
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,760
number big string where namda is the

274
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
security parameter

275
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,839
so in this word alice and bob are

276
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,199
computationally unbounded

277
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,240
in an honest execution alice and bob ask

278
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,959
polynomially many queries an

279
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,640
adversary however may ask additional

280
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
queries to the random oracle

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
intuitively this models the usefulness

282
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
of blackbox

283
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,000
access to an idealized one-way function

284
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,240
because random oracle is hard to invert

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
even given unbounded computational

286
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
ability

287
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,880
so our objective is to prove that

288
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,359
there exists a fair stop strategy that

289
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,160
asks

290
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
polynomially many additional queries and

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
altered

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,000
expected output by one over square root

293
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
of r

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
let me tell you what a parallel works in

295
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,479
this setting

296
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,399
in a work by dahmen sword lindau

297
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
mohammedian mocking

298
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,040
they show that if the message complexity

299
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,599
is if the

300
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,279
if the message complexity is small then

301
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,240
a failed stock adversary

302
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,040
can alter the expected output by 1 over

303
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
square root of r

304
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,480
in another work dahmen sold mohammed in

305
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
marking prove that

306
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
if the protocol satisfy a special

307
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
property that they call function

308
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,560
oblivious

309
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
then a fair stock anniversary can alter

310
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,040
the expected output

311
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,839
by strictly more than one over r

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,199
so intuitively function oblivious

313
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
requires that

314
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,399
the output of the protocol depends

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
solely on the private randomness of each

316
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
party

317
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,040
but is independent of the instantiation

318
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,200
of the random oracle

319
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,959
so all the known particles for example

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,480
like the majority protocol

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,479
are function oblivious

322
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
in comparison to this to work our

323
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,439
results resolve this problem

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
in the full generality we impose no

325
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
restriction

326
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,800
on the message complexity or the type of

327
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,000
particles

328
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,319
and our attackers ask only polynomially

329
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
many additional queries

330
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,320
the insecurity it achieves actually

331
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,319
matches the positive result

332
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
and our results works for bias x

333
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,399
verticals

334
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,519
where this x can be an arbitrary number

335
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,240
in particular

336
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,240
x may depend on the security parameter

337
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,120
in another relevant work hetner

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,440
macrayanas and omri prove that there

339
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,480
exists a universal constant c

340
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,880
such that for any constant r the

341
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
existence of our message ferry coin

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,480
tossing protocol

343
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
with insecurity less than c over square

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
root of r

345
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
implies the existence of key element

346
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,479
protocols

347
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
this work is incomparable to our work as

348
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
it proves

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:18,479
a stronger consequence but for restrict

350
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,479
but for restricted class of particles

351
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,240
so now let me tell you a bit about our

352
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,440
technical proof

353
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,760
so recall that we have an r message bias

354
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
x

355
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
fair coin tossing protocol in the random

356
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,160
oracle model

357
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,199
our objective is to find a fair stop

358
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
adversary

359
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,240
that asks polynomially many additional

360
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
queries

361
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
and alter the expected output by 1 by

362
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,160
squared of r

363
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,880
the first issue in a random oracle model

364
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
is that

365
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,680
condition on the public transcript alice

366
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,040
and bob's private view

367
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,199
are correlated due to the common

368
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
private queries they ask to the random

369
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,279
oracle

370
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,639
so our first step is to make alice and

371
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,279
bob's private view

372
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,279
independent

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
this can be done by a tool called heavy

374
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,760
aquarium

375
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,880
to have a courier is introduced by brock

376
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
and mohammadi

377
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
and is the standard techniques for

378
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
removing correlations

379
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,800
between alice and bob's private view in

380
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,399
the random oracle model

381
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
the heavy courier has the following

382
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,199
properties first

383
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,480
it's a public algorithm meaning that it

384
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,439
can be performed by either alice or ball

385
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
it takes the partial transcript as input

386
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,839
and

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,000
outputs a number of query and answer

388
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,480
pairs heavy courier guarantees that

389
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
condition on a partial transcript and

390
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
the heavy couriers message

391
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
alice and bob's private view are close

392
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,719
to being

393
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,800
independent and i have a courier asked

394
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,720
polynomially many additional queries

395
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,639
so we shall use the heavy courier in the

396
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,440
following way

397
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,839
immediately after every protocol message

398
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,959
we will invoke heavy courier

399
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,079
and attach its message to the protocols

400
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,638
message

401
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,239
so for example when alice prepare her

402
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,160
first message

403
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
she will after she prepare her first

404
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,040
message she will invoke the heavy

405
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,359
courier

406
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,319
and attach that message to her first

407
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
message

408
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,759
now this become the first message in

409
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,000
augmented protocol

410
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:36,000
so note that this does not change the

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,360
message complexity of the protocol

412
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,079
so in augmented protocol for any partial

413
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
transcript

414
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
v we shall define the following

415
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,120
quantities

416
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,880
first let pv denote the probability that

417
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,320
v at the partial transcript v happens

418
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,680
secondly we use xv to stand for the

419
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,040
expected output

420
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,079
condition on this partial transcript v

421
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,559
lastly we use av and vv

422
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,918
to denote the expectation of alice and

423
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,678
bob's defense coin

424
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,000
conditioned on this partial transcript

425
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
so given these definitions we're

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
interested in finding a stocking time

427
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,678
tau

428
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,079
and the following score so a stopping

429
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,679
time

430
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,319
is just a prefix freeze collection of

431
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,799
partial transcript

432
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,120
so let's take a closer look at our score

433
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,639
function

434
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,600
so the term av minus xv

435
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,120
is the change in alice's alice's

436
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,360
expected output

437
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,719
if bob aborts at v so this is because

438
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,678
if bob does not abort at v in an

439
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
honest execution the output of the

440
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,799
protocol

441
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:56,720
will have expectation xv by definition

442
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,879
however if bob does a board at node v

443
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
the output of the protocol will be

444
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,559
alice's defense

445
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,760
which has an expectation av

446
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,080
so bob by aborting at node v

447
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
it results in a change in alice's

448
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,960
expected output

449
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,520
the difference between av and xv

450
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,480
analogously if l is aborts at node v

451
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
it results in a change involves expected

452
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,679
output

453
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,879
the difference between bob's defense and

454
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,080
the expected output

455
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,640
so overall when this node v is drawn

456
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,120
according to this stopping time this

457
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
score

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,879
reflects the change in the expected

459
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,879
output when parties

460
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,400
are bored at this stopping time

461
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,120
now we shall prove that the the maximum

462
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
score

463
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,000
yielded by the maximum stocking time is

464
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
large

465
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,160
so follow the reason following the

466
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
recent work

467
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,440
we shall use an inductive approach to

468
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
prove that

469
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,720
this maximum score is higher than z

470
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
times

471
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,240
x times 1 minus x over square root of r

472
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,440
where c is a universal constant

473
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,679
so let's use this figure as an example

474
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,720
so let's suppose phi is the beginning of

475
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,280
the protocol

476
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,799
where the first message has k

477
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,678
possibilities

478
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
so the first message can either be 1 2

479
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,080
or

480
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,960
k now to pick our stopping time

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,960
we need to make an independent decision

482
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,720
for every node

483
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,360
for example at node 1 we need to decide

484
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,039
whether we pick node 1 as our starting

485
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,799
stopping time

486
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:48,480
or we defer attack to the remaining

487
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,480
r minus 1 sub protocol

488
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,520
and we need to make the same decision

489
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,720
for node 2

490
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,840
l3 and so on so

491
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,960
by the definition of our score function

492
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,080
if we pick node 1 as our stopping time

493
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,600
this yields a score of a1 minus x1

494
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,280
plus b1 minus x1 on the other hand

495
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,480
if we defer the attack to this remaining

496
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,918
sub sub-vertical by our inductive

497
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
hypothesis

498
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
this is guaranteed to be higher than c

499
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
times

500
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
x one times one minus x one over square

501
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
root of

502
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,960
r minus one recall that x one

503
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,159
is the expected output of this sub

504
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,120
protocol so the highest

505
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
score will pick decide on whether to

506
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,120
pick node 1

507
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,799
as stopping time or pick tau 1 as the

508
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,239
stopping time based on which

509
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,039
quantity is larger so the maximum score

510
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
will

511
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,120
at least be higher than the maximum of

512
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,678
this two quantity

513
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,000
and the same argument hold for node 2

514
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,400
node 3 and so on

515
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,320
so overall the maximum score is

516
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,120
guaranteed to be higher than the average

517
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,080
of the maximum of these two quantity

518
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,639
which can be written

519
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,639
in this way

520
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,360
so now we have now need to we just need

521
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,080
to prove that

522
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,199
the expectation of the maximum of these

523
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,720
two quantities

524
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
is higher than our goal

525
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,240
so in a work by horizon imagine and wang

526
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,440
they identify the following potential

527
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,240
function

528
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,240
phi x a and b defined as this

529
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
so the intuition behind this potential

530
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,440
function is the following

531
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,559
so x times 1 minus x is the quality of

532
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,159
the attack

533
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,280
attributed to the bias of the protocol

534
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,320
and the x minus a terms punishes

535
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,520
as alice if her defense is

536
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,080
too far away which is we if her defense

537
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,840
which is a is too far away from the

538
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,960
expected output

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,600
and similarly x minus b square punishes

540
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
bob

541
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,879
if his defense is too far away from the

542
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,879
expected output

543
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,879
so they proved that the maximum of these

544
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
two quantity

545
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,559
is guaranteed to be higher than c over

546
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
square root of r times the potential

547
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,399
function

548
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,400
with input x i a i and b i

549
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,039
so we stress that there could exist

550
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,520
other

551
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,559
potential functions it just happens to

552
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,679
be the case

553
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,559
that this this potential function serves

554
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
our purposes

555
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,520
so now we know that maximum of this

556
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,559
quantity is lower bounded by this

557
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,799
we just need to prove that expectation

558
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,399
of this c over square root of r times

559
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,960
the potential function

560
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,520
is greater than our our goal

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,360
so note that the c over square root of r

562
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,600
appears on both sides

563
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,918
so it suffices to prove that the

564
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,520
expectation of the potential function

565
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:11,440
is greater than x times one minus x

566
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
so we completed the proof in the

567
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,039
following way

568
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,840
so we first note that this potential

569
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
function

570
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,678
actually has can be written in this

571
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,799
another form

572
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,559
which is x plus x minus a minus b

573
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,559
square minus 2 a b

574
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,080
so we what we do is that we first write

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,360
this potential function

576
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,158
in this second form now we can use the

577
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,918
linearity

578
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,919
of the expectation to push the

579
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,720
expectation onto each term individually

580
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,600
now we note that x minus a minus b

581
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,640
squared

582
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,879
is a trivariate convex function so we

583
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,200
can apply jensen's inequality

584
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,520
and push the expectation inside each

585
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,520
term

586
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,440
now finally we note that because alice

587
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,080
and bob's

588
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
view are independent therefore

589
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,639
expectation

590
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,520
of a i times bi is exactly expectation

591
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
of a i

592
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,240
times expectation of bi therefore

593
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,080
we have this identity now

594
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,200
note that this equation is exactly

595
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
in the form of the second form so now we

596
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,720
can written it

597
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,600
back as the potential function with

598
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,799
input

599
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:33,678
expectation of x i expectation from a i

600
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:37,120
and expectation of bi

601
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,159
we want to stress that although this

602
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,199
phi function is not a trivariate convex

603
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,679
function

604
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,960
we actually prove that the jensen's

605
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
inequality

606
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,360
holds for this scenario this is because

607
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
we identify a global invariant which is

608
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,959
this

609
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:01,760
in the augmented protocol that ensures

610
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:04,480
that jensen's inequality holds

611
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
so now the proof falls from the

612
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,840
following simple facts

613
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,080
because the expectation of the expected

614
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,639
output at each children node

615
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,279
is exactly the expected output at the

616
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,559
root

617
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,880
which is x now recall that this

618
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,879
potential function can be written as

619
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,520
the first input x times one minus x plus

620
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,640
two the two squared terms which is

621
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,720
non-negative

622
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
so this is greater than or equal to x

623
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,080
times 1 minus

624
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,080
x and this completes the proof

625
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,520
so now to summarize we have considered

626
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,600
an

627
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,679
r message coin tossing protocol in a

628
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
random oracle model

629
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,520
we use the heavy query algorithm to kill

630
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,879
the correlation between

631
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,400
alice and bob's private view these steps

632
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,799
ask polynomially many additional queries

633
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,279
we use an inductive approach with a

634
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,559
carefully crafted potential function

635
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,400
to identify a stopping time tau such

636
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,279
that the score that we have

637
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,480
defined we have defined with respect to

638
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,600
a stopping time

639
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
is guaranteed to be high now this

640
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,678
stopping time

641
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,840
can be translated into an attack that

642
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,960
will alter the expected output

643
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,000
by the same bond in particular

644
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,159
when this particle output and uniform

645
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,440
bit this uh this deviation to the

646
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,520
expected output

647
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,000
is guaranteed to be one over square root

648
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,000
of r

649
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,080
so i want to mention that in an ongoing

650
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,039
work we prove that the optimal failure

651
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,600
coin tossing

652
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,720
is also black box separated from public

653
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:53,520
key encryption schemes

654
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:55,600
that is all for my talk thank you

655
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,600
you
