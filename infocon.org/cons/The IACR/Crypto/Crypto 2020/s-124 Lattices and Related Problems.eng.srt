uh and the first talk will be on faster

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
enumeration based lattice reduction

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
hermit factor k to the one over k one

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
over two k

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,359
in time k to the k over eight uh

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,439
the papers by martin albright shibrai

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
pianolan foucault paul kirchner damian

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
stellen

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
wang and

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
okay thank you thank you waiting for the

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,360
introduction

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,360
so hello everyone i'm aita and in this

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,360
talk i would like to briefly present our

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
words about a new fast generation based

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
lattice reduction

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,718
so in more details compared to the prior

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
ones are the same type we can reach the

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
same quality while with the smaller time

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
complexity than before

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
and when the dimension of the impulse is

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,680
large enough we can prove this

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
improvement under heuristic assumption

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,480
and when the dimension is small can

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,919
still sold in our simulation that this

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,199
improvement still works for varying

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
accuracy

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,479
and next i like to give a few notations

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
so first

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
lattice is as a regular reach building

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
point

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,119
as you can see the blue points here

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
which can be associated with the

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,159
different species

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,240
and lattice reduction helps to reduce

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
from a perfect system to a good one

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,158
with the most grown basis vectors such

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
as corresponding grand semi vectors

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
have norms are closer to each other than

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
before and we'll call it grand seminars

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
in the later

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
and to quantify the quality of a basis

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
one can use the so-called homie vector

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
and also the normalized relational

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,399
rocomi vector or

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,479
determined by the solid spaces vector

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,920
and denoted as the first one here

51
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,679
and in practice one is mainly

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
interesting in the case lattice

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
reduction for reducing the basis

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
and the b cage aggregate simple reaching

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,399
a location vector k to the 1 to k

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
the time complexity is dominated by the

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
underlying sap solver of size k

58
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,920
which is u to find certain zero vector

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
in a k dimensional tester

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,680
and for the innervation base 1 one can

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
consider the best-known algorithm as the

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
canon's algorithm

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
with the time complexity k to the k over

64
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
2e plus a small d of k

65
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,920
and here we also consider a variant

66
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,560
called sdk z given by

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
sensory and water in 2016 so which

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
promises a good property that can

69
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,760
simplify

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
our analysis and in this work our main

71
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,079
result is for reaching the same local

72
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,160
factor

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
the time complexity we require is

74
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,000
smaller so it's k to the k over eight

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
plus s mod of k our idea is to start

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,440
from

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
an sup solver of smaller sizer denoted

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
as k zero

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
equal k times 208 such that the

80
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
immersion cost

81
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
over this reduce size is well reading

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,799
this

83
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,799
our targeting time complexity k to the

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
clear weight and given a casio

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
dimensional suv solver

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
by because key person about the upper

87
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
bound we can compute the hermit vector

88
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
and also the local effector

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,120
that we can achieve our casual

90
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
dimensionalities

91
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
so now we are contracted here starting

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
solver in ots

93
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
o0 reaching the starting routine factor

94
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,200
in time k to the ko ada

95
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
and next we aim to conjure a new solver

96
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
denoted so one are reaching a small

97
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,799
local factor but

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,159
still in time k to decay weight and this

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
involves two steps

100
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
so first is to run sdbkz without

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,080
starting solver o0

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
to reduce the base season so that for

103
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,239
the corresponding ingress make log

104
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
nonsense

105
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
there is a straight line here outside

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
the last block and then in the second

107
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
step you run an iteration over this

108
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,159
three

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
region and this two step started here

110
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,239
and also in cause the k to decay away

111
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,679
and these two steps together introduced

112
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,040
the new server awana which in a small

113
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,440
loophole factor

114
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,239
but there is also a main drawback so the

115
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,400
dimension

116
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
of the new solver is roughly size k

117
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
larger than b

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
and formally under heuristic assumption

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
we can prove omega one steps are

120
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,799
sufficient for approaching our target

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,959
gingrich vector

122
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,959
so this required the total dimension to

123
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
be roughly omega one second hydrogen in

124
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,840
k

125
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
but this is not satisfiable for keeping

126
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,760
an incisor or cryptosystem like

127
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,239
this candidate where it required the

128
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,840
dimension n to be relatively close to

129
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
the 2k so instead of run an immersion

130
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
over this trailer region we proposed a

131
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,560
practical variant

132
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
and now the immersion zone also covered

133
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
the last block where we assumed to be

134
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,640
educated reduced

135
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
and we also distribute 25 for the right

136
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,560
region

137
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
and 75 percent for the actual zone and

138
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,399
this distribution is near because

139
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,040
it reaches the lowest cost even below

140
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,960
this k to decay weight

141
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
and for simulation you can see the

142
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
simulated cost

143
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
of the practical variant fit well with

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
the k2k

145
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,559
one uh k to the koa curve and the

146
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,719
quality achieved like rokham effector

147
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
achieved by the practical variances well

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,960
with the

149
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,719
is at least as good as the one achieved

150
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
by a standard kz

151
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
and here you can see there's a desk line

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
here even below one way curve

153
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,520
so this denote the cost when we consider

154
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,440
the processing property

155
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,159
and we also leave the zero question for

156
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
future words and i record them here so

157
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
first is to remove the heuristic

158
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
assumption used in our analysis

159
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
and second is to extend our works basing

160
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
on sdbk set here

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,639
to other lattice reduction algorithm and

162
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
further

163
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,240
if we consider the processing for free

164
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
the cost can be below

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
k to the k08 so is it possible to have

166
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
the overall cluster

167
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
still be below this k to the koa by

168
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
maintaining the same quality

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
and last is about the cryptographic

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
relevance of this work

171
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
so in this work we only have a

172
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
simulation analysis for this

173
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,800
small dimension region so it will be

174
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
very interesting to have a formal

175
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
analysis

176
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,840
for this region and then it will be

177
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
interesting to study the

178
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
new crossover pointer between initial

179
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,198
base and c base

180
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,000
lattice reduction for concrete the

181
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
parameter

182
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
so in your base one can consider our new

183
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
algorithm and c-base one can consider

184
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
the jessica base

185
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,960
lattice reduction in our classical and

186
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,639
condensate and this completes my talk

187
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,840
and thank you for your attention

188
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
if you have any questions thanks very

189
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,758
much

190
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,239
are there any questions michael on zulip

191
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
uh

192
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
so far i don't see any

193
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,960
neither on zoom nor on zulip

194
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
okay so we can get the next speaker to

195
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,479
start preparing the talk so cohen

196
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
yeah but if anyone has any questions

197
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,280
about this we could circle back

198
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,318
at the end of the session if we or even

199
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,318
at the end of everything

200
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
i think noah asked the question what's

201
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,240
special about eight

202
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,960
yeah so why k to the k over eight like

203
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:49,840
what

204
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:49,840
where does the eight come from

205
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,039
return i can

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,000
open the micro sorry so yeah okay

207
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,719
so the reason is that once you run sdbk

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,960
set with size case scp server

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
the the emulation cost over this uh last

210
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,080
block will be 10 to the ko2e

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,359
the dimension cost over this trailer

212
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,758
region here

213
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,039
will be k to the kelvin so that's why

214
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,599
this is the

215
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:24,080
is the best cost we can expect because

216
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:27,120
this is the best case like we can reach

217
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,758
in in the sd card reduce basis

218
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
but that is also possible like i said if

219
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,400
you emerge

220
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,400
over this region

221
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,758
you can be even better than a capability

222
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,719
calculator

223
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,720
so it seems there are still possible

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
room to improve like

225
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,039
to uh even better than k to decay weight

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
even to something like over ten so like

227
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,120
a k to the k one but we haven't

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,440
we don't have any conclusion on this yes

229
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,759
sorry i'm not sorry i i respond your

230
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,759
question

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,159
thank you

232
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,199
thank you

233
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
okay so we can move on to the second

234
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
talk of the session

235
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
so this one is on uh random

236
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,479
self-producibility of ideal svp

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,919
via oracle of random walks by colin de

238
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,840
por leo duca

239
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,840
alice pelemeri and benjamin leslovsky

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,919
thank you for the introduction farim uh

241
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
one thing could you maybe raise your

242
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,319
volume because i can't

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,120
uh so if you are going to ask questions

244
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
i

245
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
probably can't hear you if you are this

246
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
soft

247
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,839
uh sorry sorry i turned around at some

248
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,440
point

249
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,800
this is very bad great

250
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,839
um okay so hi i'm kunda buer this is

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
joint work with

252
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
uh

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,160
this talk is about a worst case to

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,440
average case reduction

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
of the hermit svp problem on ideal

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
lattices

257
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,760
and we do this by considering the

258
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,600
space of all ideal lattices of a fixed

259
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,519
number field and that is called

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,600
the arakalov class group

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,640
um okay and

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,440
and we travel from a worst case

263
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,319
to an average case lattice at your

264
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
lattice

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,959
by means of a random walk on this raquel

266
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,880
of class group on this

267
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,319
space of all ideal lattices

268
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,320
okay great

269
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,959
so in our result we consider the hermit

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,440
svp problem the hermit svp problem

271
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
is actually just the svp problem but we

272
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
relate

273
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
the shortest factor rather with the

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
volume volume

275
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,800
than with the shortest vector of that

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
lattice

277
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,880
so and we assume for simplicity that

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
our ideal lattices all have volume one

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,079
we just

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
rescale them so that they have volume

281
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,880
one

282
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,959
okay and our result can actually be

283
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
applied to any number field but it is

284
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,959
particularly nice

285
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
for the cycloatomic name and the second

286
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,599
atomic field

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,519
and in that case it reads as follows

288
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,640
so if you can solve the

289
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,320
gamma hermit svp of over random

290
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,519
ideal lattices you can also

291
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,240
solve gamma prime hemispherp over

292
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,720
any audio lattice where gamma prime has

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,079
a blow up factor of the square root

294
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
of the rank n

295
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,399
how does it relate to previous work well

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,319
a worst case to average case reduction

297
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,440
is already be done by a gantry

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,200
but we improve uh on this result

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,360
in many ways and another important

300
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,600
uh thing i would like to state is that

301
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
our chaos class groups are actually

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
already used in recent

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,240
cryptanalysis but not really stated like

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,040
hey this is another kale of classical

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,920
but more like

306
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,599
a sort of combination of unit group and

307
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,959
class group object

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,279
so it is really nice of this work that

309
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,479
we actually stress the importance of the

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,480
archaeological class group

311
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
and the last point is what i want to say

312
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,640
is that

313
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,640
we we prove something about

314
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
about a random walk the end of the

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,959
random walk should

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
give you a uniform distribution and the

317
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,040
way we prove that

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,480
is actually uh yeah very alike

319
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,399
the proof strategy as in the

320
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,440
self-reduction of the discrete

321
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,200
logarithm problem on elliptic curves

322
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,560
okay so let's go to the actual

323
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,920
result so in the full

324
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,680
video i actually

325
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,479
explained that the space of all ideal

326
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,680
lattices can be parametrized by a circle

327
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,639
or well by a torus but in in

328
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,439
two dimensions it is actually a circle

329
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
and and

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
moving on this circle so this circle is

331
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,399
the archaelov

332
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
class group the space of all ideal

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
letters says

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,120
moving on the circle has the following

335
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,000
effect on the lattices it's

336
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
sort of distorting or it's stretching in

337
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,160
one direction

338
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,639
but pushing in the other direction but

339
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,399
if you want to reduce if you want to use

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,079
like the svp

341
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,720
on the the average case lattice to solve

342
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,199
svp on the worst case lattice it won't

343
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
work

344
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,600
because the the geometry

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,760
of the svp problem is also

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,160
changed it's also disturbed as you can

347
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,760
see the circle is

348
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,079
is an ellipse right now so this is not

349
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,360
we should also have another way of

350
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,680
random walking

351
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
and that's not by distortion not by

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,479
moving continuously

353
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,959
but it is by a specification

354
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,600
and specification is just taking an

355
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,839
ideal

356
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,680
sub lattice so you remove

357
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,320
points you remove points from the

358
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
lattice

359
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,240
such that the the remaining points also

360
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
form an ideal letters but we only

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
considered

362
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,279
ideal lattices with fixed volume so we

363
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,560
have to scale

364
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,680
the ideal letters uh so that it has like

365
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,119
volume one

366
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,239
and then we try to to apply svp we try

367
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
to

368
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,800
do an sp oracle here

369
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,199
but but to use this uh shortest factor

370
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,560
for the original worst case lattice

371
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:58,000
we need to to scale back so also here

372
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,160
we have a sort of yeah disturbation

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,279
of the sawdust factor problem but it is

374
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
very less severe

375
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,959
it's just a scaling not a real

376
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,440
disturbation but

377
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:12,479
more like it is better doable it's a

378
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
nicer distribution so and the intuition

379
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,320
now

380
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,519
is that if you if you apply this

381
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,480
um those two ways of specifically

382
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,839
those two ways of um random walking if

383
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
you combine those

384
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,680
then you hope that the following happens

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,120
so you have actually

386
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,599
the the the con the specification

387
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
uh random walk so those are discrete

388
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,279
jumps

389
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,880
those are quasi randomly

390
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,240
discrete jumps but you also have the way

391
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,079
the continuous the blurring idea

392
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,160
the continuous walk is a sort of

393
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
blurring so you hope that if you have

394
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,600
enough points

395
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,800
and you have enough blurring that you

396
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
reach something

397
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,079
that that that is close to uniform on on

398
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,560
the circle or on the torus on the

399
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,599
archaelov class group the space of all

400
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
ideal lattices

401
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
so we would like to see that the end

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
point

403
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
the end point of the random walk is

404
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,199
actually uniform and

405
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,599
well the intuition is that it actually

406
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,199
is

407
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,120
because of this picture well

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,199
i think that's all thank you for your

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,560
attention and if you have questions

410
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,560
i would like to answer them with all

411
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
pleasure

412
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
okay thank you very much cohen

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,880
and so there is no question on zulip

414
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,319
right now there's a short discussion on

415
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,240
the previous talk but on uh

416
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
zoom people have pointed out that they

417
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,160
really like your your visualization of

418
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,120
the math that's going on so

419
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,439
i uh wanted to also say that it's really

420
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
nice the animation also the full talk i

421
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,759
can only recommend everyone check out

422
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:08,880
the full talk of this

423
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:11,920
thanks thank you very much

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,839
so i uh share my screen

425
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,439
i think i'm next yeah go ahead

426
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
so so michael the discussion of the

427
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,000
previous talk do you want to

428
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,199
do it now or uh

429
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,079
maybe circle back at the end um

430
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,079
let's do all

431
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,079
so you guys can see my slides and

432
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,079
they're like in presentation mode

433
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:40,239
nope black

434
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,719
that's annoying now it looks good

435
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
not a presentation yeah not in

436
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
presentation mode okay i'll just like

437
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,040
share

438
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
did you share a window or a desktop yeah

439
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,759
i'll just share the whole

440
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
screen on the desktop the windows

441
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,000
sharing it's kind of like

442
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,480
i said yeah okay

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
good now

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,199
looks good yep okay

445
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,720
so the next talk i mean noah's giving

446
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
the next two talks and he asked us to

447
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,439
flip them around because one seems to

448
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
depend on the other a bit

449
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
so that's okay so this talk is going to

450
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
be a slide reduction revisited

451
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,039
filling the gaps in sap approximation by

452
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,039
division agarwal

453
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
go ahead noah great uh thanks for team

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,599
and also

455
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,319
uh i just want to thank um danielle and

456
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,000
tom for

457
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
organizing and really excellent

458
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,600
conference under uh unusual and

459
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
unfortunate circumstances

460
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
uh see i'm going to be talking to you

461
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,799
today about uh joint work with uh devest

462
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,600
gianwei and fong

463
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,879
um uh about slide reduction if you don't

464
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,159
know about slide reduction

465
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
i'll tell you a little bit about it it's

466
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,919
really quite a beautiful idea i can say

467
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,639
that it's not it's very much not due to

468
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
me

469
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,200
um so let me start out with the basics

470
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,639
let me just tell you what a lattice is

471
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
so a lattice is a discrete set of

472
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
vectors in

473
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,879
n-dimensional space looks like this in

474
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,120
two dimensions

475
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,760
um it's specified by a basis b1 through

476
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,918
bn of linearly independent vectors

477
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
uh so here's the basis for this lattice

478
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,760
and the lattice itself is the set of all

479
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
integer linear combinations of the basis

480
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,840
vectors we all know this but i'm getting

481
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,918
used to my notation

482
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,280
um and of course like sort of

483
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
one of the fundamental geometric

484
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,039
properties that we care about on the

485
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
lattice

486
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,879
is is this lambda one quantity so this

487
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,240
is the length of the shortest non-zero

488
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,280
vector

489
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
um so here's lambda one for this lattice

490
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,120
and the computational problem that i'm

491
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,240
interested in is svp uh so i want

492
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,000
to find a shortest non-zero vector in in

493
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,360
the lattice so here's a solution to svp

494
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,880
on this lattice

495
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,240
but i'm not interested in the exact

496
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,720
problem so much i'm more interested in

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,559
the approximate problem um so

498
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
uh for the approximate problem we have

499
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,720
some approximation factor gamma

500
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,160
uh that's larger than one and this tells

501
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
us like sort of how much larger than

502
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
lambda one

503
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,080
uh will uh will accept so for example

504
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,559
uh for gamma equals about two or

505
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,439
something at this point will be fine

506
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,960
um uh and of course this problem is

507
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
empty hard i'm not going to show you a

508
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
polynomial time

509
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
uh algorithm uh and one of the things

510
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,918
that i love about this problem is that

511
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
it's interesting for a

512
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,000
ridiculous range of approximation

513
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,918
factors uh from one to two to the n

514
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,480
um uh for crypto we're typically

515
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,280
interested in in gamma equals polyan

516
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,720
um uh and just to note that in this talk

517
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,000
i'm going to talk about provably correct

518
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,840
algorithm so i'm going to say

519
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,360
algorithms are better than other are the

520
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
best known but they're only the best

521
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,159
known if you want to prove their

522
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
correctness their heuristic algorithms

523
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
that are

524
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
uh that outperform these um

525
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
uh uh so the way that we solve

526
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
approximate svp

527
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,678
is actually kind of funny what we do is

528
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,399
we reduce

529
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,760
approximate svp to itself um but in

530
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,919
lower dimensions

531
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
um so we reduce gamma scp and n

532
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,240
dimensions to gamma s

533
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,919
the gamma prime scp and k dimensions um

534
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
where k is less than n that's what makes

535
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
this non-trivial and gamma prime is less

536
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,400
than gamma that's what makes this

537
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,159
sort of not a complete free launch um so

538
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,840
you all probably know the ll algorithm

539
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,360
ll is the special case of k equals two

540
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
um uh but this technique in general

541
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
gives us

542
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
our fastest algorithms uh for

543
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,000
approximate svp

544
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
uh for all gamma uh greater than or

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
equal to n

546
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,159
roughly um and the state of the art is

547
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
gammon when slide reduction

548
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,559
um so here's sort of a visual

549
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
representation of what happens with

550
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,440
relatively small so k is called the

551
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,439
block size this is what happens with

552
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,960
relatively small block size

553
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,919
um so uh what you can see here

554
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,760
is the running time or the constant in

555
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,799
the exponent of the running time

556
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,879
um and the the x-axis is uh

557
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,720
the log base n of the approximation

558
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,559
factor so the approximation factor is

559
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,480
n to the c and this is showing you c um

560
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,559
uh uh and you can see that this function

561
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,880
is essentially gamma to the n over k

562
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
with these weird jumps from a rounding a

563
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,080
rounding issue

564
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,880
um uh and i've drawn two lines here

565
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,799
because they're sort of two different uh

566
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,320
depending on which svp oracle you plug

567
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,639
in you get different results

568
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,000
so the formal the formal result that was

569
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,320
written down

570
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,080
prior as far as i know only had uh

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,678
reduced to exact svp oracle if you're

572
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,918
reduced to approximate svp oracle you

573
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,720
get better results

574
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,760
and we made this formal in our paper so

575
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,640
now it's written down which is

576
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
convenient

577
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
um but more importantly an issue with

578
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,120
this is that

579
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,159
uh there are jumps which is quite

580
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
obvious right so this is like a

581
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,120
piecewise flat

582
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,120
uh function and that's because of this

583
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,760
rounding in the approximation factor

584
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,799
um and these jumps happen because the

585
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
block size k

586
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,520
has to divide the dimension n um

587
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,120
uh and another issue is that there was

588
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
nothing non-trivial known

589
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,199
for gamma less than or equal to n so for

590
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,480
gamma less than or equal to n

591
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
um uh as far as we know uh

592
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,880
the problems just as as far as we knew

593
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
the problem was just as hard as

594
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,520
the exact problem or constant factor

595
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
approximate um

596
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
and this is kind of a bummer because

597
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
like cryptography really cares about

598
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
this regime

599
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,799
we care about like small polynomial

600
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
factors um

601
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,559
so our work uh made the graph look like

602
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,959
this

603
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,120
um that's what we did um so in

604
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,440
particular there are no jumps anymore

605
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,719
um so we can handle any block size um

606
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,880
uh the block slice doesn't need to

607
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
divide the dimension um

608
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
and we get the exact same approximation

609
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
factor except we don't have this ceiling

610
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,840
in the exponent

611
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,639
um so that's fine we also have an

612
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,840
entirely different reduction that works

613
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
in the regime where there are sort of

614
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
fewer than two blocks when the block

615
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
size is larger

616
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,840
than n over two um and this lets us get

617
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,840
non-trivial results below

618
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,080
n um uh we get this approximation factor

619
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,120
uh

620
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,720
n to the n over 2k in that regime um

621
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,520
and this seems kind of natural because

622
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,679
there's a real sort of natural barrier

623
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,120
uh that comes at square root n which is

624
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
which is the best that we can do

625
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
that's kind of because for the experts

626
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
that's because we apply minkowski's

627
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
theorem and sort of once you apply

628
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,080
minkowski's theorem

629
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,320
you spend a square root n um

630
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,158
uh so let me just show you in pictures

631
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
uh how our algorithm works i'm not going

632
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,600
to explain what these pictures mean

633
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
um but you can pretend your base is

634
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,158
upper triangular uh

635
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,039
and you can break your basis up into

636
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,880
blocks

637
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,400
um slide reduction breaks your basis up

638
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
into two different kinds of blocks blue

639
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
and red

640
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,440
uh that are that are represented here

641
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
they're svp reduced and dual suv reduced

642
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
and it gives you this sort of elegant a

643
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,360
little shifted slided thing

644
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,120
um we did this so we added a green and

645
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,678
orange block to the front

646
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,479
um and our green and orange blocks are

647
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,159
hsvp reduced so we do a weaker thing

648
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,600
to the first block which we make a

649
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,240
little bit bigger to account for the

650
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,918
fact that

651
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,600
we have some sort of extra dimensions

652
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,840
because k doesn't divide n

653
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,879
uh so that's what we do for a small

654
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,039
block size

655
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,960
uh for very large block size we we do

656
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,480
something else

657
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,840
um so that's that's what i wanted to say

658
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you

659
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,120
okay thank you noah i guess you can get

660
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,399
your next slides ready

661
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:20,239
wait for questions okay

662
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,240
so again so far no questions yet and

663
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,440
maybe maybe i have one so you mentioned

664
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,840
that

665
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,960
this you know this exponent with the

666
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,439
minus one

667
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,640
seems like minor at first sight but you

668
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,559
mentioned that you know like uh

669
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
this corresponds to a pony effector that

670
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,080
we really care about in crypto

671
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,799
yeah um so so does this work have any

672
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,960
like direct implications for crypto or

673
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,279
like is it purely for understanding or

674
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,520
like

675
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,120
what's uh i mean yeah so

676
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
it only has direct application for

677
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,158
crypto if you require your adversary to

678
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,799
prove

679
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,080
uh that his algorithm works right if the

680
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
adversary doesn't have to prove that his

681
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,120
algorithm works you could just run

682
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,120
uh bkz which heuristically

683
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,719
achieves roughly the same approximation

684
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,399
factor or actually you can solve for

685
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
meet svp in almost all cases

686
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
in which case you can use your algorithm

687
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,960
um right

688
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,480
self dual bkz do you see any

689
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,840
applications where this could

690
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,200
you know in practice even uh

691
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,799
no but i mean part of that's just

692
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
because it's not implemented right it's

693
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,158
it's plausible that

694
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
uh it actually performs uh even better

695
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,520
in practice i have no idea

696
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
um i guess you guys did some experiments

697
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
with slide reduction at some point and

698
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,840
found that it

699
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,240
didn't perform incredibly well if i

700
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,399
remember currently

701
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,840
yeah but also not too bad not as bad as

702
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
was expected

703
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,120
i i remember but the idea i guess puts

704
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,799
it uh

705
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
nicely it says that it can give ideas

706
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,200
for better heuristic algorithms in some

707
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
sense so

708
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,960
but i would classify that under giving a

709
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,559
better understanding i guess

710
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
yeah and my thought is just like we want

711
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480
to understand this as well as possible

712
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,879
because it's really important

713
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,880
okay fair enough cool thanks

714
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,120
okay thanks uh so here's noah again

715
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,600
giving a talk on lattice reduction for

716
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,600
models or how to reduce module svp to

717
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,799
module svp joint work with tamalika

718
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,360
mukerji

719
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,440
yeah so as vadim said this is this is

720
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,799
trying to work with tamaleka mukherjee

721
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,720
she's a a phd student at purdue um

722
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,480
and i'm told nobody finds our title to

723
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,799
be funny i thought how to reduce module

724
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,679
speech to module svp was a funny title

725
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,240
um but anyway so i'm going to repeat

726
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,520
what i did in the last

727
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,600
talk i'm going to do it slightly faster

728
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,360
and i made some minor changes which i

729
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,480
hope you'll sort of ignore

730
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,000
um but a lattice is the integer span of

731
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,200
finitely many vectors

732
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
rational vectors um so again here's a

733
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,559
lattice

734
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
and it's the integer span so it's some

735
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,320
integer times y1

736
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,720
plus some integer times y2 etc um

737
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,000
and again like the sort of geometric

738
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,640
property that we're interested in

739
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,760
is uh the length of the shortest vector

740
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,159
or the short vectors in the lattice

741
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,039
so again we're interested in solving svp

742
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,120
not exact svp but approximate svp

743
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,480
um and again this problem is interesting

744
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,600
for a really wide range of parameters

745
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,520
um but i'm not interested in solving

746
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,639
um for this talk i'm not interested in

747
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,320
solving svp on

748
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,679
any old lattice i'm interested in

749
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,240
solving stp

750
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
um on a very specific class of lattices

751
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,640
um a specific class of lattices with a

752
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,879
rather dense definition so they're

753
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,399
called module lattices so the formal

754
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
definition you start out with a number

755
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,439
field which is uh the polynomials over

756
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,360
over the rationals uh modulus and

757
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,960
irreducible polynomial

758
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,799
and you take a ring or formula it's

759
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,000
called an order um

760
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:54,080
which is a non-non-degenerate uh uh

761
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,799
sub ring of the uh ring of integers of

762
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,960
of your um number field um and then a

763
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,158
module lattice is the r span of finitely

764
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,240
many vectors

765
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,440
um uh uh in k to the k

766
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,480
um so uh before we had the z

767
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
span of rational vectors now we have the

768
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,799
r

769
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:18,240
span of um uh vectors that live

770
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:21,039
uh over this number field um

771
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
uh and k is itself an n-dimensional

772
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,679
vector space over q

773
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,960
so if we view k as uh q to the n via

774
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,120
some embedding

775
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,080
um then this is actually a lattice

776
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,520
you'll notice that's closed

777
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,240
under um uh addition which is all you

778
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
need

779
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
um so that means we can define things

780
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
like short vectors we can define lambda

781
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
one

782
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,960
um which is fun um and the

783
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,039
the number k which is sort of the

784
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,159
dimension of this number field i'm lying

785
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,960
slightly here

786
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,320
uh is is the rank of the module um and

787
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,279
that's sort of the key number that we

788
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,639
care about

789
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,799
um so that's the formal definition

790
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,919
intuitive definition is much simpler

791
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,320
a module lattice is uh it lives in q to

792
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,440
the k

793
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
n um and it's just some lattice that has

794
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,480
some linear symmetries

795
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
uh in particular you can so you can

796
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,039
apply a linear transformation to a

797
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
lattice vector and you'll get another

798
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,799
lattice vector back

799
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,639
um and the set of symmetries is exactly

800
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,440
uh this ring r

801
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,559
um unfortunately this definition uh has

802
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,679
a lot of problems but that's how you

803
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
should think of it they're just sort of

804
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
very pretty lattices

805
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,080
um that that are closed under

806
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,600
um that are very symmetric i guess um in

807
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,399
particular since module lattices are

808
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,678
lattices

809
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,158
we can ask about solving svp on them um

810
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,600
so we can define gamma module svp as the

811
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,559
problem gamma svp

812
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
restricted to to module lattices um and

813
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,200
of course

814
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,199
like this only makes sense if you like

815
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
specify which ring r you're talking

816
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,919
about and which embedding and

817
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,200
uh there's all this mess um

818
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,960
and it turns out that to break most

819
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,320
lattice crypto that's used in practice

820
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,039
it suffices to

821
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,240
uh solve gamma module svp in particular

822
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,600
if you want to uh

823
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,039
break all remaining um uh candidates for

824
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,719
the the nist competition lattice

825
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,840
candidates for the nist competition

826
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,520
uh module scp is enough um

827
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,520
so here's how we solve module svp

828
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,039
currently it's not very exciting

829
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,679
um we observe that gamma module svp

830
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,320
with a rank k module is a is an instance

831
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,919
of gamma svp in kn dimensions

832
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,439
uh that's just because this is a kn

833
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,760
dimensional lattice

834
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
um and then we apply lattice reduction

835
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,960
uh so in other words we just solve this

836
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,399
gamma svp the way we normally would

837
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
which is to reduce it to a lower

838
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
dimensional

839
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,760
um uh problem like like i discussed in

840
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,840
my previous talk

841
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,799
um and if we could do significantly

842
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,799
better than this

843
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,399
then a lot of crypto will be broken in

844
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
practice modulo

845
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,840
an asterisk here which is like hiding a

846
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,918
tremendous amount and

847
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
uh uh read the paper and the citations

848
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,039
therein to to learn the current state of

849
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,840
the art

850
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,760
um so that's scary so there's this fear

851
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,039
that maybe modules are special and if

852
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,360
modules are special

853
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,879
then a lot of our crypto would not be as

854
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,240
secure as we think it is

855
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,440
um uh and you might previously have

856
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
conjectured

857
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,440
um that it's just as hard to solve uh

858
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,679
svpn modules as it is to solve it in s

859
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
on uh generic lattices but that's

860
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,200
actually not true

861
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,158
in the rank one case so in the rank one

862
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,720
case uh modules are called ideals um

863
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,000
and there is a now a long line of work

864
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
quite recent work

865
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
uh showing uh that there are faster

866
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,240
algorithms

867
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,440
um for ideal svp uh with even more

868
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,039
asterisks

869
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,960
um uh and this

870
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,240
this doesn't directly bake crypto

871
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,760
because for crypto

872
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
actually we care about higher rank

873
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,440
modules um it also doesn't break it for

874
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,360
other reasons which is why there are

875
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
many asterisks but morally

876
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,399
there's sort of this boundary if we want

877
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
to break crypto

878
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,600
we need to go from rank 1 to higher rank

879
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,799
um so here's a sort of natural approach

880
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,120
to try to

881
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,440
solve module svp instead of

882
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,879
reducing module spp to svp and then

883
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,799
reducing svp to itself

884
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,200
why don't we just reduce module svp to

885
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,600
itself so why don't we reduce module svp

886
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,559
with rank k it's a module stp with rank

887
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,918
beta for a beta less than k

888
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,399
and this would be something like lattice

889
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,120
reduction or basis reduction for modules

890
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,320
um and of course this uh this diagram

891
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,639
sort of commutes

892
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,240
um uh so this would be like a strict

893
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,519
improvement if we could do this

894
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
at least if all the numbers were the

895
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,799
same

896
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,199
um and of course if we could do this for

897
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,879
beta equals one we'd

898
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,320
more or less break a lot of crypto up to

899
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,519
many asterisks

900
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,439
um and uh in a recent beautiful work lee

901
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,919
pellet mary stella and wallet

902
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,720
um showed that this does work for beta

903
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,880
equals two

904
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,039
so beta equals one break breaks crypto

905
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
they pull it off for beta equals two

906
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,679
um uh maybe i can uh

907
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,039
uh leave you in a little bit of suspense

908
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,320
i can say oh what are we gonna do are we

909
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,960
gonna get beta equals one

910
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,399
uh the answer no uh we get beta greater

911
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,679
than or equal to two

912
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,120
um uh so we show that uh uh you can sort

913
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,960
of trade off rank and approximation

914
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,760
factor however you want as long as

915
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,360
uh you stay above rank one um and you

916
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,600
can think of this as

917
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,799
uh so we use slide reduction techniques

918
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,678
like the techniques i discussed in the

919
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,639
previous talk

920
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,960
and you can think of um our work as sort

921
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,840
of

922
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
generalizing lpsw in the same way that

923
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,720
slide reduction generates

924
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,918
uh generalizes lll um so this is the

925
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,200
current picture

926
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,320
um uh

927
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,640
and the moral is that a module scp

928
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,519
oracle is just as good as an svp oracle

929
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,600
for solving a module svp um

930
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
uh and of course the big question here

931
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,879
is does this mean so there are two ways

932
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,240
to interpret a reduction

933
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
should i think of this as meaning that

934
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
high rank module scp is easy which would

935
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,320
be bad for crypto or that low rank

936
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,799
module scp is hard for beta greater than

937
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,559
one

938
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,840
in particular is there's this huge gap

939
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,960
between beta equals one and b

940
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,399
equals two uh or not um and here's my

941
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
answer to that question

942
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,320
uh i have no idea i think we should

943
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,840
study it more uh thanks i think i went

944
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,840
significantly over time

945
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,200
uh thank you noah um are there any

946
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,159
questions michael not that i could see

947
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,199
any

948
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,599
no maybe i can ask one um

949
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,960
so i mean you put a lot of uh you know

950
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,040
asterisks

951
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
there but uh on the on the last slide

952
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,119
where you use

953
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,800
when you put almost in parentheses

954
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,159
um is it is it is the paper

955
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,079
stronger than the other i mean how

956
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,560
almost is oh uh

957
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,520
so you use a small polynomial factor

958
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,799
well for parameter

959
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,639
natural parameters you use a small

960
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,879
polynomial factor in the

961
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,679
um uh approximation factor

962
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,960
um polynomial in the rank or polynomial

963
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,399
in the dimension

964
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,760
in the dimension yeah yeah yeah so you

965
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,680
lose like a factor

966
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:04,640
of like square root n to the um

967
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,960
a over um something like this

968
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,839
okay okay the question did come up on

969
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,200
sunday

970
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,599
by rohit chattery um

971
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,680
and i'm gonna cite this uh can you

972
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,320
briefly explain the reductions depending

973
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,359
dependence on the underlying ring

974
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,880
yeah um so

975
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,359
we worked really really hard we actually

976
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,480
just updated the paper said it works for

977
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,279
um uh arbitrary orders uh which is

978
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,680
pretty fun

979
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
um the geometry of the ring affects the

980
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,919
approximation factor

981
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,359
um and i think sort of the the high

982
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
order effect

983
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,279
of the geometry of the ring is uh so

984
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,800
it's like well known that minkowski's

985
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,040
theorem is tight up to a factor square

986
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,920
root n for example in cyclotomics

987
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,680
um uh and that factor of square root n

988
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,040
more generally so like the sort of

989
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,720
how loose minkowski's theorem can be uh

990
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
there's probably a better a name for

991
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,439
this uh parameter but i'm not thinking

992
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
of it right now

993
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,839
um but how loose minkowski's theorem can

994
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,399
be affects your approximation factor

995
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,200
um so if you take like a really really

996
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,240
wonky

997
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,520
um uh ring then you'll get a bad

998
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,479
approximation factor although the

999
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,520
reduction still

1000
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,960
still does formally work

1001
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,720
okay and uh another question by the same

1002
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,240
auth by the same same person uh again

1003
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,520
would your dense module reduction

1004
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,359
technique also imply something

1005
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,759
non-trivial if translated to the usual

1006
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,680
letter setting

1007
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,119
uh so i think the answer is yes so

1008
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,799
you can think of what we're doing as

1009
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,400
sort of instead of working with vectors

1010
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
we work with sub lattices

1011
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,160
um and you know we work really hard to

1012
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,520
make the

1013
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,040
sub lattices modules but if you don't

1014
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,240
care about that i think it still makes

1015
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,960
sense to think about

1016
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,680
a more general form of lattice reduction

1017
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,280
in which

1018
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,598
instead of looking for short vectors

1019
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,960
you're looking for dense sub lattices

1020
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,040
i think this is this is what the

1021
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
question's getting at um and i think our

1022
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,599
techniques just sort of immediately work

1023
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,320
for that

1024
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,839
uh i'm not uh we kind of mentioned that

1025
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,119
in paper

1026
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,480
but i'm not sure how interesting it is

1027
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,560
maybe maybe i didn't answer the question

1028
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,720
i'm not sure

1029
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
okay do we have time for more questions

1030
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,040
for him

1031
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,880
uh yeah go ahead okay so leo is asking

1032
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,079
if there's any hope to eliminate the cn

1033
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,440
assumption on the number field

1034
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
the the what assumption on the number

1035
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,440
field oh that's gone

1036
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,480
uh so yes there is hope um actually

1037
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,200
for this we we we stole uh uh we

1038
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
we used ideas from lpsw and lpsw they

1039
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,359
work with

1040
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,800
uh k sub r um and if you do that

1041
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,359
k tensored with r and if you do that

1042
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,760
properly uh uh you can get any number

1043
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,880
field

1044
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:50,560
so yes okay

1045
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,800
and then there is another question by

1046
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,078
daniel where i'm not entirely sure of it

1047
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
no it does concerns this

1048
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,079
this paper so i'm just going to read it

1049
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,598
out um in the spirit of getting rid of

1050
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,520
these piecewise drums

1051
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,760
is there an interesting way to define a

1052
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,599
reasonable form of mutual rbe

1053
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,680
that somehow in between rank 1 and rank

1054
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,480
2 where you could get non-tribal attacks

1055
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,598
meaning

1056
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,880
attacks that look more like the rank 1

1057
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,119
attacks and the rank 2

1058
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,800
plus attacks uh i mean

1059
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,720
i think that falls into the general

1060
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
category of trying to figure out how to

1061
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,480
port these

1062
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
ideal svp algorithms to module scp for

1063
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,240
rank two

1064
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,920
uh which i think like we're all kind of

1065
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,560
thinking about at least a little bit

1066
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,520
uh uh if if if i had an idea there i'd

1067
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,599
be very happy

1068
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,680
or kind of sad actually but yeah that's

1069
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,800
that's like a heart problem

1070
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,919
okay cool i think uh

1071
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,440
this covers all of the questions so far

1072
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,320
great thank you so much so maybe tamar

1073
00:38:47,440 --> 00:39:01,839
can get

1074
00:38:48,320 --> 00:39:01,839
your slides up uh oh yeah

1075
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,400
yeah can you see my screen

1076
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,040
hello no we can see you ah okay

1077
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,440
[Music]

1078
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,839
okay wait uh maybe just let me and we

1079
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
don't

1080
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,560
maybe while tomorrow is setting up noah

1081
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,040
what is the c or leo what is the cm

1082
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
assumption

1083
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,440
complex multiplication yeah it's it's

1084
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,598
it's that the

1085
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,200
um the number field is a complex

1086
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,680
multiplication field

1087
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,279
uh it uh it basically means that the

1088
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,879
number field is closed under

1089
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,119
conjugation um in a in a very specific

1090
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
way

1091
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,520
so what's what's the um reveal of this

1092
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,720
knot for example

1093
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:22,839
uh so like cube root of two so

1094
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:24,879
qx mod uh x q minus two is not right

1095
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,400
okay so these are all

1096
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,000
real no no so it has a it has a complex

1097
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,520
and it has these two complex embeddings

1098
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
but you sort of can't get to one from

1099
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,160
the other

1100
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,160
great okay

1101
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,440
thanks

1102
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,400
okay i think tomorrow's ready now yeah

1103
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,359
it's working

1104
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,800
yeah sorry sorry to reboot everything

1105
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,160
very good

1106
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,370
uh okay so now the next talk is uh by

1107
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
uh thomas

1108
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,920
[Music]

1109
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,598
on fast reduction of algebraic lattices

1110
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,440
and i will give the talk

1111
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,119
so thank you for the introduction so

1112
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,079
yeah so basically in this talk i'm going

1113
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,400
to present some

1114
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,880
results on this time not proof but

1115
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,160
heuristic results uh on the reduction of

1116
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,720
algebraic lattice

1117
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,480
and on the difference of uh the talk we

1118
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,200
we've just we've just saw by noaa

1119
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,880
uh we were not really interested in uh

1120
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,598
having theoretical

1121
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,960
results relying on using sap records but

1122
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,640
we wanted to have

1123
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,480
um unconditional uh reduction uh

1124
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,640
so that we could implement implement it

1125
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,839
and and and do some tests

1126
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,598
so sorry yeah so just very quick recall

1127
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,400
on the snl because like everyone has

1128
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,920
done them

1129
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,760
uh just before so um

1130
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,119
recall that the lattice is a discrete

1131
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,640
sub groove for your player in space

1132
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,319
let's say r2cn

1133
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,240
and another way of defining that maybe

1134
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,839
which is more algebraic is to say that

1135
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,439
it's a freezy module

1136
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,520
of finance rank which is endowed with

1137
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,880
some inner product on

1138
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,640
the ambient space and on lattices we

1139
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,240
have this beautiful minkowski theorem

1140
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,759
for the first minima which has said that

1141
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,040
if i give you a lattice there exists

1142
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,800
necessarily a vector of a short norm

1143
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,880
so which means which is that up to

1144
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,920
square root of the dimension

1145
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,960
close to the normalized volume okay

1146
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,079
so as you all know finding this

1147
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,680
kind of short vector is a hard problem

1148
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,440
and we're all interested in in solving

1149
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,919
that however in

1150
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,920
82 the inference from novatch exhibits

1151
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,640
that a polynomial time algorithm which

1152
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,720
solves this uh search of a short vector

1153
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,960
up to exponential approximation factor

1154
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,839
and this has like numerous application

1155
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,839
uh in

1156
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,200
uh numbers here in like algebraic

1157
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,720
algebraic number theory

1158
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,960
difference approximation of course

1159
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,359
cryptanalysis and uh

1160
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
of course in lattice-based crypto and

1161
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,560
it's nowadays also

1162
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,960
uh like kind of basic building blocks

1163
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,200
of any uh algorithm in computational

1164
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,720
algebraic number theory because it helps

1165
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,078
somehow to

1166
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,078
control the size of the elements

1167
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,119
appearing there so ll is like

1168
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,480
everywhere and now we are getting

1169
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,119
interested more and more

1170
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,119
uh into a broader class of lattices

1171
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,160
called algebraic lattice

1172
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,839
and this lattices lives in uh over

1173
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,640
number fields which are finite extension

1174
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,040
of q

1175
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,480
and which you can realize this uh this

1176
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,680
extension as

1177
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,240
a polynomial quotient of q x over uh

1178
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,240
over some hydrogenated bipolar and

1179
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,479
inside this field you have a very

1180
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,479
interesting ring which is the ring of

1181
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,839
integers which is a set of elements

1182
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,599
which vanish under the action of

1183
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:39,200
some monique polynomial in the x so

1184
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,760
over q it's just the integers itself and

1185
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,799
you could think of somehow these ring of

1186
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,560
intentions as a

1187
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
higher order generalization of the

1188
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,078
integers

1189
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,200
so why it's related to lattices so as i

1190
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,000
said we could uh

1191
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,598
thought of lattices as 3d module uh and

1192
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,560
all with some inner products

1193
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,640
and as i said we can generate z to be

1194
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,400
this ring of integers so we can generate

1195
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
lattices to say that an algebraic

1196
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,480
lattice is an oil module

1197
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,920
uh angled with some inner product on the

1198
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,640
ambient space

1199
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,440
okay so you could ask what is the inner

1200
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,960
product and

1201
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,040
you can find some canonical way of

1202
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
defining it using the embeddings into cn

1203
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,839
i'm not entering two tests here

1204
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,040
uh but what should be uh like the motto

1205
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,040
of all of this is that

1206
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,800
an algebraic lattice is a lattice with

1207
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,040
some additional algebraic structure

1208
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,880
and this algebraic structure translates

1209
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,079
metrically into symmetries

1210
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,720
okay and now how we do lattice reduction

1211
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,160
on that

1212
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,439
so just to to set up a bit of context

1213
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,799
like a noah spoke about like idealities

1214
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,560
and modularities which are kind of

1215
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,839
particular cases of this algebraic

1216
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,599
lattices

1217
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,279
and like if we could exploit these

1218
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,200
additional symmetries and

1219
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,640
uh i mean sorry exploiting this

1220
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,359
additional symmetry has been already

1221
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,480
used

1222
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,960
uh but on the constructive side to uh

1223
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,880
to exhibit more compact and more

1224
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,640
efficient cryptographic primitives

1225
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,160
and many lattice-based candidates of the

1226
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,480
next competition are actually

1227
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:07,200
relying heavily on this module lattices

1228
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,400
and uh we would like to reduce them for

1229
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,680
instance from a cryptographical

1230
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,880
perspective just to evaluate the

1231
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,200
security of these nist

1232
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,520
candidates so our goal would be to find

1233
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,040
a way to use the algebraic structure

1234
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,640
to give a faster lll type reduction

1235
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,160
so how we can do that

1236
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,400
is that for free when you are

1237
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,598
considering this algebraic lattices you

1238
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,359
can have

1239
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,520
for suitable fields a natural recursive

1240
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,119
regulation structure of subfield the

1241
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,880
torah subfield and

1242
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,400
we showed that we could explore this

1243
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,240
recursive uh tower

1244
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,599
uh translate it into a recursive

1245
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,720
strategy uh

1246
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,599
which at each step uh we'll do we'll use

1247
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,399
the symmetries to do lattice reduction

1248
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,440
and

1249
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,079
another thing that we used there was to

1250
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,880
exhibit some part of the unit group and

1251
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,839
use them

1252
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,119
in some specific way to control the size

1253
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,359
of the elements which occurred during

1254
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,079
the reduction somehow it's very

1255
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,319
related to the condition number of the

1256
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,000
matrices appearing during computation so

1257
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,079
if you are able to use the unit group to

1258
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,160
control the size the

1259
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,520
condition number of the matrices you are

1260
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,040
using basically you can reduce the

1261
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,880
precision

1262
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,279
required to do a reduction so

1263
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,800
just to show you how the reduction is

1264
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,960
working on a very high level

1265
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,480
if you want to reduce rank and lattice

1266
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,680
you will do basically the same as you

1267
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
would do in ll

1268
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,598
so you will start by transforming

1269
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,839
everything into triangular matrices by

1270
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,000
qr decomposition and then you will

1271
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,400
feed that to your size reduction sub

1272
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
procedures which is a simple procedure

1273
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,240
used to

1274
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,880
as a name indicates to shrink the size

1275
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,720
of the vector

1276
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,720
without not touching the order of

1277
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,439
difficulty basis and this is where we

1278
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,959
need

1279
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,920
this unit rounding procedure

1280
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,599
and the rest is just working coefficient

1281
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,079
wise because we're working with

1282
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,079
modular query numbers and then we do

1283
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,760
exactly as in

1284
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,520
ll we reduce the problem to

1285
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,400
solving the same instance but on

1286
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,800
multiple rank two projected sub-lattices

1287
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,319
so if we are working over q itself over

1288
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,440
z basically we can

1289
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:17,520
uh just uh use gauss algorithm or a bit

1290
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,599
faster seanage algorithm and we don't

1291
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,240
but if we're not what we're going to do

1292
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,960
is to descend this wrong two lattice

1293
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,520
to the subfield just under where the uh

1294
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,160
of course

1295
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,200
the rank of the new sublet of the new

1296
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,200
lattice is bigger

1297
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,720
but then we can recursively apply the

1298
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,040
wall procedure

1299
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,799
and once our algorithms say okay my

1300
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,880
wrong two sub lattice is reduced what i

1301
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,839
need to do is to lift the results to the

1302
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,720
upper field

1303
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,920
and this is done in the same with a

1304
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,919
generic

1305
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,359
euclidean algorithm which is generalized

1306
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,880
to work in

1307
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,040
numbers uh okay

1308
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,480
and uh we can even do a bit of

1309
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,880
optimization

1310
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,160
on this and all of this qr decomposition

1311
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,680
plus size reduction

1312
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,520
can be done with only half of the

1313
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,480
required computation using

1314
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,359
uh some additional um structure which

1315
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,720
comes from the

1316
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:09,040
sympathetic symmetries that we can

1317
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,078
construct so we just say word of that

1318
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,558
at the end um so

1319
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,480
if we analyze that in a heuristic way

1320
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,599
because they are relying on some using

1321
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,640
the size of the elements of link

1322
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,920
everywhere

1323
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,319
basically you can prove that on

1324
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,599
cycloatomic fields if you want to reduce

1325
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,000
a wrong tool like this

1326
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,200
we can do that in times o soft of n

1327
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,160
square b

1328
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,118
b being the size of the bit size of the

1329
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,399
of the input

1330
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,040
and if you use the state-of-the-art lll

1331
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,640
directly

1332
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,640
on the corresponding lattice it will

1333
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,040
require something in all sort of n

1334
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,118
fourth so you gain a factor which is of

1335
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,640
the order of n squared

1336
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,319
but there is a slight drawback is that

1337
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,319
now the approximation factor is not 2 to

1338
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,960
the n like ll but it is two to the

1339
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,839
uh softer of n so it's way faster but

1340
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,280
it's

1341
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,440
you get vectors are slightly bigger uh

1342
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,440
and i said that you could do uh even

1343
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,960
better using simplex symmetry so this is

1344
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,559
kind of a generalization algebraic

1345
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,920
generalization of the work of

1346
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,680
gamma gargame and green in o6

1347
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,680
so the basic idea is that if you take a

1348
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,000
wrong two lattice just a plain lattice

1349
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,200
um then it is naturally simplified this

1350
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
means that you have

1351
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,240
some action of the simplified group on

1352
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,839
it and

1353
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,160
the same is absolutely true for

1354
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,720
algebraic lattices of wrong two so

1355
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,680
you can find a natural way a canonical

1356
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,879
way of

1357
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,520
having additional symmetries

1358
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,000
and what we proved is that we can do

1359
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,800
that at

1360
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,960
each of the recursive level so we can

1361
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,280
create synthetic symmetries at each of

1362
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,839
the

1363
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,359
uh of the nodes of the recursion tree so

1364
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,400
that means that we

1365
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,960
can have the computation of the computer

1366
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,359
in time

1367
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,480
at each node of the recursion tree so

1368
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,160
since the

1369
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,000
tower of recursion is something

1370
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,200
logarithmic in the

1371
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,680
dimension you can get a polynomial again

1372
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,240
so if we look at the improved complexity

1373
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,640
in this case if i retake the example of

1374
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,160
psychoatomic fields basically we can uh

1375
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,598
we can do some radiation

1376
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,399
sorry oh let me see last slide it's a

1377
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,720
less like okay we can do so we can find

1378
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,800
we can reduce a lattice in time

1379
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,839
n square minus a little something which

1380
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,920
depends on

1381
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,640
the field you are considering so we even

1382
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,400
beat this n square b bound

1383
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,078
using this additional symmetries and of

1384
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,680
course we still have an approximation

1385
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,800
factor which is slightly worse

1386
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,440
than before and uh in practice

1387
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,200
uh we implemented all of that uh and we

1388
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,800
were able to reduce like ggs like

1389
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,399
lattices in four days where

1390
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,079
our estimation for state of the art

1391
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,400
would be uh for

1392
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,760
forty thousand years and we were able to

1393
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,800
run for the first time getting three

1394
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,960
algorithms in dimension 1024 in

1395
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,640
100 hours where fpl would take 10 years

1396
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,000
so if you have questions please ask me

1397
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,078
i'd be very happy to answer them thank

1398
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,559
you for your attention

1399
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,160
thanks are there any questions on the

1400
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,280
boards michael

1401
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,759
yeah there's one um he was asking

1402
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,640
stuff you could set up your uh your

1403
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,000
slides while

1404
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,598
we're asking questions so we can have

1405
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,599
more time for questions for you as well

1406
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,200
yeah okay

1407
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,599
now ready for the question okay so leo

1408
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,480
is asking is an approximation factor of

1409
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,319
you

1410
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,839
which ll like algorithm relevant to the

1411
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,279
cryptanalysis of simple encryption

1412
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,480
signature schemes such as in this

1413
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,160
candidate

1414
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,920
uh no no no the approximation are too

1415
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,279
too too large for the momentum because

1416
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,280
it's the ll type so

1417
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,040
what you need to do secret analysis of

1418
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,440
like signature whatever

1419
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,319
is uh approximation factor which can

1420
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,119
only achieve with

1421
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,240
the easy type algorithm so for the

1422
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,599
moment it's really

1423
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,520
in the realm of failure so

1424
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,359
so like exponential approximation factor

1425
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,000
in polynomial achieved in personal time

1426
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,000
so

1427
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,960
for this candidate is it's for the

1428
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,200
moment too large

1429
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,640
for fpg you can do stuff but for for

1430
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,960
later it's for

1431
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,598
nice candidates you really need way way

1432
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,960
uh stronger reduction

1433
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,960
okay good thanks

1434
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,359
okay so um the next last talk of the

1435
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,559
session

1436
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:33,839
is rowdy names by feng hao liu and

1437
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:33,839
jedong wang and jadon will give the talk

1438
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,000
okay all right so hello everyone i'm

1439
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,800
jordan i will talk about wrongly in the

1440
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,960
rings

1441
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,440
uh this is joint work with fungal leo

1442
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,480
and this work focuses on determining the

1443
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,839
harness of l

1444
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,559
over rings okay so let me

1445
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,319
start with the definition of uh learning

1446
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,720
with running over rings

1447
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,680
which was firstly proposed by bernard

1448
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,118
piher and rose

1449
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,240
in trinidad uh the ring rbr is defined

1450
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,280
with parameters p

1451
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,399
q and zeroing r uh the third problem is

1452
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,520
to find secret

1453
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,000
secretness from a given symbols as a b

1454
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,160
where a is a random element in r sub q

1455
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,960
and a b equals to the range of a times

1456
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,920
s the running of an element x with

1457
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,319
respect to p

1458
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,119
and q is defined as the ranking of p

1459
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,800
over q times

1460
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,240
x the mod p okay so the decision problem

1461
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,280
is to distinguish

1462
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,879
the pair of av from uniform random pair

1463
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,200
green otherwise has many crypto

1464
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,040
applications such as pseudorandom

1465
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,759
functions computational reusability

1466
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,640
structure

1467
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,200
those travel functions and more so it is

1468
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,520
important

1469
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,839
to determine the harness of this problem

1470
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,119
i summarize prior harness results of

1471
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,960
playing lwr

1472
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,920
and ring out there by the falling

1473
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,359
figures more precisely we consider the

1474
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,760
hardest of these problems

1475
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,720
in two cases which is super poorly

1476
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,760
modulus and

1477
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,759
with poly modulus

1478
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,640
for planar for playing other player the

1479
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,839
harness results are more complete

1480
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,640
however in the ring setting results are

1481
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,720
limited

1482
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,640
besides the basic reduction line of ring

1483
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,759
rb from prior works

1484
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,359
we can also show reductions of ringer

1485
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,480
with suprapoli modulus

1486
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,720
by the work of bpr2 and we can also show

1487
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,839
a reduction from search bring rb to

1488
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,319
a search ring availability.org of uh

1489
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,720
bogdanov gold messily richardson and

1490
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,040
rosen in

1491
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:42,640
2016 but there are two main open

1492
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,799
questions in the ring setting compared

1493
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,799
with playing other players

1494
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,559
on the one hand we don't know the

1495
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,920
pseudo-randomness of ringer

1496
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,400
which is poorly modulus on the other

1497
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,040
hand

1498
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,680
um the harness of a ringer or mojo

1499
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,960
edward

1500
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,359
which leaky secret is to be determined

1501
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,400
uh finally uh at least to point out that

1502
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,480
a superpoli

1503
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,079
modulus suffers worse efficiency and a

1504
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,200
weaker security compared with poly

1505
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,040
modulus

1506
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,240
so it is important to determine the

1507
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,680
highest results

1508
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,558
of foreign modular

1509
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,680
and our work exactly answers uh the two

1510
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,960
questions

1511
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,279
okay so let me just state our results

1512
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,960
we first introduced a new framework of

1513
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,079
algebraic lwr

1514
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,559
in this framework we consider a random

1515
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,720
procedure wrongly according basis

1516
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,680
which is more flexible than original

1517
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,879
ranking

1518
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,240
according coefficient batting we also

1519
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,440
define a framework

1520
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,919
called the legislature which is inspired

1521
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,160
by the work of piker and pepin in 2019

1522
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,079
and it encompasses various algebraically

1523
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,160
structured errors such as

1524
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:54,720
ringer order poli mojo edible and more

1525
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,440
an issue that harness of ringer implies

1526
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,558
harness of

1527
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,880
others so from this we can focus on the

1528
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,200
harness of ringer

1529
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,079
then we show a reduction from search to

1530
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,279
decision ring other with poly modulus

1531
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,200
finally we show that the heart we showed

1532
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,160
the harness of ring and mojo at

1533
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,118
under leakage for ringer we proposed an

1534
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,920
attack for it

1535
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,599
under certain leaky scenario and this

1536
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,680
idea is similar to that of

1537
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,119
blockers to that the work of

1538
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,879
broadcasting at all

1539
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,079
and for mojo a ratio reduction from

1540
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,400
decision wringer b

1541
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,319
to decision module ring out even with

1542
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,160
leakage

1543
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,400
okay let's already introduce our main

1544
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,920
techniques so let me

1545
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,079
sketch those to the render mixture of

1546
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,160
ring as well the target

1547
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,440
is to show the reduction from search

1548
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,240
bring up to

1549
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,240
a decision ring out the bra at high

1550
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,558
level uh fighting the secret s is

1551
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,479
equivalent to fighting coefficients of s

1552
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:58,240
under bases and our technicals

1553
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,240
are similar to that of lpr10

1554
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,160
uh we choose the randomness of a ring at

1555
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,919
least

1556
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,160
and our reduction path is that as

1557
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,480
follows a step one shows if

1558
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,640
a search ring otherwise hard the

1559
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,920
immediate search problem pi ring at the

1560
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,879
back is also hard

1561
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,880
where the pi is uh the prime idea

1562
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,359
and step two issues a reduction from pi

1563
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,040
ring otherwise to an immediate worst

1564
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,839
case decision problem

1565
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,480
during other supply and step three

1566
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,799
issues

1567
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,480
the reduction from the ring i'll bring

1568
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,119
other cluster by to the error keys

1569
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,079
problem

1570
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,200
decision ring as well step two and three

1571
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,960
are similar to

1572
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,759
lpr term the key observation is

1573
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,119
in step one uh we require the uh

1574
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,520
automotive systems

1575
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,880
or galway group somehow communicate uh

1576
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,559
with ranking

1577
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,680
uh relate related to certain basis

1578
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,960
and we find uh ranking with respect to

1579
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,919
the so-called lawmaker basis is what we

1580
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,559
need

1581
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,400
we know that uh the widely used segment

1582
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,359
ring with power of two degree

1583
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,480
is with no non non-integral basis but we

1584
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,598
can start define

1585
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,440
a running procedure to achieve this

1586
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,280
and we also remarked that leo duca also

1587
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,960
provides some insightful requirements

1588
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,040
for choosing basis

1589
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,000
so it is very interesting to determine

1590
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,480
more business

1591
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,520
satisfying our requirements for mojo

1592
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:31,119
with leaky secret we generate the

1593
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,880
uh the work of uh oil and cream pizza

1594
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,839
and week's

1595
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,359
approach to the arena set which shows a

1596
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:40,400
reduction for planet earth

1597
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:42,319
with leakage similar to akpw

1598
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,680
we can define the lossy simpler over

1599
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,839
rings and

1600
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,759
the computational indistinguishability

1601
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,040
of step one relates on the ring of

1602
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,920
reassuration

1603
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,720
another uh running of atl time death

1604
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,359
preserves

1605
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,839
a love interview of s if the work

1606
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,759
dimension k is large

1607
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:02,240
but the main barrier is that there is

1608
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,440
low ring leftover dilemma

1609
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:08,240
for general ring of integers

1610
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,720
uh we finally get rid of this battery by

1611
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,040
showing a ring level overhammer here

1612
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,759
the statement of our lemma is a little

1613
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,000
involved

1614
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:20,160
here we can apply it to concrete cases

1615
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,640
from our lemma we know that for a

1616
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,040
general ring of integers

1617
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,799
uh the statistical distance between the

1618
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,839
pair of ring vector a

1619
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,559
the inner product of a small qr and the

1620
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:35,920
random pair is bounded by website

1621
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:38,720
whereas the secrets mod any ideal factor

1622
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,480
q has elapsed entropy and the fourth

1623
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,759
segment atomic ring the entropy

1624
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,040
requirement of s can be weakened and if

1625
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,160
we consider the

1626
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,759
ideal qr with large ideal factor

1627
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,558
the entropy of s molecule can be smaller

1628
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,559
okay thank you

1629
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,400
thank you

1630
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,399
are there any questions we have maybe

1631
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,760
time for a few

1632
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,880
or uh not right now

1633
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:13,200
um not yet okay

1634
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,960
so it works

1635
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,720
but i don't know if you think that some

1636
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,079
of the earlier questions are worth going

1637
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,200
back to if uh

1638
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:24,960
well there's now a question um

1639
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:28,078
two actually um one by yangyuu

1640
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,520
is asking does your reduction give an

1641
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,200
attack to search

1642
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:36,400
uh rlwr in which q is not a multiple of

1643
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:39,598
p yes

1644
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,799
yeah exactly

1645
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,520
okay that should answer the question i

1646
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,599
think

1647
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,640
uh very straightforward uh rachel player

1648
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,319
is asking does a

1649
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,319
search to decision reduction for ring or

1650
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,520
wr apply for parameter settings of

1651
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:55,119
practical interest

1652
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,480
such as p and q both powers of two

1653
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,200
uh p and q will be power of two

1654
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,799
yeah both the powers of two that's a

1655
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,598
decision reduction

1656
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,079
um you know applied to it yeah yeah yes

1657
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,839
we can

1658
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,280
we can uh we can also define the ranking

1659
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:13,759
we

1660
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,280
no no no no p q be the power to we

1661
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,799
consider the

1662
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,559
uh that the ring dimension m is p

1663
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:25,520
uh the power of uh power power of two

1664
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,880
and uh in this case um in this case the

1665
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,160
second omega is which is

1666
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,680
low uh normally integral basis but we

1667
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,480
can uh

1668
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,879
we can define the ranking uh to this

1669
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,400
case

1670
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:41,680
uh another uh we need

1671
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,440
uh there some tricky uh we we need to

1672
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,799
define the wrong

1673
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,079
with respect to the absolute value

1674
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,079
um okay

1675
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,839
okay yeah so if there are any more

1676
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,200
questions i encourage the authors to

1677
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,720
head over to zulip and

1678
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,480
uh answer them or answer them in more

1679
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,399
