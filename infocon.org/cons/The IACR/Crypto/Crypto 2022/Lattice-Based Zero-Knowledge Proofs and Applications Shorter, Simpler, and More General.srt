00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,800
hi everyone my name is khan i work at

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,279
ibm research europe zurich

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,240
and i'm going to talk about

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,759
lattice-based zero knowledge proofs and

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
applications shorter simpler and more

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,200
general

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,480
so this is joint work with vadim

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,920
lubaszewski and maxim planzo

crypto 2022

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,960
straight from zurich

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
let's get it

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
listen yeah i got 99 problems but zero

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
knowledge ain't one justifying efficient

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,760
simulator to run master coefficients i

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
don't mean mp2 do rejection assembly and

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,039
the verifier has no clue the protocol is

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
so easy just like playing chess but

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,840
proof size so small made my mind impress

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
sometimes i feel like i'm young and cool

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
because my age was the process i would

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
be in high school

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
on the track better tell your friends yo

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
we break the charts with the laptop on

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,479
the weekend even if you're not a fan

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
i'll extract the likes and tall normal

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
time just as breaking side i got even

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
funnier lines in the full version of the

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
song have a deadline to work on so i

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
won't stay low are there some questions

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,560
stand in the line if i cannot answer

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,280
let's take it offline

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,560
[Music]

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
proof is so small that it fits on a

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,000
fluffy this correctness so easy as abc

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
it's like putting mint in a cup of tea

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
statement so exactly you think where is

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
the hack

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
verifier is convinced with no slack

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,119
there's a sound

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
transcript you can't learn with no error

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,200
protocol is the adversary's worst fear

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
he finds himself alone like he's been

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,159
through time

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
to wait for only prince iacr since the

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
update i gave upon google's color the

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,440
last things i read

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
are essays is calling for real i can say

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,120
and you think the protocol is slow

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
that's untrue implementation is no

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
challenge

53

[Music]

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
it's time for some technical overview

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
take a cycle atomic ring and call it rq

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
combine i tie with bdlop to obtain a

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
short commitment are you still with me

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,519
don't worry about the sounds don't

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
repeat a lot this protocol like johnson

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
is one show yeah message of the song is

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
loud and clear i don't even need to rap

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
i just fiat shamir

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
if you made an album it would be a short

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
basis have a world tour and go in

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,519
different places starting at ucsb maybe

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
ram session but that's for later now

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
it's my presentation hope your speakers

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,920
ready cause this song special sound

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
gotta go cause my time just reached the

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
upper bound that's the end of my slides

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
still love the projector now going to

72
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,000
the top is my shortest vector letters

79

much for watching
