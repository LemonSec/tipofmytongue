hi

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,520
i am dorine riepel and i will give you a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,160
brief overview of our new paper password

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
authenticated key exchange from group

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,599
actions

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,519
this is joint work with michelle

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
abdullah torsten eisenhofer ike kilz and

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
sabrina kunzweiler

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
at the same time you can follow our chat

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
and read a bit more about the story

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
behind the paper

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
so let's start

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
we use group actions as a building block

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,560
and more concretely the framework of

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
cryptographic roof group actions which

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
is an abstraction that is very close to

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
the classical diffie-hellman setting

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
various constructions were already

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
proposed for example public key

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
encryption signatures and oblivious

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
transfer

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,039
the most interesting instantiation of

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
group actions is given by the

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,840
commutative super singular isotony div

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
helmet protocol or short seaside

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
which is believed to be post quantum

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
secure

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
so the final goal is to construct a

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
password authenticated key exchange

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,479
protocol or short peak

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,119
such a protocol allows two parties to

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,840
agree on a session key based only on the

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
knowledge of a short low entropy string

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
for example a password

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,400
so here we have alice and bob who both

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
know the password

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
and after they exchanged some messages

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,600
they will be able to compute a shared

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
session key

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
when we talk about security of pake we

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
consider an adversary mallory who might

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
try to impersonate bob towards alice

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
of course mallory can always guess a

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,079
password then interact with alice and

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
see if the guess was correct

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
this is what we call an online

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
dictionary attack and this should be the

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
best attack against each page protocol

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
since password are basically used

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
everywhere pig is a nice tool for

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
practical applications

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
after an official selection process by

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
this the cfrg two protocols will now

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
also be standardized

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
one of the winners cpace builds upon the

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
simple password exponential key exchange

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
short speak

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
which is also our starting point

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
in speak the two parties perform a

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
diffie-hellman key exchange where the

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,879
password is used to hash

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,440
to a generator of the group

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
unfortunately this approach does not

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
work in the seaside setting since we

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,760
don't know how to hash into super single

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
eye sargony graphs

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
so our next idea was to use a bit a bit

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
by bit approach using a crs of two

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
elements

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
each bit of the password would then

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,200
determine which crs element will be used

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
for a group action diffie-hellman key

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
exchange

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
however it turns out that this is also

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
insufficient and this is due to the fact

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
that the elliptic curves used in seaside

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,640
provide additional structure namely the

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,200
twists

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
using twists one can break the

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
assumption underlying our protocol and

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
it also directly translates to an

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,519
offline dictionary attack

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,239
in our paper we finally present two

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
different protocols which both solve

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
this issue

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
the first uses a commitment so that the

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,080
party sending the first message needs to

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,319
choose the message in advance and commit

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
to it

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,640
so that the other party cannot use this

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
information to perform the attack we

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,760
identified before

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
in the second protocol both parties

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
compute different combinations or cross

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
terms of the diffie-hellman values

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
which ensures that they really need to

97
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
know the secret

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
we prove security of the first protocol

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
based on the gap cdh assumption for

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,519
group actions

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
and the second uses a new assumption

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
which we call strong square inverse

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
diffie-hellman

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
one advantage of this is that the

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,560
protocol can still be executed in one

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
round

107
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
we also show how to optimize the

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,880
protocols so that they are significantly

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
more efficient than the only known

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,440
previous constructions for seaside

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,800
which use oblivious transfer

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
if you want to know more details about

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
our new protocols i'll give a longer

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
talk at crypto on tuesday or just have a

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
look at the eprint version of our paper

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,199
finally i also want to thank luca defeo

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,080
for the pun with the twists
