my name is alexis corb and i will be

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,880
presenting our paper on beyond the cesar

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,799
corner bound best possible wiretap

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,960
coding via obfuscation this is joint

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
work with evolishai paul liu and amit

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,280
zahi

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,120
we first defined the wiretap channel

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,640
which was first introduced by winer in

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,160
1975.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
in this model alice wishes to send a

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
message m to bob by sending an encoding

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
of m across bob's channel channel b

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,720
however there exists an eavesdropper eve

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
who receives the encoding of m across a

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
separate eavesdropping channel channel e

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,640
alice's goal is to encode the message in

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
such a way that bob can decode it but

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,040
eve cannot

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
in this work we considered the case for

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
channel b and channel e are both

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
discrete memory list channels

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
by this we mean that each channel can be

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,239
viewed as a function which maps each

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
input symbol to each output symbol with

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,079
some fixed probability determined by the

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,120
channel

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320
inputs set into the channel are

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
independently mapped to output symbols

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
based on these probabilities

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,600
we are also in the non-interactive

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,359
setting meaning that bob cannot send

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
messages back to alice and we assume

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
that alice and bob have no prepared

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,399
shared secrets ahead of time

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
to build intuition for this problem we

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
begin by showing a simple impossibility

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
result if each channel can be used to

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840
perfectly simulate bob's channel then

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,759
secure wiretap coding schemes must be

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
impossible since eve can essentially

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
learn everything that bob can learn

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
thus bob would have no advantage over

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,280
eve and we cannot send messages to bob

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
without ignoring them

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,400
we can characterize this by saying that

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
channel b is a degradation of channel e

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
if there exists some other channel

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
channel s such that channel b can be

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
written as the concatenation of channel

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
e with channel s

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,759
thus whenever this is the case we cannot

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
build a secure wiretap coding scheme

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
in light of this we ask whether it is

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
possible to create a secure wiretap

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
coding scheme whenever this is not the

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,040
case more precisely can we create a

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
wiretap coding scheme whenever channel b

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,399
is not a degradation of channel e

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
unfortunately in the information

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
theoretic setting this answer is no

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
cesarean corner showed that wiretap

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,079
coding schemes are possible if and only

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
if channel e is not less noisy than

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,520
channel b

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,959
this is a stronger requirement than

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
degradation

67
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
to illustrate this consider the scenario

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
where bob's channel is a binary

69
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
symmetric channel which flips each bit

70
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,959
with some probability p

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,319
and where each channel is a binary

72
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
erasure channel which erases each bit

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,319
with some probability epsilon

74
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
in this case the entire blue area of the

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,160
graph on the right represents the set of

76
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
channels that satisfy the less noisy

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,879
requirement

78
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,239
and thus cannot be used to build a

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,840
secure wiretap coding scheme in the

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
information theoretic setting but they

81
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
are not degraded with respect to each

82
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,560
other

83
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
as an example of a channel in this blue

84
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
region consider the case where bob's

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
channels at bse will flip probability 10

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
observe that if eve's ratio channel has

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
an erasure probability of 20

88
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
then eve can perfectly simulate bob's

89
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,800
channel by simply flipping each erase

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
bit to a random value

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,519
this would yield a string of

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
approximately 10 bit flips just like the

93
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
output of bob's channel

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,840
thus a 10 bsc is a degradation of a 20

95
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
bec however if the ratio probability

96
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
increases to thirty percent and eve

97
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
cannot simulate bob's channel as the

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
best she can do is to flip each erasure

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
to a random bit which instead yields a

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,519
string for approximately fifteen percent

101
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,640
big flips

102
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
so is the example of a bsc with 10

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
percent flip probability is not a

104
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
degradation of a bec with 30 a ratio

105
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
probability

106
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
seeing as these channels have been very

107
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
well characterized in the information

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
theoretic setting we can ask a very

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,319
natural question which is can we do

110
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,519
better in the computational setting

111
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
historically computational assumptions

112
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
have allowed us to get much better

113
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
results in many areas of crypto

114
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
including secure encryption and mpc

115
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
among many others but despite the fact

116
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,319
that wiretap channels have been studied

117
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
for decades since 1975 through our

118
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
knowledge there has been no other work

119
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
that studies feasibility results for

120
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
these channels in the computational

121
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,518
setting

122
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
we now return to our original question

123
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,680
but this time in the computational

124
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,640
setting

125
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
we ask can we create a wiretap coding

126
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
scheme whenever channel b is not a

127
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
degradation of channel e

128
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
and recall that our simple impossibility

129
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
holds even the computational setting

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
well in our work we show that yes

131
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
assuming a form of secure evasive

132
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
function obfuscation we can build

133
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
wiretap coding schemes if and only if

134
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
channel b is not a degradation of

135
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,918
channel e

136
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
this greatly extends the feasibility

137
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,520
region compared to information theoretic

138
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
setting in fact the best possible

139
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
feasibility region that we could hope

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
for

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
alternatively our work can be viewed in

142
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
the ideal obfuscation model in which

143
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
case our scheme is unconditionally

144
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
secure against unbounded adversaries who

145
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
can make only polynomially many queries

146
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
to the obfuscated function

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
to see how we achieve this please tune

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
in to our crypto talk for more details

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
thank you
