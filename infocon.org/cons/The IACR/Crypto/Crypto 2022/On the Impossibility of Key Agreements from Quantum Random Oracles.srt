1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,439
i'll be talking about on the

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,439
impossibility of key agreements from

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,120
quantum render oracles

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,640
this is a joint work with prayer

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
austrian kaimin chong hao chong shunfu

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,080
and the mohammad mahmudi i'm yao ting

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
ling

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
in the classical world we can do lots of

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
things with render oracles

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
it is collision resistant and one way

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,920
and you will give us private key

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
cryptography

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,080
but there is an interesting question

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,840
can we get key agreements from the

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,519
oracles key agreement is a two-party

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,920
interactive protocol

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
and alice and bob's goal is to share a

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
secret key against eavesdropper

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
they'll start with private local

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
randomness

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,039
and they can talk to each other

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
and finally they'll output their own

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
keys

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
and we say a key agreement protocol is

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,079
with perfect complainants if alice and

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
bob always output the same key

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,800
in the 70s merkel proposed the first

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
non-trivial key agreement protocol from

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,640
render oracles

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
so suppose alice and bob make the

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,720
credits to run the oracle

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
then every if dropper

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
need at least these square queries to

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
break the key

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
the seminal work of impergliazo and

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
rudis answer the question

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
they show that we cannot use random

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
oracles to get key agreements

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
and they prove it by constructing a

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,759
query efficient attack for every key

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
agreement protocols

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
the results have the following

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,119
implications to playback separations

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,600
it says that using one-way functions

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
will not suffice for a key agreement in

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
a black box way

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
later barak and mammootty shows that

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,159
merkel's puzzle is indeed optimal

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
but what if we allow the parties to use

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
quantum computation

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
if we allow content communication

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,200
then

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
you will give us unconditional secure

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
key agreements due to the bb 84 protocol

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
but what if the communication is still

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
classical

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
so we would like to ask the following

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
question

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
can quantum computation a random oracle

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,879
and the classical communication together

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,680
give us key agreements

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
the quantum and the oracle model was

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
proposed by bonnet l

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
is a regular render oracle that can be

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,959
queried in superposition

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
and if the random oracle model is the

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
only assumption

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,959
the tax efficiency is measured by the

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,360
number of queries

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
and such an attack is sufficient for

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
obtaining playback separations

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,000
so here here is our main question

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
can we have the quantum impact

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
algorithms result

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
jose almata and the yamakawa proposed

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,080
the following question

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
in their best paper were the winning

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
work

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
does there exist a key agreement where

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,519
else and bob can only do classical

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
communication but perform local quantum

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,879
computation and make quantum queries to

83
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,319
run the oracle

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,319
but every if dropper need a super

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
polynomial number of queries to find the

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,239
key

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
so here is our first result

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
is a symmetric setting whereas is

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
classical and bob is quantum

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,879
and we show that we can break every key

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,959
agreement with perfect completeness in

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
this setting

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
and the query complexity of if will be d

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
squared

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,920
next

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
we show that we can conditionally break

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
every key agreement with perfect

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
completeness

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
where alice and bob are both quantum

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,319
we propose a perimeter's conjecture

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,760
about low degree low influence

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
polynomials

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
which would imply a polyquery attack

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
and then we are able to prove the

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
conjuncture with exponentially small

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
influences

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
this will imply that we can break every

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
key agreement with perfect completeness

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
between quantum alice and quantum bob

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,040
who both make a constant number of

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
queries

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
since our attack only makes classical

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
queries

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
we want to study whether we can extend

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
our attack

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
into the imperfect complaining setting

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,440
but we have the following barrier result

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
it says that if the famous errands

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
abundance conjecture is false

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,080
then there exists a key agreement with

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
imperfect complainants against classical

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
eavesdropper

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
so if we want to obtain separations for

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
key agreements with imperfect

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
completeness

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
then we have to either prove a

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
conjecture

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
or construct an attack

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,280
that makes quantum queries

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,800
and our attack

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
was inspired by the ideas from the

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
compressed oracle technique by zandry

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
and we extend the learning epsilon heavy

134
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
query attacked by barack and mahmoud

135
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,800
through the quantum setting
