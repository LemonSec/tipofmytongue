hello everyone my name is taiga hiroka

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,319
in this talk i talk about satisfy the

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,240
virus in xero knowledge project ma

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,639
in this talk i'll consider the knowledge

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,559
project qma

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,640
here roughly speaking

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
q a is a quantum version of np in the

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,359
zero knowledge project

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,800
the following three properties hold

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
the first property is completeness

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
this guarantees that when the instance x

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,558
is this instance

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
the verifier accepts its high

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,719
probability

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
the second property is statistical

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
soundness

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
this guarantees that when the instance x

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
is not yes instance

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
the verifier rejects with high

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
probability

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
or any unbounded muscle spreader

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,199
that tries to make the verifier accept

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
the third property is zero knowledge

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
this guarantees that any minus specifier

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
learns nothing beyond the fact that the

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
instance x is this instance

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,799
when the verifier is computationally

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
bounded

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
we call the node's property

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
computational zero knowledge

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
however computational knowledge has risk

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,280
that the new algorithm

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
or improvement of computers may solve

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
the problem underlying the security of

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
computational zero knowledge

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
so the computational zero knowledge does

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,799
not necessarily guarantee long-term

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
security

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,799
in other words

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
in computational knowledge

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,799
the master specifier

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,759
may obtain information beyond the fact

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
that the instance x is this instance in

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
the future

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,840
this is undesirable

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
one way to resolve the problem is

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
to use protocol with statistical zero

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
knowledge

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
in the statistical zero knowledge the

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,679
security holds against unbounded mass

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,720
specified by fire

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
so the security will never break in the

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
future

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
however it is believed that we can't

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
construct a protocol

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
with statistical soundness and

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
statistical zero knowledge at the same

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
time

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
so if the protocol satisfies statistical

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
soundness

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
the knowledge property must be

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
computational

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
so our question is as well

64
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
can we construct the notes project ma

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
where the xenos property holds in a long

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
time

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,319
without compromising statistical

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,840
soundness

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
note that this question was first raised

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
by broadband and islam

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
in our work we resolve this question

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,319
affirmatively

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,519
for that first we introduce a new notion

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
of the knowledge property which we call

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,239
satisfatable signal knowledge

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
and then construct the noise plural qma

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
with statistical sentence and start for

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
developing the knowledge

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
now i will exponentiate the definition

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,720
of certifiable single knowledge

81
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,959
in the certified evolutionary knowledge

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,120
the mystery specifier can issue a

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
certificate

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
which shows that he deletes the

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
information received from the approval

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
then the priority can check whether the

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
certificate is valid or not using

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
internal information

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,159
when the certificate is valid

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
even if it's computing power becomes

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
unbounded after that

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,799
digit of the information

93
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
beyond the fact that the instance x is

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
this instance

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
this is an integral definition of

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
certifiable signal knowledge

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
so in the certified devoting their

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
knowledge the security will never break

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
in the future

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
when the certificate is buried

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
note that such party embarrassing their

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
knowledge does not guarantee any

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,360
security

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
when the certificate is not buried

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
however the private can prevent the

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
verifier from refusing to output the

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,800
valid certificate by polarizing the much

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
spare higher

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
so

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
so we believe that this security is

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
streaming

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
now i finished this short talk

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
if you are interested in our results

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
please come to see my talk thank you

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,359
harassing
