00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,199
hi welcome to video abstract for our

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,759
paper overloading the nodes rocked

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
rprp's non-set iad and order resilient

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,240
channels

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
this is a joint work of my advisor

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
jean-paul de gabriel and myself

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,680
we start by introducing a new security

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
notion for variable input length

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
tweakable ciphers mapping a pair of

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
strings to a pair of strings

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,840
we call this new notion rock

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
pseudorandom permutation or rprp for

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,679
short

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,238
the rprp notion lies right in between

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,960
the prp notion where the adversary is

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,000
tasked

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
with distinguishing between

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
equal cipher and ideal cipher

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
given full access to the n ciphering

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
algorithm and the sprp notion where the

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
university has the same task

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
but in addition has full access to the

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,719
deciphering algorithm

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
in the rprp game

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
the adversary has the same task and is

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
given full access and ciphering but only

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
partial access to the deciphering

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
algorithm

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
we show how to construct efficient rprps

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
by presenting the uav construction

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
which consists only of two equal block

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,759
cipher and variable output length prf

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
as i said our prps are a notion built

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
for variable input length to equal

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,080
ciphers which one can use

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,280
to construct aad schemes using the

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
encode then inside for paradigm

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
since our prps are weaker primitive than

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,560
sprps we can use them to build

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,840
aud schemes more

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,600
efficiently first of such schemes we

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,119
present is the

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
encoding and cipher scheme which you can

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
see on the screen

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
if the underlying tweakable cipher is a

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
rprp

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
et scheme will be misused resistant

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
secure

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
since rbrp is

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
an asymmetric notion we also explored

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
the option of the encryption using the

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
deciphering algorithm and decryption

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
using the in cyphering algorithm

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
so we arrived at the encoding d cipher

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,239
construction

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,560
it turns out

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,840
the underlying tweakula cipher is ar prp

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
egd scheme will be

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
secure against release of unverified

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
plaintext

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
we consider the following variant of the

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,720
ete construction running one encrypts

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
the nonce during the encryption and

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
during the decryption use the nonce

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
provided to the decryption algorithm

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,080
as a redundancy for the authenticity

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
check

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
that gave rise

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
to a new different aud priority we call

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,879
the non-set aad where instead of a

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
single nouns

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
a non-set is provided

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,200
to the decryption algorithm and one text

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,040
if the decrypted nonce is in the

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,760
provided nonset

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
in comparison to conventional non-based

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
aed syntax

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
non-set aad decryption algorithm returns

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
announced message pair if the

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
description was

81
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,159
successful the non-set aad syntax proves

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
useful in the setting of network

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
protocols that run over unreliable

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
transport such as dtls or quick where

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
the nonset roughly corresponds to the

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,519
window mechanism of those protocols

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,200
finally we present a generic

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
construction

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
that transforms any non-set aed to a

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
secure channel that can have many

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
desired channel functionalities for

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
example protecting against replays

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
deciding how much

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
reordering to tolerate etc

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
this construction is much simpler to

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,840
understand and analyze than for example

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
quick and can be adapted to any required

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
functionality

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
for any of these functionalities the

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,840
security of the channel is guaranteed by

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
the security of the underlying non-aed

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,239
schemes

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
thank you we hope to see you in the live

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,280
version of our talk
