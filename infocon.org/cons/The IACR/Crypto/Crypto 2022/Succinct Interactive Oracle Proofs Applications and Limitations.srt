hi

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,440
my name is sufi nastar and today i will

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,120
be talking about succinct interactive

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,040
oracle proofs applications and

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,400
limitations

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
this is a joint work with ron rockbloom

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
so let's start by breaking down the

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,880
title what are interactive oracle proofs

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
or iops in short well iops are a new

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,760
type of proof system that generalizes

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
both traditional interactive proofs and

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,519
pcps

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,519
how does it work well we can think of it

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,199
as an interactive proof where the

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
verifier only gets oracle access to the

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
prover messages rather than the full

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
access that it gets in a traditional

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
interactive group

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
alternatively we can think of it as an

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
interactive analog of a pcp so a pcp is

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
basically a half a around iop

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,000
so what are iops good for well

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,079
iops have numerous applications from

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
constructing succinct arguments to

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,320
delegation of computation and even more

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
recently they've been used for achieving

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
hardness of approximation results so

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,239
iops are useful they have many

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,760
applications

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
but let's go back to the first word that

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
i had in the title which is succinct

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,760
what do we mean by succinct

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
well a succinct proof is essentially a

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
short proof

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,119
namely when we're talking about np

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
relations

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
a succinct proof is a proof whose length

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
is polynomial and the witness length

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
rather than in the instance length

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,799
why do we care about that well for

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
general np relations

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
usually the instance is much larger than

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,479
the witness so if we have a succinct

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,400
proof this means that we have a short

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
proof

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
calyandra is asked whether there exists

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
a succinct pcp for all of np

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,960
fortnite and sentinel basically gave a

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
negative answer for that question

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
because they showed that under a

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
standard complexity assumption there's

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
no succinct pcp for sat

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
however

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
we know that there exists a succinct iop

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,159
for sat in fact we know a couple of

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
constructions so this creates this sort

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
of separation between iops and pcps

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,680
and iop can do something that we believe

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
a pcp cannot

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,079
now let's go back to the succinct iop

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
for sat does that imply that there is a

62
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,038
succinct iop for all of np after all sat

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
is an np-complete relation

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,959
however this is not the case and this is

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,599
because reductions from np relations to

66
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,360
sat do not necessarily preserve the

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
witness length

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
so this question remains open whether

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
there exists a succinct iop for all of

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
np

71
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
now one might ask why do we care about

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
that why do we care about succinct iops

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
and as a first result we show an

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
application of sex entire piece

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
we show a compiler that takes a succinct

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,040
iop and produces a succinct zero

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,879
knowledge proof and i want to emphasize

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
that we're talking about proofs here so

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
we have statistical soundness

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,959
so sound is holds even against an

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
unbounded cheating prover this is not an

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
argument

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
and this compiler requires only the

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
minimal assumption of one wave functions

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
so we take this compiler and we apply it

86
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
to the succinct iop of run c and

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
rotbloom and we get the shortest known

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,800
zero knowledge proofs for bounded space

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
np relations under the minimal

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
assumption of one-way functions

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,239
namely the zero-knowledge proof that we

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
get has a communication complexity or

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
proof length which approaches the

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
original witness

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
now this is cool succinct iops implies

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,560
succinct zero-knowledge proofs so can we

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
get this extinct iop for all of np so

98
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,239
we're revisiting the question that we

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,799
asked earlier and as a second result we

100
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
show that under a new but reasonable

101
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
complexity conjecture there is no

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
succinct iop for all of np

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
how do we do that well at the first step

104
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
we show a compiler that takes a succinct

105
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
iop and produces a special sort of

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,680
algorithm which is a small space

107
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
algorithm with polynomial time

108
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
preprocessing

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,799
we conjecture that circuit sat cannot be

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
solved in small space with polynomial

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
time pre-processing now circuit stat is

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
the boolean satisfiability problem of

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,799
circuits rather than just specific

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
formulas

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
so combining the conjecture with the

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,080
compiler we get that under this

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
conjecture there's no succinct iop for

118
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,319
csat or more generally there's no

119
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
succinct iop for all of np

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
for more details you are more than

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
welcome to attend the talk that i will

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
be giving at the conference thank you
