00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone i'm jolyan i'm here to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,040
give a short overview of our results and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
now manipulate your knowledge this is

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,880
john's work with alan kim and ankan

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
pandi

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,400
let's first briefly recall the

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
definition for knowledgeable commitments

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
and knowledge about zero knowledge

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
for nominal commitments we consider the

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
so-called mind in the middle execution

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,039
in this execution there is an adversary

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
we denote it as m

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
in the left execution an honest

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
committer commits to m

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
and in the red execution

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,640
this addrem plays the role of a

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
committer committing to some message to

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
the receiver r

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
what numerable equipment want to achieve

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
is that the value committed by this

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,320
adversary m

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
in the red session should be independent

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
of the value committed by the honest

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
committer c in the left session

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
to capture this requirement i first need

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
to define two important random variables

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
the first variable is the view of the

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,039
main middle address right um

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
the other one is amp tutor which is the

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
value committed in the real execution by

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
the mayan middle addition

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
in this beam execution

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
we concern the joint distribution of

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
these two variables

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
now we compare this real world with a

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
simulated world

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
where the honest receiver is talking to

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,479
a simulator

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,479
this setting is a little bit different

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
from a zero knowledge definition in that

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,840
the simulator cannot rewind the receiver

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
r

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
because r is an honest receiver

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,640
however the simulator can join the minor

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
middle adversary internally and

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
potentially revives him

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
the simulator is required to be

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,079
efficient

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,799
and importantly he doesn't know the

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,439
value m committed in the real game by

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
the left honest meter

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
at the end of the simulated world the

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
simulator output a tuple

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
and we say that a commitment scheme is

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
not measurable if these two tuples are

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,319
computationally indistinguishable

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
here the intuition is that in this

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,239
simulated world the simulator managed to

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,400
simulate the view of the minor middle

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,319
together with the value committed by the

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,720
main middle without knowing the honest

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
commuter's value m

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
therefore this intuitively implied that

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
the value committed by the main middle

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
should be independent of the value

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,239
committed by the honest committer

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,400
nominal zero knowledge can be defined in

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
a similar way we also consider the mayan

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,800
middle execution

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
but the minor middle adversary plays the

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
role of a verifier in the left

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
communication

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
in the red communication this adversary

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
plays the role of a potentially

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
malicious proverb

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
proving some statement to the red honest

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,800
verifier

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
similar to the numerable commitment the

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
goal here is to make sure that the main

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,239
middle adversary cannot prove statements

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
that he cannot prove originally

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
meaning without talking with this honest

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
verifier in the left

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
to capture this requirement

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
we look at the value output by the

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,000
honest verifier

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
this is the binary bit indicating if the

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
verifier accepts the adversary's proof

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,239
or not

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
now in the simulator board we again have

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
this simulator talking to the verifier

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
trying to prove the same statement

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
importantly this simulator doesn't know

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
the witness w and also he doesn't know

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
the witness for this executable

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
however the simulator is trying to make

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
the verifier output a bit b prime

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
which is supposed to be computationally

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
indistinguishable from very fast design

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
bit in the real world as you can see if

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,360
the simulator managed to do so

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
that means what the adversary did in the

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
real world can be done by a efficient

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
machine which is the simulator

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,439
without having the interaction with the

106
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
left honest approver

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,920
this is how we capture the requirement

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
written about

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
before talking about existing works i

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,478
want to mention that these two

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
primitives are very useful nominable

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
equipments are useful for reducing run

113
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
complexity of multiple decomposition

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,919
protocols

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
and non-metabolizer knowledge has helped

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
us obtain better concurrent secure

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
multiple decomposition

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
now let's take a look at what we know

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
about the constructions

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
in the theoretical set after a long line

121
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
of research we eventually have constant

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
round constructions from the minimal

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
assumption of wind functions

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,759
however in the real world the state of

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
the arts are less satisfactory

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
for nominal commitment there does exist

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,919
a efficient construction based on ddh

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,080
but for non-level zero knowledge there

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
are no reported implementations with

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
practical efficiency

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,960
in this work we present the first

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
non-metabolic knowledge protocol

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
achieving a real-world efficiency

134
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
our construction only makes use of

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,440
symmetric key assumptions and is in the

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
plane model meaning without any setup

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,320
our technique also implies the first

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
practical non-verbal commitment using

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,199
only symmetry key assumptions this is in

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
contrast to the bgrv protocol mentioned

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
earlier which is based on ddh assumption

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
this is all i want to share during this

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
short talk if you are interested please

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
look forward to our talk at full length

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
here is the related information you can

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,479
thank you for your attention
