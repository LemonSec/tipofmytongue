00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,720
hi everyone i'm ron rothblum and i

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,400
wanted to invite you to my talk on

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,759
building collision-resistant hash

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
functions from multi-collision resistant

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,679
hash functions so joint work with uh

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,519
prashant vasudevan

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
um so as you can guess by the title this

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,079
work is about hash functions

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,600
specifically collision-resistant hash

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,560
functions

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
so these are a very uh prominent and

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
widely studied notion in cryptography

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
it's basically hash functions that are

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
shrinking which means that there must be

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
a lot of collisions around but it is

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
computationally hard to find collisions

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
uh so it's a very useful and powerful

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,239
notion in crypto

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
um and in recent years there's been a

20
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
study of a relaxation of this notion

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,760
which is called multi-collision

22
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
resistant hash functions where for

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,160
example you could have a situation in

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
which maybe it's easy to find sort of

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
pairwise collisions but it's hard to

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
find three wise collisions okay so that

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,840
would be a three uh

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,039
three-way

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,440
three-way multi-collision resistant hash

30
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
functions and it's sort of a weaker

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
notion it seems to be a weaker notion

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
than collision-resistant hash functions

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
and in this work we actually show how to

34
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,720
transform

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,600
uh

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,880
in some settings

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
multi-collision-resistant hash functions

38
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,439
into collision-resistant hat functions

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,040
which i find to be

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
pretty surprising that it's possible to

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
do that and in particular the

42
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,600
construction

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,320
is pretty weird

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
in an interesting way

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,880
and

46
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
it

47
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
sort of one of the interesting aspects

48
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
is that it's non-black box

49
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,320
so

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
um

51
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
our the correlations resistant hash

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
function that we

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
end up constructing

54
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,799
is makes a non-black box use of the

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,640
collision resistant hash function

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
and it's also non-explicit in the sense

57
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
that if you tell me

58
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
you know here's a

59
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,159
an mcrh give me back a collision

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
resistance hash function i won't be able

61
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,759
to do that what i will be able to prove

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
to you is that a collision hash function

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
exists

64
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
but i can't really point out the

65
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,799
algorithm and if you'd like to uh hear

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
more about it and learn why we have

67
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
uh why it's non-constructive and

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,240
non-black box then you're more than

69
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,479
welcome to attend my talk at crypto so

70
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
see you there bye everyone
