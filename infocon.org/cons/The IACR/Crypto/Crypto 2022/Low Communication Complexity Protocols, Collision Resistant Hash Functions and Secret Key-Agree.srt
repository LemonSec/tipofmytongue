1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,600
low communication complexity protocols

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,839
collision resistant hash functions and

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,240
secretly agreement protocols

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
recall communication complexity where

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
the input is split between alice and bob

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
who have to compute some target function

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,760
with as little communication as possible

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
our example for a target function is the

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,880
equality predicate where alice and bob

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
have to figure out whether their inputs

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,599
are identical or not

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,920
anyway most of the results apply to

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
almost any predicate

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,600
there are some reasonable criteria

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
the central properties of communication

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
complexity models

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,760
are the network layout whether the

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,719
participants communicate directly

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
or with a third party

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,160
and whether there exists a common random

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,440
source

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
we are not considering here

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
deterministic protocols

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,960
in this short introduction we'll focus

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
on the simultaneous messages model

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,479
in this model alice and bob get their

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,600
inputs

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,560
and produce one message each

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
these messages are sent to a third party

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,759
a referee

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,960
who has to compute the target function

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,119
with some constant high probability

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
for this model with no common randomness

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,479
there is a known tight lower bound of

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,840
square root of n

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
that was proven several times

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
see the paper of bubba and kml for a

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
description

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
of a protocol that achieves

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,159
the lower bound

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
and references for more such protocols

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
our central question is

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
can the communication complexity be

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,520
reduced in a computational world

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,640
one motivation is to discuss techniques

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
closer to the

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,799
real world

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
we discuss two computational variations

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,439
the first is the preset randomness model

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
where there is

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
a common source of randomness but the

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
inputs are chosen by an adversary who

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,160
sees the common randomness also

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
the second model is the free talk model

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
that we will discuss later

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
in the preset randomness model

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
we show that breaking the known lower

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
bound implies

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
the existence of dcr range

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
distributional collision resistant hash

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
functions

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
dcrh is where only random collisions are

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
guaranteed to be hard to find

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
that is

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,360
we show explicitly how such a protocol

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
can be used

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
to construct a dcrh function

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
that's for the simultaneous messages

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
model

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
in the interactive model

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
we show a similar result for a different

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,840
bound

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,519
we also show

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,400
that

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
there are no protocols of constant

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
communication regardless of assumptions

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
we use techniques from baba and kim's

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
proof to show those results

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
note that

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,239
assuming collision resistant hash

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
functions regular

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,640
one can break the lower bound of a

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,319
square root of n easily

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
the second model

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
is the stateful free talk model in this

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
model alice and bob can communicate

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,360
freely

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,239
before the inputs are chosen then the

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,760
input are chosen by the adversary who

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
sees the their communication

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,440
and now the communication is measured

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
in this model we consider adversary with

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
more power

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
he

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
chooses the input for bob at the last

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
moment and also we can wait for an

97
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,839
opportunity to attack

98
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
in this model we show that protocols

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
that are both resilient to such a

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,480
powerful adversary

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
and also very efficient

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
where the error rule is exponentially

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
small in the communication

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
implied the existence of secret key

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
agreement protocols

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
a secret key agreement protocol is where

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
two parties with nothing in common

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
agree on a secret key such that any

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
adversary listening to the communication

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
is unable to know anything

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
about the agreed key

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
note that using a secret key agreement

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
protocol such protocols exist

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
and of course

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
even better

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,040
thank you
