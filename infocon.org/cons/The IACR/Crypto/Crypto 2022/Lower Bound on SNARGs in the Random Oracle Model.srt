00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,120
hi everyone my name is elon yogev this

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
is joint work with daniel nuka and iftar

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,279
height now so this talk is about low

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,360
bounds on snarls in the random walker

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
model so let me give you give you a

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,599
brief introduction so what are snags

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,200
with our succinct non-interactive

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,240
arguments in the analytical model so

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
this is a puller and a verifier where

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,320
pulver wants to convince the value file

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
that some instance is in the language so

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
he sends a single short message pi to

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
convince the verifier

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,560
and

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
they both have access to a totally

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
random function so this is the random

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
function this is a totally random

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,640
function that outputs lambda bits

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,360
and the security we have in this model

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,680
is security against query bounded

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
proverbs that even might be

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
computationally unbounded so more

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
formally we have t epsilon security

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
meaning that for any x not in the

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,440
language

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
any t query may be potentially unbounded

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
adversaries so this is an adversary that

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
performs at most t queries to the random

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
oracle

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,680
but other than that computationally can

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,400
be unbounded so for any such profile the

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
probability that this program outputs pi

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
that makes the verifier accept is at

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
most epsilon and epsilon can be a

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,799
function of t and lambda

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
so this is the the security definition

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,640
of snugs in the random oracle model

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
why do we study the random voltmeter

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,320
model so it's a very simple

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
information theoretic model talks about

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
probabilities of the market there's no

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
computational assumptions here

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
uh there's beautiful constructions that

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
we that we'll talk about

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
it actually supports low bound as the

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
stock suggested so we can probe

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
unconditional low bounds about

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
constructions

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,759
and finally you can take the arm

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
heuristic where you place the random

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
oracle with some specific lightweight

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
cryptographic health function for

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
example chapter 56 and what you get is a

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,079
candidate construction logistic

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
construction which is faster compute so

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,719
it doesn't involve all this heavy crypto

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,119
okay only on applying lightweight hash

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
function there's no trusted setup

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
and the construction you get is actually

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,639
a potentially post quantum secure

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,239
okay as we don't have any quantity

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,959
advantage over general hash functions

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
and this thing is actually widely used

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
in in practice

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
okay

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
so what constructions do we have

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
so we have the italian bcs construction

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,040
the mechanic is based on pcps and bcs is

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
based on

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
iops both of them take this information

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
theoretic proof and compile them to a

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,920
snug but the proof size in both of them

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
is the same so the proof side the size

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
of the snug that you need to center the

75
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
verifier is log t over electron squared

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
okay and here i'm hitting some lower

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
order terms okay and this whole tilde so

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
t is the running time of the cheating

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
pool and epsilon is its successful

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
ability

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
in a recent work with myself and

82
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
alexander kiev we actually show the

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
valiant of this construction that

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
achieves log t of electron times long t

85
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,519
okay so slightly sub quadratic

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
and if i put it on a scale then we have

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
the mikali we have the see cycy

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
construction and then we have a trivia

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,440
like folklore bound and locked over

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
epsilon but between these two this is

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
wide open

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
okay this leads us exactly to the result

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
of this paper which is um

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
actually the first non-trivial low bound

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
on snarls so assuming randomized zth

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
any natural

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
rom snug construction so any natural

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
construction i'm gonna talk about this

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,159
in a second okay that has t epsilon

100
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,200
soundness

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
must have a both sides of this so log t

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
over epsilon times log t

103
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
over log q where q is the is the running

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,560
time of the honest folder the number of

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,840
queries long

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
performs

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
okay so this is our main theorem uh i'll

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,680
already say that as a corollary okay you

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
get a low bound on subject or

110
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,519
commitments

111
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,720
okay so

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
similarly with the similar and natural

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,519
flavor so if you had a

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,879
subject or commitment in the random

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,640
occur model you would put it inside

116
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,239
mikali and get a

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,599
a small that contradicts this neuron

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
okay what a natural construction so

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
two requirements first it's a

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,560
non-adaptable a very file so this means

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,199
that the very file performs its queries

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
to the random oracle in a non-adaptive

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
manner okay it sends all the queries at

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
once and gets all the responses

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
and two some slightly stronger soundless

126
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
notion consulted soundness uh

127
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
where you're welcome to see the full

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,400
talk to understand exactly what this is

129
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,479
uh but the point is that all known

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
construction okay that we have actually

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
satisfy all naturally they satisfy this

132
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
condition these conditions

133
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
okay and just to put it on the final

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
slide so we provide the slow bound which

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
is almost tight with the the upper bound

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,360
of cy okay up to this login and local

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
factors

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
okay thank you and please go to see the

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,479
the fully talk
