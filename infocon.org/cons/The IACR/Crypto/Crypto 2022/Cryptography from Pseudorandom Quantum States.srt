00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,800
hello today i'd like to tell you about

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,279
constructing quantum cryptography from

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,440
pseudorandom quantum states and by

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,400
extension wormholes and this is joint

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,360
work with prabanjan anand and henry yen

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
appearing in crypto 2022.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
so in this abstract i would like to

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
start by asking the following question

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,519
take your favorite cryptography

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
um maybe aes sha-2 sha-3 rsa

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
lattices or even concrete schemes like

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
tls and you actually prove its concrete

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
security without any assumptions

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,160
um by

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
crypto research over the past few

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
decades now we know that any

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,480
unconditional security proof will

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,600
necessarily imply the existence of

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
this object called one-way functions

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
and thus this would settle the

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
million-dollar question regarding

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
whether p equals mp or not

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,879
however

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
this work combined with a prior work by

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760
kreshner last year we showed that there

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
are no such barriers for the proving

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,040
security for quantum cryptography

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
and this is also concurrent with another

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
work by morime and yamakawa

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
both of these works is going to be

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
appearing in crypto 2022

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
so if this sounds interesting to you

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,400
please come to our talk or read our

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
paper

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
so in a bit more detail

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,280
um krashma last year showed that unlike

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,479
classically

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
p equals mp does not rule out the

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
existence of quantum pseudorandomness in

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
the relativizing setting meaning that

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
there is a quantum oracle relative to

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
which p equals to mp but quantum

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
pseudorandomness exists in this work we

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
show that assuming the same flavor of

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
quantum pseudorandomness we can actually

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
use it to construct multiple useful

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
quantum cryptography including

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,799
commitment schemes and encryption themes

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
and furthermore we also show how to

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
instantiate existing transformation from

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
commitment to

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
quantum multi-party secure computation

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
protocols with our quantum commitment

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
schemes

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
and therefore we show how to go from

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,800
quantum signal randomness to quantum

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
secure multi-party computations

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
and as a corollary this shows that even

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
if p equals mp it does not necessarily

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,800
roll out the existence of quantum

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
cryptography unlike classically

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,239
so a bit more technically the

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,360
pseudo-randomness that we are

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
considering is called random state

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,599
generator or short sprs

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
which is an object introduced by glio

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
and song in 2018 which maps a lambda bit

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,160
c to an n qubit state and we show that

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
if the output length is a little bit

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
more than two log lambda then we can use

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
it to construct statistically binding

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
commandments

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
and if n is super logarithmic then we

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
can use it to construct one-time

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,040
encryption schemes for arbitrarily long

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
messages and the main technical insight

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
from our work is that we define a

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
pseudo-random function analog of prs

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
which we call pseudorandom function like

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
states or prfs for short

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
and we show how starting from prs we can

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
construct short import prfs which

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
suffices for constructing commitments

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
and encryptions

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
furthermore we also show how prfs in

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
general can also be plugged into

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
existing classical construction just

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,920
like prf classically

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
so to conclude let me talk about a few

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,319
candidate quantum pseudorandomness or

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
candidate prs constructions

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
one construction is observed or pointed

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,319
out by bull and peppermint and vadirani

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,280
in 2020 which shows that

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,360
warm flow dynamics actually give you a

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
way to instantiate quantum prs

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
another candidate is random quantum

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
circuits and this is also a good

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
candidate because there are a lot of

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
literature studying this object from

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
quantum supremacy and furthermore we

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
might hope that using this approach we

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,799
might even be able to come up with

104
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,920
quantum cryptography that is secure

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
against quantum adversary but also

106
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
implementable on near-term quantum

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,720
devices

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
with that i conclude this talk thank you

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,040
for your attention
