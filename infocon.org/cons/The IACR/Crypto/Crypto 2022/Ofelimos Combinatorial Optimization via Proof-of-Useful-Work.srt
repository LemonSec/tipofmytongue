00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
hi i'm euros from yutakus i'm a

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,919
researcher at input output global in

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
this video i'll talk about felimos a

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,759
provably secure proof of useful work

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,840
blockchain this is joint work with

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
matthias fizzy aguilas and alexander

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
russell the earliest and most widely

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,000
used blockchains such as bitcoin and

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
ethereum use hash-based proofs of work

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
this means that their security is based

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
on protocol participants searching for

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
small houses arguably a problem that is

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
not generally useful

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,558
in fact the more energy spend on

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,880
computing this pause the more costly it

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,239
is for malicious party to break the

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
security of the protocol

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
it is exactly for this reason that these

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
protocols have built in incentives for

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
increased energy consumption

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
for example in the form of block rewards

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
this design has led to the current level

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
of energy consumed by bitcoin to be

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
similar to that of a medium-sized

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,079
country

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
thus there is a problem with

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,039
proof-of-work blockchains in that they

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
incentivize a never increasing

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
expenditure of energy

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
just to maintain the security of the

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,559
protocol this problem was identified

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
early on by the blockchain community in

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,560
response a number of alternatives have

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
been proposed

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
one approach is trying to utilize

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
resources that are different from

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,520
computational work such as memory or

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,040
state

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,119
this results in protocols whose security

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,640
is based on different assumptions than

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,119
proof-of-work blockchains

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,960
a different proposal is instead of

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,560
trying to decrease the energy consumed

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
to try to repurpose it for other uses

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,159
the simplest way to do that is using the

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
block mining machines for hitting your

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,720
home

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,119
a more sophisticated approach is to have

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,720
miners compute proofs of useful work

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
that requires solving some externally

51
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,119
useful problem

52
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,960
for example there have been proposals

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
for solving problems in physics or

54
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,360
number theory or optimization

55
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
the useful work direction has proven to

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
be quite challenging with most of

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
previous work suffering from one of the

58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,920
three following problems

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
first that the work performed is not

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
broadly useful for example in primecoin

61
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,119
a well-known protocol minor search for

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
change of prime numbers

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
secondly that there is no formal

64
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,639
security proof for the presented

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
protocols

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,599
this is quite a serious problem because

67
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
the security of these protocols is based

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
on non-standard hardness assumptions

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,000
and thus we would like to have a clear

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,840
understanding of the security arguments

71
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
involved

72
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,680
finally some of the protocols rely on

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
trusted third-party assumptions such as

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
trusted hardware

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
since decentralization is an important

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,959
goal of blockchain protocols we would

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
like to avoid such assumptions

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
the question we study in this work is

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
whether we can build a useful work

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
blockchain that does not have this

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,280
drawbacks

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
in our paper we present a useful work

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
blockchain that can be used to solve

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
optimization problems such problems have

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,680
broad real world applications for

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,280
example in transportation and resource

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
allocation

88
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
moreover our protocol is accompanied by

89
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,720
a formal security proof in the random

90
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
oracle model

91
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
showing that the remains secured against

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
an adversary controlling close to 50

93
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
percent of the total computational power

94
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
in the network under favorable moderate

95
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,480
harness assumptions or 33 percent under

96
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
the same assumptions as bitcoin

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
and at close to 100 of the computations

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
performed are externally useful under

99
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
strong moderate harmless assumptions or

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
50 other weaker hardness assumptions

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,599
finally our analysis does not assume any

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
trusted third parties to prove our

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,239
protocol secure we designed and analyzed

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,959
a new generic proof of useful work

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
this is required first formalizing what

106
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
does it mean for a useful computation to

107
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,720
be moderately hard

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,879
secondly amplifying the security of this

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
computation so that it is grinding

110
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,560
resistant and can be used in the context

111
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
of permissionless protocols

112
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
and thirdly showing how the computation

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
can be embedded in the block mining

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
process which for security reasons has

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
three requirements on how open blocks

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
should be produced

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
finally putting all these ideas together

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,000
we present a generic local search

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
optimization algorithm that can be run

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,439
on our blockchain

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,840
thank you for watching
