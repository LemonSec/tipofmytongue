00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,560
hey everyone this is jaspal and today

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,640
i'll be giving an overview of our new

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
work on structural aware private set

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,280
intersection

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,360
this is a joint work with my co-authors

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,599
kaithri garipela and mike roslich at

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
oregon state university

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,840
so let's begin by looking at the

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,439
traditional private set intersection

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,400
problem

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
so there are two parties alice and bob

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
and they both have a set of discrete

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,279
points

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
and they are interested in learning the

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,720
set of points that are common to both

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,199
their sets

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,200
however there is an additional privacy

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
constraint which states that both the

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
parties should learn nothing but just

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
the intersection

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
which essentially means that bob does

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
not learn any of the elements of

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
is set outside the common elements o n r

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
and s

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
so this traditional problem of psi has

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
been well studied in the literature

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
so let's consider a variant of this

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
where alice and bob are holding a set of

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,280
gps coordinates in and around santa

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,719
barbara

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,480
and they are interested in learning if

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,360
they both have gps locations of any

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
common locations

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
now it's extremely unlikely that alice

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
and bob will have the identical gps

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
coordinates for a location

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,240
more likely cases that they would have

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,759
gps coordinates which are pretty nearby

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
hence we can formulate this problem as a

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
problem of fuzzy psi

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,439
where our goal is to learn the points of

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
alice and bob which are within some

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,679
distance delta for some parameter delta

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
so one nice way to solve this for cps

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
problem is to redefine alice's set

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
as

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
all the points contained within a delta

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
radius ball

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,960
around all its gps coordinates

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
and then we essentially run plane psi

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
between bob's points and alice's

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,240
expanded set

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
traditional psa protocols have

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
communication complexity proportional to

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,079
each party set

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
so in this case alice's communication

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
would be proportional to the expanded

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
set size

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
which in this case would be union of

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
delta radius balls

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
however

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
unlike plane psi in this case there is

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
some known structure over alice's input

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
set it's a union of delta radius balls

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
the question is can we improve the

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
communication complexity of psi when

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
there is a known structure over one of

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
the parties input sets

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
so in this work we introduce a new

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
framework for structure aware private

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,519
set intersection

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,599
which gives a very viable approach for

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,879
doing semi-honest fuzzy psi as mentioned

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
before

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,879
so we give very practical symmetric key

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
based psi protocols

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,360
for the case when alice's input set has

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
some publicly known structure

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
in our work we reduce this problem of

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,159
structure aware private set intersection

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,159
to a new variant of function secret

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,480
sharing which we term as weak fss

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,120
using this framework we reduce the psa

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
communication of alice to order lambda

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,319
times fss share size where lambda is the

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
security parameter and fss share size is

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
the share size for secret sharing the

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
structured set of values

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
so this is a considerable improvement

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,640
over

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
just the cardinality of the expanded set

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,120
in the cases when the fss share size can

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
be really small

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
for structured sets

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
other than the framework we also give a

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
number of new fss techniques which

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
allows us to construct really efficient

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
weak fss for union of geometric poles

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
which has applications for fuzzy psi

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
to learn more about our psa framework

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
