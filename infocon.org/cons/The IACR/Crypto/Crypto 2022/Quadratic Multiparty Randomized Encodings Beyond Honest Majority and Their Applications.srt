00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,799
this is the abstract video for upcoming

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,359
crypto 2022 talk about quadratic

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,679
multiparty runs randomized encodings

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,200
that go beyond the honest majority

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,280
privacy threshold and some of their

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,480
applications

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
this stock is based on a joint walk

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
between benny applebaum yuvali shai

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,400
arpita padra and myself

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
our work is in the field of secure

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
multiparty computation

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
this is a concept introduced in the late

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,400
80s

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,359
where several parties each one with its

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,360
own private input wish to jointly

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
compute some functionality of their

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,559
inputs and of course they need to do it

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
privately without leaking information

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,040
about their private inputs

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,559
the way it's done is usually with

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
protocols where the parties communicate

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
with each other over a number of rounds

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,840
and in the end receives their

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
functionalities output

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,640
privacy in protocols means that every

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,800
coalition of up to two parties learns

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
nothing beyond the output of the

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
functionality

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
we focus on information theoretic mpc

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,199
where the adversaries are

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
computationally unbounded which means

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,280
the simulation of the adversary's view

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
must be either statistic statistical or

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,119
perfect

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
and we focus on passive adversaries

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
which must you adhere to the protocol

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,840
and not deviate

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
before

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
talking about our work let us set a

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
motivating example the client server

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,960
model which it was introduced by balco

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
in this model the parties are divided

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
into two groups clients which hold the

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
inputs and receive the outputs

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
and servers which hold no inputs and

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
receive no outputs and only assist the

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
clients in computing the functionality

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
the interactions pattern resembles a

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
distributed variant of fhe

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
the protocol covers over in two hours

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
in the first round the clients send

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
sends a message to servers the servers

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,759
then do some local computation and

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,640
return

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
results to the clients

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
and then the clients can

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
receive the functionality's output

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
and our first motivating question was

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
can we achieve a protocol in this model

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,400
that is secure with an honest majority

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
of the servers and up to team malicious

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
clients where we focus on t larger than

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
half so beyond honest majority

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
and this question is open even in the

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
seamless case of three clients and three

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
servers

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
now let us move on to our model our main

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
model to mple which was introduced by

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
apple vermet

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,319
this model is highly non-interactive and

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,560
consists of a single called some large

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,519
degree to functionality

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
and this model is interesting because

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
apple vomit i'll show that for example

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
you can take a t private to a pre and

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
compile it into client server protocol

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
that is secure with an honest majority

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
of the servers and up to team malicious

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
clients

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
unfortunately all known constructions of

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,519
two apiary

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,519
are restricted to the rs majority

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,760
setting so the threshold is always less

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
than half

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,120
and our main question was can we

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
construct the two ampering

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
with a privacy threshold larger than

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
half

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,200
as it turns out the answer is positive

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,879
in our main theorem we have constructed

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
the two appearing with a privacy

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,560
threshold of two thirds

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
as an immediate call away we receive

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,599
a two api that is fully private in the

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
three party settings seen since two

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
thirds of three parties gives us full

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
privacy

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
this covenant immediately solves our

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
first motivating question in the free

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
client settings

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
since we have a fully private store

102
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
theory

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
furthermore we show an equivalence

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
theorem between two mpre and other

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
models that also rely on the ot

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
functionality

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
this equivalence gives us new results in

108
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
those models based on our new

109
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
construction of two appearing

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
also we show a surprising connection

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
between doing pairing and the protocol

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
in the active security model

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
let us have a quick overview of our main

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
theorem proof the proof is in two steps

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
in the first step which we call one

116
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
collapsing we show that allowing a plane

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
model conversation to happen before the

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
degree to functionality of twin theory

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
um adds no strengths so we show how to

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
compile a protocol in this plane and

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
quadratic model to a two impera

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
and in the second step we of course

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
construct a protocol in this new plain

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
and quadratic model with the desired

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
privacy threshold

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,720
thank you
