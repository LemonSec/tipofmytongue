1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,360
hi everyone my name is amiran and i will

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,200
present a joint work with bernie and

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,440
alpita about verifiable radiation

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
sharing and multibelly fell zero

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,800
knowledge into rounds delighting with

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
non-interactive zero knowledge with

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,679
honest majority

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,519
so that's a long time then let me first

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,000
present multi-verifier zero knowledge

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
in standard zero knowledge we have one

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
profile and one verifier and the prover

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
wants to prove that the statement exists

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
through without revealing any

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
information about the secret witness

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
dubbing and will acquire the standard

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,359
completeness sound reset and zero

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
knowledge properties

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
however in this work we are interested

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,559
in zero knowledge proofs where there is

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
one profile and many valid files and

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
this can be seen as the dual of multiple

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
zero knowledge and in fact it is a

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
common scenario in multi-party

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,480
computation

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
where one player wants to prove that

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
some statement is true to the rest of

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,719
the players in zero knowledge

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,079
we assume that the players can

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,680
communicate with each other over secure

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
channels and also that they have access

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
to a broadcast journey and will require

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
strong security even against an active

33
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
adversary that can deviate from the

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
protocol

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
and by strong security i mean it will

36
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
require a strong completeness notion

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
where an honest over can convince the

38
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
honest verifiers that the statement is

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,560
true even in the presence of co-op very

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
files

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,720
we also require simulation based zero

42
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,479
knowledge which means that the corrupt

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,000
valid files have no information about

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
the secret weakness

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,159
and a strong soundness here even if the

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
corrupt prover converts with some of the

47
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
valid files this thing cannot convince

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
the honest verifiers that the forms

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,439
statement is true

50
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,720
we also require

51
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
knowledge extraction which means that if

52
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
the honest value file is well convinced

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,560
that the statement is stored then the

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,720
secret witness can be extracted from the

55
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,000
joint view of the honest valid files

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
and in this work we focus on the round

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
complexity of protocols that achieve

58
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,119
those requirements

59
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,280
so a natural question is how many rounds

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,920
are acquired for mbck and in this work

61
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
we are very interested in two on

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
protocols so we ask can we get it around

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
mvck protocol

64
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
so it is known that there is no honest

65
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
so it is known that if there is no less

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
majority then the answer is no we cannot

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,759
get it to one protocol so this follows

68
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
from the classic work of congratulations

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
that shows that the two one protocol

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,400
exists only for bpp

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
i do want to mention that if there

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
exists a common random string

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,599
then there exists a protocol in which

74
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
only the approval sends a message so

75
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
this is not interactive zero knowledge

76
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,959
and it can be achieved either from

77
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,800
public key assumptions or in the random

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
work

79
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
so we said that without honest majority

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
we cannot get it to one protocol on the

81
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
other hand if there exists in on its

82
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
majority then there exists a two-round

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,120
protocol

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
and this protocol is implicit in the

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,959
work of otto nostrovsky and it can be

86
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
achieved from public encryption and

87
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
non-interactive zero knowledge

88
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,480
and this protocol has this nice feature

89
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
that the first round is independent of

90
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
the inputs so the players can execute

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
the first round even before the approval

92
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,519
knows the statement and the witness

93
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,440
which are only required for the second

94
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
round but as you can see the assumptions

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,959
required for this protocol are

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
essentially the same as for

97
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
non-interactive zero knowledge or even

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,959
stronger because with public encryption

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
so natural question is can we use the

100
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
fact that we have an honest majority in

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,879
order to get rid of the assumption of

102
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
non-industrial zero knowledge and in

103
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
particular can we use many cryptic

104
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
assumptions and we show that it is

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
possible so we assume the existence of

106
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
non-interactive commitments and we show

107
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,720
that there exists an mvdk protocol with

108
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
one or final round and one on one round

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
so that if the number of parties is

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,400
constant then we obtain optimal

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
resiliency which means that the number

112
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
of parties t should be less than half

113
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
the number of parties n

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
and if the number of parties is large

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
then we obtain an almost optimal

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
resiliency well the number of corrupt

117
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
particip should be at most one half

118
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
minus epsilon n the epsilon error is any

119
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
arbitrarily small constant

120
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
so now let me say a few words about

121
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,560
non-interactive commitments

122
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,519
so there are two types of

123
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
non-interactive commitments first we

124
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
have statistically hiding commitments

125
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,720
and if we use those commitments we

126
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
obtain a protocol

127
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,560
that provides everlasting security this

128
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,239
means that a protocol is secure against

129
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
an adversary which is bounded during the

130
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
execution of the protocol but can be

131
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
unbounded after the execution

132
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
and in order to construct such

133
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,400
commitments it is enough to assume that

134
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
the players are given access to a

135
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
commission-resistant hash function

136
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,519
now the second type is only

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
computationally hiding and if we use

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
those commitments we obtain a protocol

139
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
that provides standard computational

140
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
security

141
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
but in fact we also need the commitments

142
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
to provide security against selective

143
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
opening attacks and such commitments can

144
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
be constructed based on injective

145
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
one-way functions with sub-exponential

146
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,919
hardness

147
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
and even based on standard one-way

148
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
functions with sub-exponential hardness

149
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,120
together with the common random string

150
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
or under some randomization assumptions

151
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
and as an application our mvck protocol

152
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
can be seen as a substitute to

153
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
non-interactive zero knowledge where the

154
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
common random string is required to

155
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
distinguish offering rounds and the

156
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
proof name requires only one on one

157
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
round and the main point of course is

158
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,639
that you get all of this for many

159
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
reptile assumptions

160
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
and here are some more topics that i

161
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
will discuss in the talk so thank you

162
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
and see you in the talk
