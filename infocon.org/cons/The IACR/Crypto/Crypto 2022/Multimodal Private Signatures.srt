00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,480
hello everyone i am quang win from the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,879
university of wollongong australia

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
today i am going to talk about new

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,840
approach to address the tension between

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
privacy and accountability in multi-user

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,119
authentication systems

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,920
this is a child work with my colleagues

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
at the university of wollongong fujungo

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,480
willie sushilon and bomin yang

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,480
we become our new cryptographic

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,920
primitive multi-modal private signatures

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
here in the plan of my talk

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
first i will discuss several prominent

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
examples of previous multi-user

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
signature systems with privacy and

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
accountability features

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
and our observation regarding their

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
shortcomings

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
then i will demonstrate how our new

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
primitive can

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,120
address these

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,640
shortcomings

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
next i will sketch our definitions and

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,479
constructions from multimodal private

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,840
signatures

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
finally i will list

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
several interesting questions that we

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,400
left open

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,759
let us first consider the setting of

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
principle majors

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,520
one of the most well-known private

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,560
signature systems

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
we have a group of users

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
each user has a secret signing key which

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,479
can be used to sign message

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
in an anonymous manner

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
here signer would

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
personal identifiable information id can

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
issue a signature on any message

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
in a way such that the signature

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
verifiers can be convinced that a

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
signature was from someone in the group

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
but cannot determine who is

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
the actual assignment

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
here

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,479
ring signature provide absolute privacy

47
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
for science

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
absolute anonymity could be a nice

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
feature that protects the users in

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,760
certain situations

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
such as visual plugin

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
however it can also be abused for

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
unethical or illegal purposes

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
therefore

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
it would be desirable to restrict the

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
excessive anonymity of users in ring

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
signatures

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,959
in fact

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
there have been several attempts such as

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
linkable resignations or traceable

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
resignations

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
however

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
the linking and tracing mechanisms in

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560
this system

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
can only be activated if the signer is

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
questions has generated at least two

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
signatures

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
a malicious designer only issues one

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
controversial signature and then went

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
offline forever

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,560
then it can avoid accountability

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
if we look for a primitive offering both

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
anonymity and accountability

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
then the most well-known example is

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
group signature

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,840
in group signature we have an opening

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
authority whose secret key can be used

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
to trace any very signature and recover

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
the identity of the signer

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
this authority is supposed to take

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
action only in case of this views

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,040
but wait if zig authority is corrupted

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
then it can open all signatures at will

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,519
and in that case there is essentially no

85
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
privacy for users

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
there have been several attempts to

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
restrict the power of the opening

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
authority in group signatures

89
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
such as traceable signatures group

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
signatures with message dependent

91
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
opening are accountable facing

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,439
signatures

93
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,959
however in this system there is always a

94
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
party who can break

95
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
sinus privacy without any consent

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
so on the one hand we have ring

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
signature

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
and variants that give too much

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,279
privilege for users

100
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
on the other hand we have group

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
signatures and variants that provide too

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,919
much power

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,600
for the authorities finding a solution

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
that is reasonably fair for more users

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
and have authorities

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
a solution that balance privacy and

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
accountability

108
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
was a challenging problem

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
for a long time

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
a new approach towards solving this

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
tension was proposed last year at

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
eurocrypt

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,720
in a work by libert myself

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
vitus and you

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
we introduced biphobic anonymous

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
signatures of bias for short which can

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
be seen as a hybrid of ring signatures

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
and group signatures

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
more precisely a given bias could be

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
traceable or nontraceable

121
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,520
depending on a predicate bit pe

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,440
computed by the signer before signing

123
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
if peace is

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
euro then the signature is not traceable

125
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
and the authority can learn nothing

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,960
about ali as in ringside nature

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
if p is 1 then the signature is

128
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,120
traceable

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
and the authority can recover id

130
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
as in group signatures

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
since the user knows p in advance

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
it can control its privacy and

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,400
accountability

134
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
in the traceable case it can decide

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,800
whether to sign the given message or not

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
on the other hand

137
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
the authority can also ensure that

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,479
signers of all traceable signatures will

139
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,560
be kept accountable

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
so

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,479
bias

142
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,680
seems to have provided a nice solution

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
to the tension between privacy and

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
accountability

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
however

146
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
there are still problems

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
there is in fact a crucial disadvantage

148
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
of bias

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
approved signatures and all similar

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
proposals

151
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,720
we observe that

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,680
accountability in these systems

153
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
is realized

154
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
via a total tracing procedure

155
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
during which the whole identity of the

156
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,880
trace users must be disclosed to the

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,039
authorities

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,680
this level of accountability

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,840
is indeed a serious violation of users

160
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,240
privacy why privacy

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,039
can be a very complicated notion

162
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
in its previous sense it can be defined

163
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,599
as the right of an individual

164
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,039
to control

165
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
which piece of information about herself

166
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,039
or himself can be disclosed

167
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,599
furthermore in many real-life situations

168
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
it is not necessarily the highest

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
priority for authorities to perform a

170
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
total basing

171
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,319
for instance

172
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
the authorities could only be interested

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
in learning whether

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,520
an anonymous user is over 18 years old

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
or works in a given organization

176
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,680
or lives in a particular area

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
or has an annual income exceeding

178
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
certain threshold r has been fully

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,039
vaccinated against kovid knighting etc

180
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,840
this observation motivated us to

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
consider systems

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
in which users and authorities have

183
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
certain agreement

184
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,599
on which

185
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
piece of information can possibly be

186
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,440
disclosed for each signature

187
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,759
our proposal can be summarized as

188
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,960
follows

189
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
when setting up the system we specify a

190
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,880
list of signing functions and a list of

191
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
k disclosing functions

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
denoted by g1 t2 and so on to gk

193
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
where k is a positive integer

194
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,240
if user id wants to sign message m with

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,560
respect to assigning function f

196
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,080
then it first computes f of m w and id

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
where w is an auxiliary information that

198
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
we call a witness

199
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,680
it serves

200
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,279
as an evidence

201
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,360
for the solubility

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
of the tuple mw and id

203
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
the value of f is an integer between 0

204
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
and k

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
if it is 0

206
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
then m cannot be signed

207
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,839
and the user

208
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,600
aborts otherwise

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
when f is non-euro the user can generate

210
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,320
a very signature that is anonymous to

211
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
everyone

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
but the opening authority

213
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
so

214
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
what the opening authority can learn

215
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
then

216
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
if x is equal to 1 then it can learn the

217
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
function g 1 of id

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,519
and nothing else

219
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
if f is j for some integer j then it can

220
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,839
learn the function t j of id and nothing

221
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,839
else

222
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,040
the value of f indeed determines which

223
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
disclosing function

224
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
will be activated

225
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
looking back our proposal captures

226
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,760
ring signatures group signatures and

227
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,040
bias as special cases

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
ring and group signatures correspond to

229
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
the case of a single disclosing function

230
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,880
for releasing natures it is the euro

231
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
function

232
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
for group signatures it is

233
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
the identity function

234
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
meanwhile

235
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,120
bias corresponds to the case of two

236
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
disclosing functions

237
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
the euro

238
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,160
function and z identity functions

239
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
an example application

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
let us consider the scenario where we

241
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
have anonymous financial transactions

242
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,160
which has a hidden amount of money such

243
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
as in the privacy preserving

244
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,959
cryptocurrency system model

245
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
the authority for instance can regulate

246
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
the system as follows

247
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
when an amount less than 100

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,279
the transaction will be anonymous to

249
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
everyone including the authority

250
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
however

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,959
when the amount is between 100 and 1000

252
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,920
the authority will be able to learn

253
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
the country of the center

254
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,839
when the amount is between 1000 and ten

255
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,360
thousand

256
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,839
the authority can identify the country

257
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,680
and the organization of the center

258
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,720
finally

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,920
find them out at least ten thousand

260
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
then the full identity of the sender can

261
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
be traced

262
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
in other words we can have a 5 grand

263
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
accountability feature

264
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
depending on the underlying transaction

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
amounts

266
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
the authority can learn different pieces

267
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
of information about the sender

268
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
now let me summarize our contributions

269
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
first we propose the concept of

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,680
multi-modal private signatures or mps

271
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,959
which is a new approach for addressing

272
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
the tension between privacy and

273
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
accountability in multi-user signature

274
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,079
systems

275
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,519
signatures in mbs are anonymous to

276
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
everyone

277
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
except the opening authority

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
who can learn some special information

279
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
of

280
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
the user identity

281
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,399
that piece of information can be defined

282
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,680
in a flexible and fast manner

283
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,000
based on a set of disclosing functions

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
privacy

285
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
is naturally achieved in mbs

286
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
because signer can decide

287
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
which piece of personal information can

288
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
be disclosed

289
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,399
accountability is also achieved

290
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,800
since the authority can learn the

291
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,639
desirable information if needed

292
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
next we provide rigorous definitions for

293
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,320
mps

294
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
this step is quite exciting and is not

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
straightforward at all

296
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,200
we would like to make our definitions as

297
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
general as possible

298
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,680
by capturing not only the privacy and

299
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
accountability of green group and biases

300
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,680
natures

301
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,920
but also the 5 grand controls on who can

302
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
sign which message

303
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
as in attribute-based policy-based and

304
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
functional signatures

305
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,760
it is also worth highlighting

306
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,560
that

307
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
the privacy definitions for mps is quite

308
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
involved since we have to address the

309
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,519
case

310
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,680
where the opening authority is fully

311
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
corrupted

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
this level of privacy is impossible to

313
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,560
achieve

314
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,320
in ordinary work signatures

315
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
we provide a generic and modular

316
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
construction of mbs for arbitrary

317
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
functions based on commonly used

318
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,839
cryptographic building blocks

319
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,560
our construction can be instantiated in

320
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,120
the standard model from pairings

321
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,079
we also obtain a concrete lattice-based

322
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,239
construction in the random oracle model

323
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,000
regarding security of mps will require

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
two main properties privacy and

325
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,079
enforceability

326
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
privacy roughly ensures that each party

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,959
in the system can only learn the piece

328
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
of sinus information which designer

329
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
intends to disclose

330
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
there are in fact two notions of privacy

331
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
that we should consider

332
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,560
first

333
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
without the oa secret key it should be

334
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
infeasible for everyone to learn

335
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,839
anything

336
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,800
about

337
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,519
the signer's private information

338
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,639
second

339
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,079
even a fully corrupted oa cannot learn

340
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,959
anything beyond the value

341
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,040
tj of id

342
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
this is

343
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
a very strong requirement indeed

344
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
unfolds ability captures several

345
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
requirements first it should be

346
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
infeasible to generate a very signature

347
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,199
with respect to a turbo

348
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,320
mwid which is not assignable

349
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
second it should also be invisible to

350
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
mislead the signature opening

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,000
and third no one even a coalition of

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
corrupted group manager and

353
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
corrupted opening authority

354
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,079
can issue signatures on behalf of an

355
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,759
honest user

356
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
the second and third requirements

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
in fact resemble the notions of full

358
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,600
traceability and non-flammability in

359
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,040
dynamic root signatures

360
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,839
in terms of constructions we obtain a

361
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
generic construction of mps for

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
arbitrary science functions and

363
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
arbitrary disclosing functions

364
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,519
the construction relies on commonly used

365
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
cryptographic building blocks

366
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,680
namely ordinary resources nature's ccseq

367
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
public inclusion and non-interactive

368
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
neurologic proof for general statements

369
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
as a feasibility result the construction

370
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,079
can be realized in the standard model

371
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,759
from parents

372
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,880
via the growth of slovsky sahib system

373
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,920
and from lattices by the parker saihan

374
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,560
roof system

375
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,440
our construction follows the

376
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
size and encrypts improved paradigm

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
which is typically used for designing

378
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
good signatures

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,639
the group manager certifies the

380
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,160
membership

381
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
by assigning the user's identity

382
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
when issuing a signature the user

383
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
encrypts something

384
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
and improves welfareness of ciphertext

385
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
as well as knowledge of a valid

386
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
membership certificate

387
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,319
note that in group signature user

388
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,599
typically encrypts its phone identity id

389
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,799
in bias the ciphertext contains either

390
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,199
id or euro

391
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,359
here the main difference

392
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,599
is that cyber soft attack contains

393
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,918
exactly what needs to be disclosed

394
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,039
proven welfareness of certain subject in

395
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
general knowledge is the most important

396
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,640
step of the construction

397
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
as illustrations we instantiate the

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
system with concrete signing and

399
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
disclosing

400
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
functions

401
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
the correct evaluation of which can be

402
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
efficiently roofed in zero knowledge

403
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,320
we obtain a parent-based construction in

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,000
the standard model as well as a

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
lattice-based scheme in the random

406
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
oracle model that potentially enjoys

407
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
most quantum security

408
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
to be more specific in both

409
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
instantiations we consider the setting

410
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520
with a single signing function f and

411
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
four disclosing functions

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
we let message m

413
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,520
be a commitment to witness w and define

414
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,039
function f

415
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,440
based on integer ranges

416
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,760
this is to capture our motivating

417
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,160
example about anonymous financial

418
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
transactions with hidden amounts

419
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,919
we also consider this closing function

420
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,960
as linear transformation

421
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,760
of id which are sufficient for many

422
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,480
applications

423
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
the bearing based and lag by

424
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
construction follow the same paradigms

425
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
as the generic consumption but we employ

426
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
some of

427
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
the

428
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
dedicated building blocks for efficiency

429
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,200
reasons

430
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
specifically the very basic employs

431
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
medicine commitment

432
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,919
structure preserving signature by

433
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
kindest on the bonnevillian signature

434
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
type-based bke by

435
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,880
kings and the gross sahaprus

436
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
meanwhile

437
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,280
the lag-based scheme used the ktx

438
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
commitment

439
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,919
a signature scheme good efficient

440
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,400
protocols by libertadore

441
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,520
ccscq pke obtained from the gbvib and

442
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,480
the csk transformation

443
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
and the stern-like internal argument

444
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,360
systems

445
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,120
finally

446
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,400
as the first work on multi-modal private

447
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,679
signature

448
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,799
we do not expect to provide a totally

449
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,679
uh thorough study of this primitive

450
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
we leave several interesting open

451
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
questions for future

452
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
investigations

453
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
the first question

454
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
is to construct practically usable npsc

455
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,080
schemes which expands expressive signing

456
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,000
and scoring disclosing functions

457
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,840
designing efficient mps schemes with

458
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
both quantum security is also a

459
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,039
fascinating questions

460
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,919
note that our proposed parent-based and

461
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,960
latin consumption

462
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
do capture quite expressive functions

463
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,000
but are not very efficient

464
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
from the theoretical perspective

465
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
it is worth studying the connections

466
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,760
between mps and other advanced

467
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,039
primitives

468
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,240
like functional encryption

469
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,360
in fact

470
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
the idea that decryption reveals a

471
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,960
function of the identity

472
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
is closely related

473
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
to the spirit of functional encryption

474
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
however

475
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
so far we have been unable to obtain a

476
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,400
consumption of mps based on

477
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
functional encryption

478
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,080
another appealing question is to equip

479
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,000
mbs with

480
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
additional functionalities such as

481
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,919
verifiable opening

482
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,840
or user revocations

483
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,520
and let me conclude my presentation here

484
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
thank you for your attention i am happy

485
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
to answer your questions

486
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
either online after the talk

487
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,880
or via emails thank you
