00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,720
hello everyone my name is

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,519
and welcome to my abstract presentation

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,480
of my paper perfectly secure reflection

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,599
service

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,000
so this is a joint work with timber

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
crypto crevice has long been fascinated

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,640
by the self-inverse property of the

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
encryption devices

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,760
the example is enigma rotor machine

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
where the encryption and the decryption

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
operations are identical

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
this is enabled by the middle reflector

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
which makes encryption device much more

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
confident

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
this self-interest property

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
can also be found in the molten cyphers

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,879
for example the cyphers that's based on

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
the iso network

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,960
the famous example is the best box item

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
so a special property of those physical

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,320
cycles is that decryption is always

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
possible which is equal to encryption

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,640
using volunteers in the reverse order

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
this property

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
makes the fact that underlying mod

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,759
functions do not need to be invertible

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,040
anymore

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
which gives us much more flexibility

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
when we need to choose those front

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
functions

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,759
now another property is that

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,119
the input stream is not um

33
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,520
and not the entire input stream is

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
updated every month so we can see from

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
the slide on your part of the input

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,680
screen

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
using the broad function

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
the generic security of iso cypress is

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
first stopped by ruby and dragon in

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,560
1985.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
another class of another important class

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,680
um the cyprus is designed

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,159
using the so-called key alternating

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
cycle structure the fitness example is

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,680
the aes boxing

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,920
here the authors were inspired by

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
children's idea

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,560
and to see how the naming cybers have

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
the poverty that's they usually require

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
less frontal

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
science

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
for example there's only 10 rounds

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,160
needed for 128 speed key to as well 16

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
mods are needed for the desk website

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
another property is fast diffusion since

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
the entire bit stream is updated every

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
month

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
now the limitation of the key

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
alternating cycles results and they do

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
not have something responsible like the

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
physicists

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
the generic security of which automating

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,599
cyprus

64
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,239
was first started by event masu in 1991

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
with a single bronze case

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,519
and 5 book tango fetal in

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,239
2012 with the mutable ground case

68
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
now as mentioned before both the bison

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
cycles and the pronating science have

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
their own advantage and their

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,000
limitations

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
the question now is whether we can

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
combine those two ideas and

74
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
get a new design structure such that

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
similar to the key automating site

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
structure such that um less fronts are

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,239
needed to design secure cyber while

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
still obtaining the self-image property

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,319
of the physics cycles

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,040
the answer is given by both of metal in

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
2012 where they introduce a prince

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,799
reflection site

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
since um the cipher is based on

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
the

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
following structure which which is shown

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
on the slide

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,519
we call this design structure the key

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
alternating reflection size

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
so cypher space of the structure has a

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
formula friction property namely

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,599
decryption is always equal to encryption

92
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
using related keys

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
because of this special property the

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
reflection servers

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
are in particular suitable for low

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,000
latency low area use case

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
however

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
until now there's no

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
study performance on the genetic

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,360
security of the reflection cycles

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
therefore in this work we

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
initialize for the first time the

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
general representing the generic

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,720
security of the key alternating

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
reflection cycles

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
based on the results

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
we um we used um our results to design

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
new keylet extender that can be used for

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
practical reflection cycles such as

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,960
fringe modis

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
the full version of this presentation

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
can be bounced

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,919

april 2022

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,280
thank you for your attention
