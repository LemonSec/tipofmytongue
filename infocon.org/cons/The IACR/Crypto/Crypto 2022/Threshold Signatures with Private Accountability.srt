1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,080
hi everyone

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,839
my name is chelsea comlow and i'm here

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,400
to present a joint work with dan bonnet

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,000
on threshold signatures with private

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,719
accountability

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
so just as a quick recap about what

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,600
threshold signal signatures are they're

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,359
a public private scheme

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,519
where uh some set of signers is

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,000
represented by a single public key and

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
the private key is secret shared among

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
some set of signers where only a

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,159
threshold are required to issue a

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,280
signature

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
so here we can see a message coming into

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,640
the set of signers

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
two signers will sign and send what we

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
call signature shares to combiner

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
and the combiner will output the final

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,079
signature that represents the group

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,520
and what's important is that when

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
signers perform signing they aren't

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
sending their secrets to each other

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
uh they're kept locally and the full

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
secret is never actually reconstructed

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,920
so in the literature there are two types

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,719
um

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,600
of

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,440
what are mutually exclusive threshold

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,640
schemes

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
the first are what we call pts's and

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
they're fully private threshold schemes

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
and you can think of some of these as

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
those that require that rely on schmear

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
secret sharing

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
and the second type are what we call

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
ats's so accountable threshold schemes

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
and these are also known in the

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
literature as accountable subgroup

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,360
multi-signatures

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
so um really where pts's and ats's

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,159
differ is who learns what information

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,920
from this signature

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
so in an ats

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
everyone learns the signing quorum and

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
every learn everyone learns the

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,680
threshold whereas in a pts

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
only the signers

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
that participate in signing learn the

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
threshold in the signing form

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,119
so in this work

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
we introduce a new type of threshold

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,479
signature and what this is is

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
a threshold signature that is both

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
private and accountable and we call this

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,439
scheme attacks

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
so like a pts

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
for taps the public does not learn the

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,840
threshold or the signing quorum

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
but like in ats the signing form can be

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,879
recovered but it can only be recovered

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
by a designated entity

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,959
so um

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
basically we get the best of both worlds

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,519
of a pts and an ats in the same scheme

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,720
so a bit more formally edtaps is a tuple

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
of five algorithms key gen sign combine

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
verify and trace

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
and attacks must be unforgeable like any

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
signature scheme

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,519
and it must be private and we

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
differentiate between two privacy

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
notions the notion of privacy against

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
the public and privacy against other

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
signers

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,040
and the scheme must be accountable

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,720
uh for unforgeability this is the same

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,440
notion as for any threshold scheme so we

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,920
assume an adversary can control up to t

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
minus one signers and the scheme is

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
unforgivable if the adversary uh cannot

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
output a valid signature

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
and for accountability we don't make any

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
assumption on the number of parties that

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,120
the adversary controls

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
and we say that this game is accountable

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
if the adversary can't output a

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
signature that traces to an honest

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
non-signer

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,800
for privacy uh

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
we say that

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,519
a taps is private against the public

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,599
if it doesn't reveal anything about the

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
threshold or quorum of signers to anyone

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
that's not trusted to be a signer

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
so that's what we refer to as the public

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
for privacy against signers the taps

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,680
reveals nothing about the quorum to any

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
signer so from a tap signature even if i

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
miss if even if i'm a signer i shouldn't

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
be able to tell who's signed

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,439
we then um give a generic taps and what

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,840
the generic taps is is it proves in

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,239
generic zero knowledge then an encrypted

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,640
ats signature is valid

106
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,480
so this signature

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
includes a ciphertext which is the

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
encryption of an ats signature to the

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,439
tracer or this designated entity

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
it includes a zero knowledge proof that

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,879
the ats is valid

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
and it includes a signature that it was

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,560
issued by the combiner

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
we then

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
give a schnoor construction

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
but we

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
first

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
observe that proving um a schnorr

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
signature is valid and generic zero

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,160
knowledge is actually quite expensive

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,520
because it requires proving that the

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
output of a hash function is derived

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
correctly

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
and so we actually um have an insight on

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
our shoretaps construction

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,320
and this insight is that publishing uh

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
the schnorr commitment which is a

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
commitment to randomness does not

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
actually hurt privacy and only the

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
response

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
needs to be protected

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
and so uh this insight allows us to

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
improve over generic zero knowledge

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
and so in our short construction the

135
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
verifier actually derives the challenge

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,440
directly and this results in a simpler

137
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
zero knowledge statement and something

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,759
that's more efficient

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,560
so overall in this work we introduce the

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,639
taps which is a new type of threshold

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
signature that is both private and

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
accountable

143
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
we then define a generic construction

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,600
that employs an encrypted ats

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
and then we build on this generic

146
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
construction with an insight about the

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
structure of schnorr signatures that

148
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,479
simplifies the zero knowledge statement

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,240
and then finally we define sigma and

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
bulletproof instantiations of the zero

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
knowledge argument for the schnorr

152
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,440
construction

153
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,080
thank you very much
