00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,000
good morning everyone my name is phuong

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,839
i'm from nanjiang technological

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,919
university in singapore

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
i will present our paper triangulating

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,799
without attack on ies like casting

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,280
this is a joy work with xiao yangdong

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,920
from ingham university

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,880
jan vu sundy and me from singapore

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
the rebound attack was first introduced

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,560
by mandate at all which is an efficient

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,640
way to find the collision or hash

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,679
function

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,000
by fulfill a heavy meter round or

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
inbound part of a differential part for

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,200
free

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
utilizing the degree of freedom from the

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
states

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
in the previous work the inbound pairs

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
are found manually using the super xbox

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,600
technique which can cover up to two runs

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
the best collision attack on a yes is

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
seven round in quantum setting and up to

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,879
sixth round in classical setting

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
in this paper we

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,359
further developed the line of research

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
on rebirth attack by introducing super

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
inbound quick is the multiple inbound

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,560
phases

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,360
and can cover three to four rounds in

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
the middle

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,520
using the fact that the attacker can

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
freely choose the key in semi-freestyle

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
collision attack

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
we utilize the degree of freedom from

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,680
the key values

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
to match the state values

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
and automatically find the solution of

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,520
inbound parts by solving the system

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
equation

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
of super inbound

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
with triangulation algorithm

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
this algorithm is an efficient way

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,680
to

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
solve the nonlinear system of equation

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
weak input is a set of fixed variables

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
and it will output

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
the remaining three variable variables

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,759
we apply the new method

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
to obtain

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
the new semi-free start collision attack

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
on ies like

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,119
hussing and

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,640
especially the first sixth round

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,599
semi-freestyle collision of ies

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,520
128 mmo is given

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,040
to describe

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
the method an example of seven ratio is

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
given

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,400
with the inbound path in figure 1 here

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
assume that a valid differential

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
characteristic is found for this trail

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
we can access to the differential

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,360
distribution table to obtain the values

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
of all active bias in y3 y4 and y5

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
the values of

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
k4 and k5 are chosen carefully so that

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
they have to match those

68
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
no blue buys

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
so

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
since ies has a basis of 32 bytes

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,360
when 31 bytes

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
in blue color are fixed here

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
the triangulation will have to find the

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
last free by automatically

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
quick is k512 in this case

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
right our results are presented in this

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
table

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,599
with several

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
you can see that several of new attack

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,879
on a yes onto it mmo

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,280
or mp

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
and skinny hearts are given

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
and we also improve several attacks on

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,920
skinny hearts and glowstone

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
so

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
details will be given in my talk on

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
monday 10 am

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,799
see you yeah bye
