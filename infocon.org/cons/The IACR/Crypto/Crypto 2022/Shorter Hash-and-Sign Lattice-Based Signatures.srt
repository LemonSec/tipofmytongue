00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,000
hi everyone I'm Thomas Pito I'm happy to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
present you today some of the results on

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,600
the compression of fashion sanitis based

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,099
signatures CC's joint work with

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,580
meditibushi Alexander and young you

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,259
first let me present you some of the

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,940
signatures you can find in the world in

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,420
2022 so in this small Panorama I will

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,939
draw circles which area is proportional

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,859
to the size of the signature itself so

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,900
let's start with the archbase signature

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,720
so thanks plus picnic and xmms which are

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,359
all pretty big and then the lattice ones

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,579
the lithium and Falcon the finalist to

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,280
the uh nice competition in the lattice

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,300
case and for reference RSA and ecdsa on

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
8 watts curves which is very small in

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,399
comparison the aim of this tour today is

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,260
to show you how to take Ashen sign

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,940
lattice based signature so Falcon in

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,280
this case and to reduce them for almost

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,260
three so in order to see how to compress

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,719
let me show you first how to sign and

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,539
let's go for this 101 crash course on

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,180
Ashen sign over lattices

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,879
so what do we do we check our message M

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,220
and we first shoot in the object space

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,040
of our lattice so it's not a not a

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
lattice Point somewhere around okay and

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,020
using the secret key I will constructive

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,880
discrete gaussian sample which is now

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
all a teaspoon so for instance this

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,979
lucky Point V in here and my signature

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,900
will simply be the difference uh between

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,880
the sample and the hash of the message

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,560
this is a short Vector we're pretty

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
happy with that okay so on specific

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,780
class of lattices such as QR lattices uh

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,299
where in which Andrew belongs to we have

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,920
a very interesting property which allows

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
us to work modulus q and if we do so

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,280
actually what happened is that we can

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,579
represent the lattice punch mode Q only

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,799
by half of the coordinate soil in

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,079
dimension 2 only by the x-coordinate for

46
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,780
instance and this means that in our case

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,180
we can simply take the first coordinate

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,520
and say oh that's my signatures and this

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,079
is actually sufficient because from that

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,200
we can fully reconstruct the signatures

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,540
the vector signatures itself so what do

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,939
we do is just see which is the lattice

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,098
points in the cosets mod Cube

54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,440
corresponding to my signatures select it

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,420
and do the difference with the hash of

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,640
the message then we retrieve the vector

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,680
we constructed at the signing time and

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,440
we only need to check if this Vector is

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,660
small enough to be accepted as a valid

60
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,739
signature

61
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,160
so if we want to assign using these QR

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,860
lattices we will have signatures which

63
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,200
lies in this orange circle which are on

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,720
the x-axis so if we want signatures

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,519
which are smaller we want to select

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,500
points which are closer to the origin

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
okay it's pretty easy

68
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
so our first idea we can have is to

69
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,980
unbalance the signatures so how can we

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,080
do that so in the current state we are

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,940
sampling a gaussian point around the

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,160
hash of the message according to a

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,379
discrete version which is spherical so

74
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,599
isotropic we don't favor any possible

75
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,840
Direction but instead if we start to

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,659
unbalance the distribution itself to

77
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,120
favor points which are aligned on the

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,540
y-axis we will of course have signatures

79
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,879
which are favored to be closer to the

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
origin we're happy with that

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,860
so equivalently what we can do if we

82
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,780
still want to sample using spherical

83
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,879
gaussians is to unbalance the lattice

84
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,280
itself so we can compress it adding more

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,620
points and if we want to keep this a qri

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,940
property we need to preserve the

87
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,739
determinant so we need to expand it on

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,319
the y-axis at the same time so we'll get

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,799
this lattice which is a distortion on

90
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,900
the x-axis and on the y-axis at the same

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,459
time okay

92
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,500
so if we do so and look at what happened

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,200
my Q as before we see that we have far

94
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,900
more points closer to the origin so in

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400
particular when we're going to sample

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,920
spherical discrete gaussians over this

97
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,400
lattice we will favor more points to be

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,299
close to zero

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,739
so now we can just replace everything we

100
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,439
did by taking this unbalanced lattice as

101
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,780
our base lattice to work and nothing

102
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,659
else change we're happy with that

103
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,580
and then you could say Oh Thomas we're

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,920
working mode Q everywhere so whatever if

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,140
we just say I want a smaller queue and

106
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,180
this is actually a very neat idea

107
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,099
because if we start here with an example

108
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,620
with Q equal 7 replaced by smaller Q

109
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,600
let's say 3.50

110
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,339
we get more plants closer to the origin

111
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,860
and we can do even closer and just

112
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,960
reduce Q so that our signature will be

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,660
of size q and we are happy with that

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,699
so is it a free range can we just reduce

115
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,620
everything for free can we distort for

116
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,600
free can you reduce Q as small as you

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,500
want

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,820
sadly the answer is a big no

119
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,800
so we need to be careful on the security

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,979
impact of the choices we can have still

121
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,740
very concrete impact and we can ensure

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,139
that we can reduce the size of Falcon

123
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,479
512 to 410 bytes and Falcon 1024 to a

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,199
780 bytes which is in any case a gain of

125
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,960
around 30 percent so this has very

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
concrete impact and start to give

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
signatures with our roughly size of RSA

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,520
and preserve security at least level one

129
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,419
and nist level 5. I'd be very happy to

130
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,460
show you more of that and how to deal

131
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,660
with the attack and give you more

132
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,539
details at the crypto talk in a few days

133
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,919
thank you very much for your attention

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,840
and see you in Santa Barbara
