1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a short teaser presentation for

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,919
the paper parallel repetition of special

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
sound multi-round interactive proofs by

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
thomas optima and myself

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
in this paper we address and partly

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
solve a very basic question in the

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
context of interactive proofs of

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,640
knowledge

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
what happens to the knowledge er meaning

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
to the probability to cheat when you

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
repeat such a proof of knowledge in

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
parallel

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
now easily you expect the knowledge

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,320
error to go down to zero exponentially

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
fast with the number of repetitions but

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
this is not always the case

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,800
i find it actually surprising that prior

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
to our work very little was known about

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,480
this very natural question

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,079
let me mention that one sometimes

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
encounters variations of the definition

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
of a proof of knowledge in the

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,520
literature this of course changes the

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
game

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,399
in our work we consider the original

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,640
standard definition

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
let me also stress that the situation is

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
quite different when considering the

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
ordinary soundness error meaning the

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
probability to make the verifier accept

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
no instance

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
here it is quite well understood how the

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
sun is earth behaves under parallel

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,080
repetition however these results and

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
techniques do not carry over to the

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,520
knowledge error but we require

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,799
extractability of a witness from any

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
sufficiently successful proofer

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
indeed prior to our work only sort of

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,280
two extreme cases were known

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
on the one hand for a general proof of

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
knowledge it is known that the knowledge

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
error does not go down to zero

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
exponentially fast and even super

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
polynomially fast in general a

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
noticeable knowledge remains on the

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
other end of the spectrum it is known

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
that a very special class of protocols

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,439
behave as expected namely the two

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
special sound sigma protocols

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
here the reasoning is very simple it is

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
known that the two special sound sigma

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,640
protocol as a knowledge are one over the

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
size of the challenge set and then the

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
exponential decrease of the knowledge

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
error follows from the observation that

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,878
the parallel repetition of two special

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
sound sigma protocol is again a two

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,599
special sound sigma protocol but now

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
with an exponentially large challenge in

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,040
it

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
prior to our work nothing was known in

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
between these two extreme cases and in

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
our work we start filling this gap by

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,400
extending the simple result for two

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
special sound sigma protocols to orbit

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,000
three k special sound sigma protocols as

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
well as to the appropriate notion of

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
special sound multi-round protocols

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
thus for all these protocols which cover

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
a large portion of all the practically

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
relevant proofs of knowledge including

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
bullet proofs and variations thereof we

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
show that the knowledge error behaves as

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
you would as you would wish

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
meaning that it goes down to zero

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
exponentially fast on the parallel

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
repetition

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
towards proving our results one might

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
hope that the simple argument for two

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
special sum protocols can be recycled

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
for these general special sum protocols

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,400
but that's not the case

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
the problem is that the parallel

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
repetition of say a three special sound

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
protocol is not three special sound

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
anymore its special sound this parameter

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
is exponentially large which then kills

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
the argument even worse so for

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,560
multi-round protocols

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
thus we need an entirely new way to

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
reason which we develop in the paper at

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,159
the core is the observation that the

94
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
success probability of the cheating

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
prover is not the right figure of mary

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,760
to work with in this context instead we

97
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,120
identify and study a fine grained sort

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
of a punctured success probability which

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,680
turns out to characterize extractability

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
and second behave nicely on the parallel

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
repetition so putting these two together

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
the leads to our results

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
more details will be provided by thomas

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
in the conference presentation so i hope

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,959
to see you there
