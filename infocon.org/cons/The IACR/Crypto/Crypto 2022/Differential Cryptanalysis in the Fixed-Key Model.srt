00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,080
welcome to this video abstract about the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,679
paper differential crypts analysis in

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,040
the fixed key model which i'll be

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
presenting at crypto on wednesday

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
today's paper is about differential

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,559
cryptanalysis what we're going to be

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,679
doing here

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,480
is

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
we have a function f and we're going to

10
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
take an input x and we're going to add a

11
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
difference a to it and then we're going

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,039
to see if the output pair that we get

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
has a certain difference b

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
and ideally we would like to find a pair

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
of differences a and b also known as a

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,199
differential

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,679
so that there are many solutions x to

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,520
this different equation and the number

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
of solutions divided by 2 to the n is

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
what we call the probability of the

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,360
differential so the basic problem here

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,520
is how do we compute this probability

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
and this is a difficult problem because

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
our function f is something complicated

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
like a block cipher

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,559
so one technique that we can use for

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,760
this is known as differential

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
characteristics and it assumes that this

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
function f can be written as a

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,360
composition of a number of easier to

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,840
understand

32
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,440
functions and what we're going to do is

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
we're going to specify intermediate

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
differences so a sequence of such

35
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
intermediate differences is what we call

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
a differential characteristic and then

37
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
the probability of your differential is

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
the sum over the probabilities of all

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,479
these differential characteristics

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,400
that somewhat simplifies things but it

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
doesn't actually tell us how to compute

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
the probability of those characteristics

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,560
for that we typically use a heuristic

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
which says that the propagation through

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
f1 f2 and so on can be treated as

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
independent now this doesn't actually

47
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,240
make sense

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
but you can make it make some sense by

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
saying that if we add uniform random

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,000
round keys after each of those functions

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
then the average probability of the

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
characteristic can be expressed in this

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,439
way in an exact way

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
that's nice but it's not really what we

55
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
want because

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
in order to be able to actually compute

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
data complexities and success

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
probabilities accurately we would need

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
to know the fixed key probability

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
or at least more than the average so

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
what people have been doing is they've

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
been assuming that

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
the fixed key probabilities are usually

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
close to the average probabilities so

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
let's take a look if that actually makes

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
sense

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
so here's an example of a six round

68
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
differential in spec 32

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
so

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,560
the red line here is the

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
computed average

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
so the expected number of um

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
right pairs

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,599
or same thing as the probability

75
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,560
and then

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
what we would expect is that most of the

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
keys would have a probability that is

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
close to this red line but as you can

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
see that's not really the case so the

80
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,239
probability for most keys is not close

81
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
to the average and

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
there's a lot of things going on here

83
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
you can see different peaks but the main

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,480
takeaway here is that if you would use

85
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
the average to compute things like the

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
data complexity here that would give us

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
incorrect results

88
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,840
so

89
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
the goal of this paper was essentially

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,599
to explain figures like this one

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
and in order to do that

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,200
we introduce what we call quasi

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
differential trails so we do that by

94
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
first introducing an extension of the

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
difference distribution table known as

96
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
the quasi differential transition matrix

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,360
and

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,200
this if you know linear cryptanalysis

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
this can be thought of as sort of

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
analogous to correlation matrices that

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
you have there

102
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
the main property of this matrix is that

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,480
if you have a composition of functions

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
then you can just multiply the

105
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,159
difference distribu the quasi

106
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
differential transition matrices in

107
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,760
order to obtain the quasi differential

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
transition matrix of your composite

109
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,040
function

110
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
and if you express that in terms of the

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
coordinates of these matrices you get

112
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,799
some sum over

113
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
a certain

114
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
amount of products

115
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,120
and

116
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
the terms in this sum are

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
going to correspond to what we call

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,440
quasi differential trails and the things

119
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
we're assuming are going to be the

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
correlations of those

121
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
trails

122
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,640
and using this we can actually often get

123
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,120
a pretty good model

124
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
for how the probability behaves under a

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
fixed key

126
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
so for example going back to the example

127
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
that i showed before

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
so this six round differential for spec

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
so there you find that there are

130
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,639
actually five quasi differential trails

131
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
which have an absolute correlation

132
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,160
that's

133
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
significantly larger than most of the

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
other quality differential trails so

135
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
using those five provides a pretty good

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
model and as you can see on the figures

137
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
so the red lines are the values that

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
this model predicts for the

139
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
probabilities

140
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
this is a pretty good match and you can

141
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
increase the accuracy of this by

142
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,840
including more quasi differential trails

143
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
so this is all i will say for the

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,720
abstract

145
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
in the full version of this uh

146
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
presentation

147
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
i'll talk more about how we construct

148
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
those quasi differential transition

149
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
matrices

150
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
and what their properties are

151
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,600
and then i'll show how we go from there

152
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
to quasi differential trails

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
and also talk about some of the

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
applications that we have in the paper

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,639
thank you for your attention
