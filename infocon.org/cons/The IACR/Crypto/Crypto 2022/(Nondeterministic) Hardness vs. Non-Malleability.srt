1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,879
are you concerned about your memory

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,440
being tampered by polynomial size

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
circuits

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,120
are existing non-malleable code

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,239
solutions not explicit enough for you

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,320
do you lie awake at night

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
wondering if cryptography really exists

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
are you ready to bring the power of

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,119
non-deterministic reductions into your

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
life

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
if so then you should read

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
hardness

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,360
non-deterministic hardness

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
versus

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,520
non-valuability

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
in this paper you will learn how to

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
build non-valuable codes and much more

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,520
from d randomization type assumptions

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
learn what a non-valuable code actually

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
is and what these assumptions actually

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,680
are

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,079
particular you will see the following

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,440
theorem

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,159
if e is hard for exponential size

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
non-deterministic circuits then for any

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
constant c explicit non-malleable codes

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
for circuits of size n to the c exist

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
with statistical security and to the

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,520
minus c

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
one note that one over poly security is

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
optimal from such assumptions under

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
black box reductions however negligible

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
security is still possible for certain

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
applications consult a full version or

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
your friendly cryptographer to see if

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,040
these constructions are right for you
