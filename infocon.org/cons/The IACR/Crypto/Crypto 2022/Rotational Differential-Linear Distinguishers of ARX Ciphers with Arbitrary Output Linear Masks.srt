this is a short video of our paper

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,960
rotational differential linear

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120
distinctions of ax cipher with arbitrary

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,599
output linear max

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,240
i'm juvent this is joint work with

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
switzerland human and charging

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,039
differential and linear group analysis

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,600
are the most general method to analyze

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
block cipher there are some combined

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,359
varieties including borrowing

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
differential linear and rotational

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,680
differential linear

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
and the differential linear can be

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
considered as a special cases of

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
rotational differential linear in this

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
talk we will focus on rotational

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
differential linear

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
for vectorial boolean function given the

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
rotational input difference delta output

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,320
mass gamma we can build a rotational

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,800
differential linear distinctions by a

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
linear approximation of rotational

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
output difference

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
and the problem is how to estimate the

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
correlation

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
often we divide the cipher in two parts

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
and the correlation of rotational

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
differential linear distinction is

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,280
attempted as

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,479
four times p times epsilon times epsilon

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,520
prime

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,400
but the bond measure may not be accurate

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
for differential linear components

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
the differential linear connective tip

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
was proposed to accurately compute the

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,799
correlation of differential linear

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,159
distinctions later at crypto 2021

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
another method was proposed to compute

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
the correlation of differential linear

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
distinction from outright points but

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
0.2 method is only applicable for the

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
spn ciphers not for the x ciphers

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
and for rotational differential linear

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,360
group analysis

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,878
more vest case technique is adopted to

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,760
compute the correlation of rotational

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,800
differential linear distinctions

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
however the main problem is that is only

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
applicable for the output max with hand

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
weight one

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
about motivation

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
first for the ax cipher differential

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
linear group analysis is one of the most

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
powerful measures compute the

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
correlation of differential linear

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,720
distinction for exception is attractive

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
second modulo addition is a co

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,599
component

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,440
for x cipher

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
some properties must be clarified

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,599
such as a correlation of differential

62
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,720
linear or rotational different linear

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
however

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
for modulation there is no phenomenal

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
time algorithm to compute the collision

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,239
of

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
differential linear or rotational

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
different linear

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
and in practice the modular addition

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,400
often operates on large words unlike

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,599
xbox

72
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,400
the v of immune

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
input pair is inflexible

74
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,640
in this paper we will solve the

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,840
following two

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,560
problems

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
for the first problem we propose the

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
partition scheme of the overall input

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
space

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,360
based on it for modular addition

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
we give a formula that can compute the

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
exact correlation of arbitrary

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
differential linear distinctions and

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,439
rotational differential linear

85
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
distinctions in phenomenal time

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
for the second problem

87
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,439
we completely generalized the novice

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
case technique and gave the new method

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
to estimate the correlation of arbitrary

90
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
differential linear distinctions and

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
rotational differential linear

92
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
distinctors for x cipher

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,399
then we apply it on round reduced assets

94
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
zip hash charger and spec

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
and it works very well

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,040
we get a series of practical

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
distinctions and we summarize it on the

98
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
table
