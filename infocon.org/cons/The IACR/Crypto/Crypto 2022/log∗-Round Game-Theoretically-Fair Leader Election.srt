00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,600
hi everyone this is an abstract talk for

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,440
our paper lobster around game

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,440
theoretically fair leader election

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,639
so um this is me and this is elon we

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,559
need to decide who will go present the

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,279
paper at crypto conference

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,520
since we're in different city we decide

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
to do bloms coin toss protocol on the

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,640
blockchain

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,039
if the output is zero then elo wins and

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
he will go otherwise i will go present

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
the paper

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
so we each choose a random bit and post

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,360
the commitments of the random bit on

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
blockchain if you're not familiar with

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
blockchain you can just think of it as a

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
public bulletin board so after we post

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,800
the commitments everyone can see it

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
after we post the commitments we each

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
open our random bit and post the opening

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
on blockchain

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
let's say my bit is zero and eon speed

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
is one then the output would be the xor

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,199
of these two bits which is one so i went

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
and here i am

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
however elon really wants to go to the

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
beach in santa barbara so after i post

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,240
my beat on the blockchain he knows he's

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
gonna lose the game if he opens his bed

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
what if he refused to open his comments

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,759
in this case i just automatically wins

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,119
and output

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,640
is still one

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
so this is the famous blom's coin toss

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,759
portal

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
and it guarantees that a strategic

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
player like elon cannot bias the output

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
towards his preference

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
formally in a coin toss protocol we want

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
to toss a uniformly random coin

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,360
the fairness notion considered in

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
traditional crypto literature is called

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
strong fairness

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
or unbiasability which requires that a

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
strategic player cannot bias the output

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,399
was either direction

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
unfortunately this is trying to be

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
impossible against more than half-size

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,479
collision by cleve in 1986.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
but we just saw that blom's coin toss

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
protocol achieves some fairness which is

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
more of a game theory favor it

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
guarantees that a strategic player

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
cannot benefit itself by deviating from

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,959
the protocol nor can it

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
harm an honest individual

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
so

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
a natural question to ask is what if we

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
generalize tomorrow party as you might

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
have seen our paper has four co-authors

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
so when it comes to multiple parties we

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
have a leader election problem that

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,879
elects a leader from n players

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
the winner gains utility one and it

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,480
takes all the other just gain utility

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,440
zero

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,680
so some of the players say illing and

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,319
elon they may form a coalition and they

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
want to bias the output towards their

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,958
favor

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
in linear elections still we also care

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,599
about the game theoretic fairness

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
we want to guarantee that no collision

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
can increase its expected utility and no

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,519
coalition can harm any honest individual

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,159
one thing is why do we care about this

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,800
because strong fairness is impossible

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
against half size collision

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
however in many decentralized

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
applications for example voting on

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,720
blockchain many pseudonyms may be

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
controlled by the same entity and these

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
pseudonyms will coordinate together and

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
they may deviate from the protocol to

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
gain benefit

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
it is very likely that these pseudonyms

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
form a majority-sized coalition

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
so we do need some meaningful fairness

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
notion that it's achievable against a

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
mod a majority size coalition

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
and game theoretic fairness is exactly

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
such a notion

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
that it's likely we heard that strong

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
fairness yet still meaningful and

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,000
suitable for decentralized applications

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
and ash actually the attack i just

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,280
mentioned

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
with a lot of pseudonyms is a real world

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
attack that just happens a few days ago

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
so previous work have shown that if we

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
are willing to use logging rounds we can

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
achieve perfect game theoretic fairness

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
against arbitrary sized coalition

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,159
and if we're willing to sacrifice a

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
little bit fairness by just requiring

106
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,358
approximate fairness which says okay a

107
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,918
collision cannot increase their utility

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
by too much

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
then we can tolerate a one minus small

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,880
one unsized coalition but what if we

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,520
want to achieve smaller round complexity

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
can we do smaller than lock locking

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
rounds can we still achieve meaningful

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
fairness within

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,560
small order of log lock and runs

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
in this work we give an affirmative

117
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
answer we give a lock star run a proxy

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
made game directly for a leader election

119
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
against say 0.9 incites coalition and in

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
the full talk we'll talk about how we

121
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
get this result and we'll give a fully

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,160
parametrized result

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
about the run complexity and fairness

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,919
parameter thank you
