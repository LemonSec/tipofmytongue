hi everyone this is constructive post

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,879
quantum reductions

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
assume do you have a classical reduction

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,559
between two cryptographic primitives for

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,639
example assume you have a proof by

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,480
reduction of the security of your

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
encryption scheme based on some post

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
quantum secure assumption but the

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,840
reduction is classical which means that

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
if you have an adversary against the

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
encryption scheme you can translate it

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
into an adversary for

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
the underlying assumption

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
now does having this uh reduc this

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
reduction mean that your encryption

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
scheme is quantumly secured is it secure

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,880
against the quantum adversary well at

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,480
first glance it may seem that it is the

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
case but uh in this paper we show that

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,000
we need to think a little bit more

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
carefully about what this actually means

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,079
so we want to argue that if you have a

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
quantum adversary it violates the

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
security of the encryption scheme then

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,680
you also get a quantum adversary against

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
the underlying assumption

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
but one has to be careful in the quantum

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,480
case in particular if the

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
adversary that violates the security of

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
the encryption scheme actually has an

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
internal quantum state and the reason is

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
that the internal quantum state can

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
actually change

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
once you call once you invoke this

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
attacker and therefore it's not it's not

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
even clear that you can use this

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
attacker more than once so these

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
questions this type of questions are

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
what we deal with in this paper and we

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
show some positive results so that for

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,159
some classes of reductions you actually

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,240
can infer from having a classical

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
reduction that you would also have a

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,799
quantum

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
quantum reduction or a reduction for the

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
quantum case uh in some cases we

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
actually show that there are barriers

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
even in the sort of

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
easier case of um non-interactive

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
non-interactive class of primitives so

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,439
near is going to give the talk at crypto

52
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,839
and it should be great do come
