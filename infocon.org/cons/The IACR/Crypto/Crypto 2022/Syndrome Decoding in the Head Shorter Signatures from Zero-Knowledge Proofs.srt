00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,640
hi everybody

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,879
i'm going to present you a giant war

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,200
entitlement syndrome recording in the

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,920
head shot the signatures from zero

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,679
knowledge proofs

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,920
in this war we propose a new code-based

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,840
signature scheme built from a

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,480
zero-knowledge proof

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,880
to design this signature we chose to

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,599
focus on the syndrome decoding problem

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
for which cryptanalysis is stable for

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
many years

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
then we used the emphasis paradigm to

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
build a zero knowledge proof of

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
knowledge for this problem

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,800
this paradigm provides a generic method

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
to build their own knowledge protocols

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,440
using techniques from secure multipath

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,079
computation

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,680
to apply the mps in zl paradigm we need

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
to have an efficient and pc protocol

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
that checks

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
that a vector is a solution of the

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
syndrome decoding instance

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
by checking those two relations

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
the linear relation is easy to check

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
with mpc

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
but it is much harder for the constraint

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,320
on the handling weight

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
for this reason

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
we replace the second constrainer with

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
an equivalent one involving polynomials

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,360
this new constraint consists to prove

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
the existence of a polynomial fuel such

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
that

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,799
f divides the product sq where

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,799
s is a polynomial for which the

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,840
evaluations and some public points give

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,799
the coordinates of the test vector

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
and f is the smallest polynomial for we

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
which has four roots all those

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
evaluation points

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
in practice

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
such polynomial coup can be easily built

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,640
from the tested vector

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
we simply need to take a monique

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
polynomial of degree w so that the

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,159
non-zero position of the tested vector

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
are encoding as roots

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
now that we have the exact statement we

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
want to check

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
we can use the usual techniques

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
to build the wanted

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
mpc protocol

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
then

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
we convert this protocol into an

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
interactive zero knowledge proof of

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
malay

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
using the npc in the ad paradigm

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
finally we applied the fiat charmier

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
transformation to obtain

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,920
the signature scheme

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
we selected three parameter sets

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,680
targeting a security of

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,599
128 bits

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,480
the two first sets rely on synonym

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
decoding instance on the binary field

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
while the third one relies on a single

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,599
beginning instance on a larger field

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,840
for each parameter set we proposed two

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,200
trailers the first one

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,400
lowers the communication first

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
and the second one lowers the

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
computational cost

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
let us compare our scheme with the other

76
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
code by signature grid from zero

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
knowledge proofs

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
we can observe that the obtained

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
signature size are less than for all the

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,840
former schemes

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
we are the first such schema

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
which can produce signature size along

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,879
the symbolic cup of 10 kilobytes

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,640
now

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
let us compare our schema

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
with all the other code based signatures

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
we far we are far to have the shorter

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
signature

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,239
however

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
our skip outperforms all the signatures

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
when considering the sum of the size of

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,239
the signature and the pubic

93
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,319
to conclude we proposed in this work a

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,040
new code-based signature relying on the

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
syndrome nikoning problem for random

96
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
linear codes

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
and this signature has competitive

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
performance regarding the current state

99
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,399
of the art

100
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
thank you for your attention and see you

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,600
on the 16th of august for the complete

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
talk
