00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,839
hi everyone this work is entitled

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,480
superposition meeting the middle attacks

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
update on fundamental security of aes

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,280
like hushing

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
the meet in the middle attack was

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,760
originally introduced to investigate the

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,279
security of multiple encryption schemes

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
later dynamic meeting the middle attack

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,680
was used to discuss pre-image resistance

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
of block cipher-based hash functions

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,719
later the meeting in the middle idea was

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,320
used to devise dedicated attacks on hash

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
functions

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
in dedicated

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,879
meeting the middle text on the

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,840
comprehension function typically it is

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
difficult to find a complete partition

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
of the message worship so the attacker

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,399
only found

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
two separate subside of the message

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,079
words

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,559
well all other words are fixed one can

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
split the computation into two chunks

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
each chunk can be computed over values

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,239
of one subset of the method word and

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
independently from the other subside

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
those message words in the subsets are

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,400
called neutral word the two chunks are

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
typically computed forward and backward

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,400
independently and end up at a common

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,200
state where the results can be paralyzed

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
matched

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
several advanced techniques have been

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
proposed to fund better chunk

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,840
separations and to cover more wrongs

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
in 2011 the meeting the middle pre-image

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
attack was applied to aes hashing mode

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
in the attack the neutral words are

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
directly selected from the encryption

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
state where the key states are fixed

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
using initial structure and indirect

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
indirect departure matching the tag

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
successfully covers several runs of aes

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
hashing modes

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,360
in the attack published that eurocrypt

46
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,520
2021 the meeting the middle attack was

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
generalized by removing many artificial

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
limitations and automatic search were

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,800
performed over extended attack spaces

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
the tag configuration with the phone

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
list and translate into mixed integer

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
linear programming models the searching

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
for the best attacks was reduced into

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
solving optimization problems and their

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
constraints in mlp

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
in this work we enhance this meeting the

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,760
middle mlp modeling in several ways

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
the first point is that different from

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
the common practice of that oriented

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,239
decomposition of the state we propose to

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
use the superposition state

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
that is every intermediate state is

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,959
reviewed

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
viewed as the combination of two virtual

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,239
states each virtual state carries one

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
attribute propagation through linear

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,640
operations independently of the other

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
the two virtuous data combined only when

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
going through the nonlinear operation

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
a direct advantage of this

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
representation is the preservation of

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
the linear combinations

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
it opens up the possibility of new local

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
collisions between or within the

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
encryption and the key state

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
besides it facilitates the modeling of

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
various ways of consolidations and

78
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
modeling the matching

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
the next point is allowing the bad

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
direction attribute propagation and

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,879
consolation

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
it slides the attribute be consumed and

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
preserve the opposite propagation but it

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
finally benefits the original

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,159
propagation because it might enable a

86
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,040
remote consolation of impact by the

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,959
addrent key or what they mixed column

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
besides its contribute to gun the degree

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
of matching

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
the next point is enhancing the meeting

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,920
the middle mlp model with gas and

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,720
determine which was not integrated into

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
previous meeting mlt models for

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,239
automatic search

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
the next point is dedicated to the hash

96
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,599
function whirlpool due to the identity

97
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
between its encryption and the key

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
schedule the address key can be moved

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
easily around the mixed columns using an

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,960
equivalent key state which is already

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
involved in the key schedule

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,960
moving forward or stay as it was

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,160
one choice might have advantage the

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
the other choice

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
at different roles such we integrate the

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,919
consideration of both choices into one

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
model

108
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,560
the

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
mlp models for searching for pre-image

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
resistance attack can be directly

111
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,639
transformed to search for collision

112
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,120
attacks of hash functions

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
and the key recovery attacks on block

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
ciphers

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
with the enhancements in the middle mlt

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
modeling we obtain many updates on the

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
fundamental security of aes like hash

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
functions and block ciphers

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
including the first pre-imagery attack

120
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
on seven rounds were pulled and improved

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
the pre-image and collision attacks the

122
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
angle store and the aes hashimoto and

123
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
improve the key recovery attacks on

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
takeable black saver skinny

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
thanks for your attention
