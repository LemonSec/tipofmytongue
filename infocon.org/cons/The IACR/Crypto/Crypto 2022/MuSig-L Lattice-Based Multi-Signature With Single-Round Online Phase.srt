00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,678
hello my name is akira i'm from austin

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,279
university in denmark

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,799
so in this video i'm going to give you

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,840
an overview of our crypto paper musical

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,759
that is smooth signature with single

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,360
round online place

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,960
this is a joint work with cecilia

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,359
bostini from technion and raihman

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,520
university in israel

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
and meditech from ntt in japan

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
so let's get started

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,400
so what is a multi-signature

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
so multi-signature is a generalized

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
version of the user signature scheme

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,159
where are there many different

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,239
assignments holding individually

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,120
generated secret keys

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,360
so first the parties interact with each

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
other and then after some are back and

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,399
forth

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
they produce a single signature on the

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
same message

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
then the verifier takes a list of the

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
public keys that participated in the

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
signing operation

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,879
then outputs uh rejects to accept

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
so our goal is to uh construct a lot of

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
space with signature uh using some

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,760
interactions

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
so our starting point is a chanel's

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
identification scheme

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,119
so recall that in the discrete log

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,000
setting

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
the channel prover first commits to the

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,119
randomness

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,520
and then upon receiving some challenge

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
uh the approver outputs a responsibility

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
so once you have schnoor it is known

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
that you can instantiate a lot of space

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
identification protocol

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
which is originated in the vivacious

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
key's work

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
so here the program comes to the

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
randomness but this time the randomness

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
is sampled from either gaussian or

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,840
uniform distribution over some small

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
range then upon receiving a challenge

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
now the approval has to additionally

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
perform the rejection sample

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
because the randomness is small the

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,960
potential response value z

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,560
is not independent of the secret key

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
so then the prover has to perform

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
rejection sampling and abort in some

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,039
cases

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,200
so

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
there are a lot of channel-like move

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,880
signatures

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
with different techniques

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
so for example using existing technique

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
called commit and open or trapped or uh

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
commitment

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
uh you can instantiate three round or

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
two round

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
signatures

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
in the discriminate setting and that is

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
safe

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,000
okay

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
and then the the latest works on this

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
minor research

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
music 2 and dwms

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,440
which requires only one round of

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
interaction

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
in the online phase

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
and the first round of interaction can

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
be pre-processed in offline phase

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,120
and because uh the first message that

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
the first commit message actually does

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
not uh

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
depend on the message to be signed

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
so this is a very nice feature however

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
unfortunately the security proof of

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
those existing scheme

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
rely on either

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
algebraic group model or one more

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,440
discrete log assumption

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
so uh here the main technical challenge

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,640
is

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
whether uh we can construct a scheme

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
with single round online face from

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
standard larissa assumptions

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,120
so in this work uh we answer this

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,159
question

94
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,200
positive by proposing our scheme using l

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
so uh here's the overview of our scheme

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
so if you're familiar with music 2 or

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
dwms

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
you probably see a lot of similarities

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,280
in the first

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
interaction uh each party

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
generates a lot of randomness and then

102
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
exchange many commit values

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
and then upon receiving uh some message

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
to be signed uh every party locally

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
derives a random linear combination

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
coefficient and b

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
then everybody

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,080
obtains aggregated commit message you

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
and then uh

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
continues with the user of yatchamir

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
operation

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,879
so important difference with music 2 is

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
that this rundown linear combination

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,439
follows gaussian instead of uniform

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,640
so

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
because of this you actually have to

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
modify the rejection sampling because

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
the potential value z here uh depends on

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,639
both

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
the secret signing key and the rundown

121
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,639
linear combination b

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
so you actually have to both recenter

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
the

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
response value

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
and also get rid of the dependence on

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
the the quotient p

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
so our rejection sampling analysis

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,919
actually takes care of this slightly

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,758
modified rejection sampling operation

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
so uh in this work uh we uh show that it

131
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
is feasible to construct fiat xiaomi

132
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
with about one signature with single

133
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,479
round online phase

134
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
and remarkably uh we did a security

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
proof in the classical random work model

136
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
from sis and lw

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
and we could require no one more

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,120
assumptions as in ec2 or dwms

139
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
so our proof is enabled by essentially

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
two key techniques

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
first one is our generalized version of

142
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
rejection sampling lemma

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
also we can

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
exploit the pre-image sampling algorithm

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,759
of the mechanical pi card

146
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
based on the lary structure

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
in our paper we can even if the security

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,600
proof rely on these techniques

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
additionally we also achieve

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
non-interactive key aggregation

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,479
so this allows the verifier to take just

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,199
aggregated a single public key instead

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,720
of instead of many

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
different public keys

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,479
so as a concurrent work uh flashing hub

156
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
flash hacker sim ki and zhang

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
recently proposed

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
a completely different uh that is based

159
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
non-interactive signature uh using

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
different techniques

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
also in a slightly different security

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
model

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
uh in this work we mostly focused on the

164
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
feasibility of the one round online

165
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,600
phase

166
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
using analysis

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,400
so as a future work we'd like to exploit

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
for example in true

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
so that we can minimize the overhead

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
introduced by a random linear

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
combination technique

172
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
also uh naturally we are also interested

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
in giving proof in the quantum random

174
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
model

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
