00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
hello everybody my name is rod burles

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
and this is a short video for my paper

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,359
breaking rainbow takes a weekend on a

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,040
laptop

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,519
so rainbow is a digital signature scheme

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,160
that was invented in 2005 by ding and

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
schmidt and it's a variant of the older

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,960
oil and vinegar signature scheme and

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,720
we're mostly interested in this scheme

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
because it was one of the three digital

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,800
signature finalists of the nist post

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,119
quantum crypto project

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
the other two candidates being dilithium

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,238
and falcon of course

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,719
one of the advantages of rainbow is that

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,600
it has small signatures for example 66

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
bytes for the security level one and

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
that it has good performance in terms of

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
signing time and verification time but

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,559
drawbacks are that the public keys are

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,920
quite large for example 59 kilobytes and

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
as it turns out that the scheme is not

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,719
secure

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
so why is it not secure that's what this

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
video is all about

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
this work is not the first script

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
analysis of rainbow we know about a lot

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
of attacks like when rainbow was first

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,640
proposed we knew about oil and vinegar

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
attacks and hierarchy attacks

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
and then soon after people discovered

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
two new attacks the mean rank attack and

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,159
available band separation attack

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
and

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
then after 2008

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
the the cryptanalysis situation seemed

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,119
to have

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
stabilized and there were no new

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,799
attacks found

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,360
this was until rainbow entered into the

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,439
nice competition and people started to

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,159
to look at rainbow again

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,000
and then

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
people

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
found improvements for the for the main

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
rank attacks and namely they found

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
better algorithms of solving for solving

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
the min rank problem and this translates

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
to more efficient attacks on rainbow but

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
these attacks still

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
didn't threaten the parameters that were

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
submitted to nist

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
and also

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
there was a better analysis of the

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,560
rainbow band separation attack which

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,719
reduced

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,320
it didn't improve the complexity of the

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
attack but they improved our

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
understanding of the attack

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,878
but essentially so far no new attacks

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,080
were found

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
and this changed

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
in 2021

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
when

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
i gave a simplified formulation of

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
rainbow

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
which is completely equivalent to to the

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
original rainbow scheme but

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,280
which

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
doesn't make use of bases or coordinates

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,959
it only talks about subspaces

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,160
which is

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,120
much more

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
elegant and it makes it easier to

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,519
to see what is really going on in the

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
scheme which makes it easier to find new

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
attacks of course right in this paper i

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
found two new attacks

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
that reduced the security level of

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,440
rainbow by 20 bits of security

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
but

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
the rainbow team argued that

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
rainbow had enough security margins so

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
it still met the security level one

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
security level

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
and then in this work based on the

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
simplified formulation of rainbow i

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
found another attack which is much more

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
efficient

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
and it's even

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
doable in practice for the round two

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
security level one parameters

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
and for higher security levels it also

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,959
reduces the

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,200
security level significantly

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
i'm only going to give a very high level

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
of overview of the attack so basically

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
the attack starts by guessing some

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
vector x and then you hope that some

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
event happens namely that the kernel of

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,000
the differential at x contains some some

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
vector in o2 which is a space that

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
you're interested in

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
then uh you solve some system for a

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
vector in o2

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
if you have a solution then you're happy

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
and then you can do a full key recovery

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,439
uh very efficiently

109
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
and otherwise you just try again with

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
the different guess for x

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
and it turns out that the probability

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
that you'd make a good guess is quite

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
large it's one in 15

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
and trying to solve this system takes

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
roughly two and a half hours right so

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
you have to repeat this 15 times on

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,879
average

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
which gives you

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
an efficient attack it only takes 53

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
hours or one weekend on average

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
so if you want more details then you

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
should attend the full talk but for now

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
let's move on to the conclusion

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,800
so uh rainbow is broken in practice at

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
least round two security level one

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
parameters

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
it would be possible to move to higher

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
parameters to save the scheme but this

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
would be quite expensive and this would

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
make rainbow more expensive

131
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
than the oil vinegar scheme on which

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
rainbow is based

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
this wouldn't really make sense because

134
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,199
originally the motivation of rainbow was

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
to have some more efficient version of

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
oil and vinegar

137
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
but now because of these attacks it's no

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
longer the case that rainbow is more

139
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,919
efficient

140
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,160
so we should just move back to the

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
original oil and vinegar scheme which is

142
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
much older and much simpler and easier

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
to understand and cryptanalyze

144
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
so that's it thank you very much and i

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,160
hope to see you at the full presentation
