hello i'm gregor zeiler and this is a

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
video abstract for the paper practical

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,480
sublinear proofs for r1cs from lattices

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
together with khan nuin

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
in this paper we study letter space your

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,480
knowledge proof systems for arbitrary

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
arithmetic circuits and in particular

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,760
for

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
the language r1cs that conveniently

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
describes such circuits

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
on a technical level we introduce new

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
techniques

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
for proving lattice-based commitments in

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
an amortized way efficiently

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
so this means that if one is given many

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
letters-based commitments then an

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,520
amortized proof proves all of these

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,200
commitments at the same time with the

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
total cost that is quite small so for

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
example in the best case only

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,840
logarithmic and the number of

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
commitments

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
and then we use these techniques to

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,280
construct the first practical sublinear

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
lattice-based proof system

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
and here sublinear means that the

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
proof size of our proof system scales

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
with the square root of the witness size

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,159
and in order to show that our proof

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,799
system is really practical we compare to

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
ligero which is a well-known proof

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
system that also has

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,000
square root scaling and show that for a

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
large statement our proof system

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
achieves proof sizes that are between

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,400
two and three times smaller than the

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
liga

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
this can also be seen in this table

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
um so starting from about

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
2 to the 20 constraints in r1cs

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
our proof system achieves proof sizes

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,360
that are

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
about equal to the proof's sizes uh

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,159
offered by legero but then if an

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,680
increases the number of constraints and

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,439
for example goes to two to the 28

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
constraints then we achieve this factor

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,079
of three improvement over over the gyro

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
improve size and all of these numbers

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,720
are

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,158
for equal soundless error

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,600
if you're interested then i hope

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
you watch my talk on tuesday morning and

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,840
i'm really looking forward to see all of

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,439
you in santa barbara next week
