00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,199
hi everyone i'm chipotle from simon's

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,120
institute today i will be talking about

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,040
the work on the feasibility of

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,760
unclonable encryption and more

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,480
this is joint work with prabhanjan fatih

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,040
xinjian mark

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
the talk is about using quantum

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,119
information to do some uh something

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,199
interesting about cryptography and

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
perhaps the most fascinating phenomena

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
about quantum information is the unknown

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
ability it says a piece of quantum

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
information cannot be cloned into two

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,839
identical copies

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
this so-called no cloning theorem leads

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
to a new exciting area about quantum

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
cryptography which we call unclonable

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,559
cryptography

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,640
here instead of building and analyzing

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
the security of classical scheme against

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,079
quantum computers we are interested in

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,039
what quantum computer can bring us

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
there are a line of work leveraging

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
unknown ability including quantum key

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
distribution and quantum mining

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
among those one major area is to make

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,080
classical cryptosystems unclonable

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
this security says there's no way

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
to copy a key or copy identity or even

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
cipher text this is a way of enhancing

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
the classical security even further for

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
example achieving everlasting security

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
and just like one time pad is the most

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,320
fundamental primitive to cryptography

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
one time symmetric key unclonable

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
encryption is the simplest yet most

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
important primitive we should consider

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
the question was first proposed by

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,560
gosman and study by broadband and ward

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
broadband and lore consider the

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
following security notion

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
encryption of a random message is given

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
to an adversary and this encryption is a

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
quantum state

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
the adversary attempts to produce two

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
cipher texts

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
and later on keys are revealed the

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
adversary wings if and only if both

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
copied cipher text can be used to

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
recover the original message

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
birthday and lord show that it is

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,560
actually possible either in information

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
theoretically secure way or in the

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
random or in the quantum random oracle

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,920
model

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
however this is not the optimum security

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
as it does not rule out the possibility

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
that adversary recovers non-trivial

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
information about the message for

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
example they can maybe they cannot both

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
recover the whole message but they can

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
learn the first bit of the message

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
simultaneously

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
and they identify the problem but they

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
cannot give any security proof even with

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,959
stronger assumptions like oracles

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
and in this word we show that in the

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
random oracle model the optimum security

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
can be achieved

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
the alt the optimum security is defined

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
with the cpa style that is the chosen

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
plaintext attack style

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
in this security game a pair of messages

74
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
are chosen by the adversary

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,760
an encryption of

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
one of the message m0 or m1 is given to

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,519
an adversary and it attempts to produce

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
two cipher texts

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
and later on

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
um it also

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,440
will get the keys and the adversary wins

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
if and only if it knows which messages

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
are encrypted

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,480
uh

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
uh independently using the the

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
encryption and also using the key

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
the probability should be very close to

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
half

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
intuitively it says regardless of what

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
cloning strategy is used several texts

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
can only go

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
one way that is either go the upper pass

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
or the lower pass and the other

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,238
encryption will be completely jumped

95
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,040
and this is our main theorem in the work

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
we show that there exists an unclonable

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
encryption scheme in a quantum random

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
oracle model with optimum security we

99
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,480
just mentioned before

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
and we also have other results the first

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,599
result is to justify our the use of

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,159
random oracle we will prove that

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
unclonable encryption cannot both cannot

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,519
simultaneously satisfy

105
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,680
it being information theoretically

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
secure and also being deterministic in

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,320
other words

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
to achieve the optimum security you need

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
either

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
computational assumption or you need the

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,479
scheme to be randomized

112
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
and we also show applications to copy

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
protection for point functions

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
this is everything i want to talk about

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
today please come to our talk in crypto

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,040
2022 thank you
