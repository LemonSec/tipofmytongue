hi

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,760
my name is sophia and i'm going to tell

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,520
you about statistically central part of

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,919
ladies transfer from npn and the

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,519
randomization

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
this is a joint walk with neil bitansky

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
in this work our goal is to expand the

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,680
range of the learning party with noise

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,880
hardness assumption or npn in short

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
and we hope we can contribute to the

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
ongoing research of this problem

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
it's a long study problem and it's

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
highly related to the well-known problem

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,359
of the calling random by nine indian

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,200
coins

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
it's one of the few candidates who are

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,719
considered to be resilient to quantum

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
attacks

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
and also we should keep in mind its twin

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,840
problem nwe

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,160
and generally speaking npn is far behind

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
lwe

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
both in terms of known applications we

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,320
know how to construct many more

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
applications from lwe

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
and also in terms of hardness results

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
so generally speaking we much better

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
understand we

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,640
but we also want to understand better

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
the problem of lpn

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
in this work we focus on two methods

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,720
statistically central part of legal

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,640
transfer or sspot insult

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
this is an oblivious transfer protocol

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
where we really take the round

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
complexity and the security to the

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
extreme

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
it's a two message airport protocol

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
meaning that each party is allowed to

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
send only one message

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
and we consider the best possible

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
security guarantees for such a protocol

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
meaning that the receiver choice bit is

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
kept computationally hidden while

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
the sender second

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
a message is kept statistically hidden

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
this is a very short protocol and very

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
secure and therefore it's not surprising

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,520
that it found many applications

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,159
and cryptography and especially towards

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,640
reducing the ground complexity of

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
cryptographic protocols

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,479
such as a proof system secure

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
computations

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
heart problems in statistical zero

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,880
knowledge

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,160
and more

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
the question raises up here and that we

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,319
try to answer in the paper is can we

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,080
construct statistically standard part of

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
it oblivious transfer

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
from the learning party with noise

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
assumption

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
and it turns out that generally the

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
answer to this question is yes and we

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,879
can

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,640
and in the paper we show the following

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
two results

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
so first we show that we can construct a

70
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,239
two message statistically centered

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,400
private oblivious transfer in the common

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,959
random string model using just lpn

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,280
and then show that we can actually

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
remove the crs

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
using a standard

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
nissan vigorous one's dynamitation

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
assumption

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
so overall we care that we can have an

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
ss plt protocol in the plain model using

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
lpn and the randomization

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,159
now just let me tell you a bit more

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,720
about the results

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,319
so first we should mention that there is

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,640
a caveat to our work and it is that we

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
rely on lpn in the so-called low noise

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
regime

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
but it aligns with our current

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,760
understanding of the problem of lpn

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
and i'm going to expand the

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
more about it in the talk

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
still this is the first quantum secure

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
sspot construction that is not based on

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
nwe

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,200
and we use different type proof

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
techniques from nwe

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
and we hope

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
they can be useful in the future

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
research of the problem of learning

99
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,560
parity witness

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
thank you very much for listening and

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
hope to see you in the conference
