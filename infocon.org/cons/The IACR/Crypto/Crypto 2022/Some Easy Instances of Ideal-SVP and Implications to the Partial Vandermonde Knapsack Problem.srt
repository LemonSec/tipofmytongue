00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,540
hello thanks for clicking on our little

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,759
teaser video I'm Katarina and this is

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,200
Joint work with Errol garage

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,820
the title of our paper is some Easy

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,280
instances of the ideal shortest Factor

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
problem and applications on the pattern

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
on knapsack problem in the following I

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,760
will try to highlight the contributions

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,400
in form of pictures I hope you enjoy it

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,699
and hopefully we meet at crypto

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,740
okay so let's get started with the first

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,619
part of our contribution regarding the

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,480
shortest Vector problem on ideal

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,700
lattices

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,399
to cool down a little bit in this hot

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,460
summer let's imagine that the hardness

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
of the shortest Vector problem on ideal

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,620
lattices is represented by a big frozen

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,940
lake

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,700
and in order to do cryptography we need

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,120
that the Ice is very thick it's very

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,800
hard problem

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,739
whereas in general lattices we strongly

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,800
believe that this is the case on the

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,619
whole surface in the case of ideal

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,939
lattices

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,680
this situation is a little bit different

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,740
so there have been previous works the

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,580
three holes here that show that there

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740
are specific instances

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,080
that are easy to solve

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,939
and whereas

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,640
most of the holes so the two holes that

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,360
I have on the left and on the bottom

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,500
um

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,280
uh very easy to verify in the sense that

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
if you give me an idea letters I can

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,979
easily tell you and if it falls into the

39
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,220
whole or not the situation was a little

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,159
bit more complex in the case of the

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,520
right hole or puddle

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,399
um so there have been two works by pan

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,560
and co-authors and poor Porter and

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,540
co-authors where they show that if the

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,659
ideal lattice has many symmetries then

46
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,939
the problem can be easier it's solved

47
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,399
easier so the first contribution of us

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,139
is that we generalize their results

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,720
and now it works for all number fields

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
and any ideal letters whose prime

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,300
factors are not ramified

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,760
so the puddle got a little bit hot

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,540
bigger but and I think that is even more

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,599
important is that we give very simple

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,300
conditions to verify whether an ideal

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,640
lattice falls into this hole or not so

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,180
we put this Burning warning sign here

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,239
so now people can safely walk on the

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,360
frozen lake of the ideal

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,440
sap problem

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,780
okay let's move on to the second part of

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,879
our paper

63
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,140
regarding the part of a normal website

64
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,220
problem

65
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,500
without telling you what exactly this

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,840
problem is the only thing that you need

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,319
to know for the picture is that it does

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,260
um Define a problem on ideal lattices

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,379
and so we have to put it somewhere on

70
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,518
this frozen lake

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,720
the second thing is there are different

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,319
design choices of this problem and so

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,980
um

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,980
there are actually different knapsacks

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,239
on different places on this leg and now

76
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,280
comes the second big contribution of our

77
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,980
paper is that we show that there are bad

78
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,599
instances of the part of a normal

79
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,599
website problem that exactly fall into

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,299
this hole of the

81
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,920
um that we

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,400
made bigger in our first Constitution

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,099
and here it's relevant to see that um

84
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,420
that

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,459
the fact that we made the hole bigger

86
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,519
and we had this very clear and easy

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,879
conditions to verify are necessary

88
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,340
to see that instances of the part of a

89
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,299
normal knapsack problem fall into it

90
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,000
and yeah so these were the two

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,860
contributions now I would like to finish

92
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,879
with uh some disclaimers and the first

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,120
thing is don't panic there is still much

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,819
surface on this frozen leg without any

95
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,620
holes

96
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,180
and

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,339
even if all the eyes would be gone one

98
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,699
day most let it stays cryptography in

99
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,820
particular the one that is based on ring

100
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,220
and module learning with ours would not

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,960
be impacted

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,139
so even if we would have an algorithm

103
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,820
that solves the shortest Vector problem

104
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,060
on any ideal lattice this does not give

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,259
us an algorithm that solves ring or

106
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,300
modular learning affairs

107
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,479
regarding pattern on knapsack a random

108
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,940
instance has a good chance not to fall

109
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,220
into the hole

110
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,740
and for more details check out the long

111
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,020
presentation on Tuesday or read our

112
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,120
