1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,800
hi everyone in my talk i'll be telling

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,400
you about how we build short leakage

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
resilient and non-marble secret sharing

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
schemes this is joint work with nishan

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,760
chandra and pavna kanu guruthi and sai

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
lakshmi bhabha number 2.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,759
what are secret sharing schemes there

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,960
are these really cool primitives

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
introduced by shamir and bleakly 1979

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
and here

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
bob consists of some secret s which he

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
doesn't want to store entirely at the

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
same location so instead he splits it

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,640
into n parts s1 through sn which are

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
called shares and the property that we

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
seek from such a scheme is firstly of

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
correctness which tells you that if you

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
have at least t of these shares that

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
should help bob recover the secret s

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,399
uh t particularly is some value less

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,520
than equal to n which we call threshold

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
and the second property sort is that of

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
privacy which tells you that if you

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
although have less than t shares that

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
should not give any information about

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
bob secret

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
so in other words this is captured by

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,719
saying that regardless of which secret

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,559
you pick s or s prime two distinct

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,600
secrets

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,879
the the set of less than t-shirts of s

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
looks close to the corresponding set of

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
shares for s prime

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,640
and particularly in this talk we'll be

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
in the information theoretic setup so

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
the closeness is in the sense of

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
statistical distance

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
about two decades later the uh kosher in

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,799
1996 introduced something called leakage

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,280
attacks and naturally the question is

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
what if in addition to t minus 1 shares

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,000
the adversary gets some arbitrary

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
bounded bits of leakage from the

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
remaining shares as well

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
well turns out

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
such an information could be lethal and

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,840
in fact guru swami and voter show in

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,640
2016 that the shamir secret sharing

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
scheme which is one of the widely used

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,079
secret sharing schemes in all the

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
portrait protocols um that breaks even

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
if you give one bit of leakage from all

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,840
the remaining shares besides the full

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
shares

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
so naturally that this led to the advent

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
of leakage wrestling secret sharing

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
schemes introduced by zimbabwe and

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
petrazak in 2007

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
um under the same setup with a similar

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
correctness guarantee now we seek

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
something stronger than just a privacy

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
and what we seek is called leakage

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,080
resilience

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
so instead of saying just that t minus 1

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,560
shares look close i now consider some

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
targeted function family f and let's say

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
i pick some function from this family so

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
we will come to what kind of function

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
families have been considered but if i

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
pick some function

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
instead of saying that t minus 1 shares

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
are close i want that f applied on all

73
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
these shares

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
all n shares that gives no information

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
about us

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
so just like how we captured privacy

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
this is captured by saying that for any

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,680
two distinct secrets s s prime

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
f applied on shares of s looks close

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
enough to the f applied on shares of s

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
prime

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
okay so this is the leakages lens

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,879
property sort

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,640
what is a particular family that gives

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
you an example

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,519
well this was one of the most studied

87
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,120
families since the introduction called

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
local leakage family and it is one of

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,720
the weaker leakage families introduced

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
so particularly the function family f

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,879
that we consider is this local leakage

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
family which is a non-adaptive and

93
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
independent leakage class

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,200
by which i mean that the adversary would

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
send this function f which consists of n

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
separate functions f1 through fn

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
in one shot non-adaptively and the

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
response that he gets is essentially fi

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
applied on each of the share si

100
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
so this is basically an independent

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
leakage on every share in

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
and of these n leakage responses t minus

103
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,239
1 are full shares and the remaining

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,599
would be some arbitrary function

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,400
outputting new bits from the shell

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,080
so this would be the family of interest

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
for our talk

108
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,959
however there have been several other

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,239
stronger families introduced in

110
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
literature

111
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
but common to all families or generally

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
to leakage in sharing is is this

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
question uh that stems from the fact

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
that we have known uh about swami's

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
secret sharing scheme which gives

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
optimal share size for regular secret

117
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
sharing schemes so naturally the

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
question is can we get any leakage

119
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,760
resilient secret sharing scheme um that

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
achieves this optimal share size which

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
with the leakage would be message length

122
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,238
plus mu where mu is the number of bits

123
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,120
of leakage that you give per share

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
and we answer in this work this question

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
with an affirmative yes

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
particularly our result is that for we

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
get the first information theoretic

128
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
leakages line secret sharing scheme for

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
the threshold access structure um

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,680
against the local leakage family which

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,160
allows new bits of leakage from uh from

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
the remaining shares besides the t-minus

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
one for shares and we managed to get a

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
share size of message length plus mu

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
to know more about the result come

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,280
on monday august 15th at 9 20 am roughly

138
