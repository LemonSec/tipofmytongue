00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,839
hello everyone my name is fansung today

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,080
i'm happy to introduce our work sheeran

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,160
transformation and dishonest majority

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
npc with tactical sharing this is a

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
joint work with vipalgoya and antigone

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
polychroniado

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
in this work we consider the designs

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
majority setting and information

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,439
theoretic security

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
to overcome the knowing impossibility

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
results we consider the preprocessing

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,840
model

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,159
people talk about this ice majority they

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
usually assume that all but one party

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,160
are corrupted

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
our motivation is to study an

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
intermediate case between ice majority

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
and all parts of one corruption say a

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,719
small constant fraction of parties are

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,920
honest

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
this can be motivated by the fact that

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,399
protocols that are secure against all

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
bottom line corruption are less

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
efficient than protocols in the ice

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
majority setting

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
however the requirements of ice majority

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
can be too strong to be met for

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,719
real-world applications

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
if there is no other majority but a

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,720
small constant fraction of parties are

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
honest can we speed up the protocol in

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
such a setting

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
a similar scenario in the ice majority

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
setting has been well studied in recent

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
years

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
in short when we move from the standard

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
is modality setting to the sub-optimal

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
cropping that shows we can reduce the

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
communication complexity by a factor of

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,240
n

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
in the desired majority setting the best

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
known result speed achieves out of three

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
times and elements of both preprocessing

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
data and communication

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
when moving to the sub sub-optimal

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,960
graphing setting

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,399
can we reduce the amount of

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
pre-processing data and online

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,360
communication by a factor of n just as

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,799
that in the ice majority setting

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
in this work we answer this question

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,600
affirmatively by showing an npc protocol

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,719
with overall cost out of c in both the

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
amount of resetting data and

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
communication complexity

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
our idea is to use pax equation rings to

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
evaluate a single circuit

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
we rely on two new techniques shearing

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
transformation and the sparsely packed

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,679
chemical sequestering scheme

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
confidently we consider the following

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
problem

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
given two linear sequential schemes and

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
the linear function

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,840
suppose all parties hold a sharing x of

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200
the first equation scheme with secret s

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
we want to transform it to a sharing y

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
of the second sequential scheme with

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
secret fs informally we want to

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
transform one shearing to another one

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
and apply a linear function on the

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
secret

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
shearing transformation occurs

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,560
frequently in determining npc protocols

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,920
such as doing degree reduction in vgw

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,319
and dn style protocols converting

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,640
encodings of secrets when using reverse

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
multiplication friendly embeddings

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
performing more permutations and final

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
operations for secrets of attack

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
ring

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
previous solutions achieve linear

83
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
communication in the number of parties

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
only when the same shield transformation

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
is performed multiple times

86
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
this is sufficient for the first two

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
examples since we need to perform the

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
same transformation many times

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
however for the third example each

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
different permutation or different

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
pattern of finite operation corresponds

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
to a different shearing transformation

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
the efficiency of previous solutions

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,480
degrees to being quadratic in the number

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,119
of parties

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
our work gives an efficient sharing

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
transformation protocol which can

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
perform out of n differential

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
transformations with linear amortized

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
communication complexity in the number

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
of parties

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
to achieve our results we first reduced

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
the problem to repair random shear rings

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,519
for different linear sequential schemes

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
then review the sampling process of each

106
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
sequestering scheme as a linear circuit

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
and use pexip theory to evaluate a batch

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
of sampling circuits in parallel

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
our second technique is sparsely packed

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
the your sharings

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
our idea is to use different secret

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,478
styles to store secrets in different

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,199
sharings for example here we may use

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
positions 1 3 and 5 to store secrets

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
this is different from the standard

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
texture machine rings which always use

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
positions 1 2 and 3 to store secrets

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
combining these two techniques we show

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
how to solve network clothing which is

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
the main difficulty of using tactical

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
shear rings to evaluate the single

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
circuits

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
our work also shows how to relax the

124
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,240
requirement of the field sites achieve

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
malaysia security and connect to the

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,120
standard majority setting

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
for more details about our techniques

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,199
please refer to the full video on our

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,199
paper on eprint thank you
