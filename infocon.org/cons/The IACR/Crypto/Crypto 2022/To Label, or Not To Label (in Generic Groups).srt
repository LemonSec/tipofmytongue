00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,819
this talk will be about exploring the

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,759
differences between generic group models

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,960
generic groups have been used

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,760
extensively to analyze the possibility

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,620
of new cryptographic

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,019
assumptions to prove black box and

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,120
possibilities and sometimes to justify

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,160
the security of crypto systems built

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,800
from groups given their importance it is

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
crucial to understand these models

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,019
the literature contains two generic

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,420
group models the first on the left is

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,179
truth model which uses random labels to

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,640
represent group elements

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,440
the second generic group model is

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,260
maurer's model which uses handles I like

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,120
to think of maurer's model as imposing a

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,219
strong type system dictating that the

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,500
only way an algorithm can manipulate a

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,899
group element is by group multiplication

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,300
and testing equality no other operations

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,899
are allowed

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
these two models are often treated as

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
equivalent however the purpose of this

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,180
work is to explore how they are in fact

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,640
quite different this may be surprising

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,739
but was already present either

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,080
implicitly or explicitly in several

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,299
prior Works however the exact

30
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,860
relationship and the implications of

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,420
their differences was never really

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,500
explored

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,600
this work explores the relationship more

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,360
thoroughly the high level takeaway is

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
that Shoop's model when in doubt is the

36
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,280
model to use the reason is that we find

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,799
that Mouse model fails to capture many

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,780
generic techniques to the point where

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,479
many classic textbook results do not

40
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,220
hold in maurer's model despite easily

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,439
holding in general groups

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
model on the other hand does not suffer

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
from these limitations

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,140
with that said there are some cases

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,479
where malowers and shoots model can be

46
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,460
used interchangeably which will be

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
elaborated on in the full talk

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,100
as a bonus along the way we also have

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,600
something to say about the algebra group

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,640
model which has recently received a lot

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,439
of attention please see the full talk

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,158
for details
