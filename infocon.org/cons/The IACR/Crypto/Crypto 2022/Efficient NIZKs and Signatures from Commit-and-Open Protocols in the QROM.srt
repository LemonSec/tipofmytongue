00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,480
welcome to the video abstract of our

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,280
work

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,440
efficient gnisics and signatures from

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,400
commit and open protocols in the cubro

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
my name is jealous don this is joint

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
work with cersphere christian mayans and

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,040
christian schaffner

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,119
i'll start by explaining the words in

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
the title of our paper

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
commit and open particles are a subclass

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,199
of the three-round interactive proof

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
systems also known as sigma particles

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
where in the case of committed open

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,000
protocols the proofer in the first round

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
commits to a number of messages via a

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,160
hash-based commitment scheme

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,960
which we can model as a random oracle in

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,840
order to do a security reduction

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,879
and then as a next step we may apply the

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,680
fiat chamber transformation to obtain

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
nisik's non-interactive zero-knowledge

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
proof systems

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,480
or

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,839
digital signature scheme

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
now to prove that such a scheme is

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
online extractable in the quantum random

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
oracle model

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
what we do in our work is

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
adapt an existing framework of qram

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
simulation

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
to construct an online extractor where

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,479
online means that the extractor is given

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,200
only black box access to the proofer

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
then runs it just once so no rewinding

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
while at the same time simulating the

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
random oracle in order to answer queries

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
of the proofer

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
then if the proofer is successful the

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
extractor produces a valid witness

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,400
all in such a way that the distribution

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
of the output of the proofer while

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,479
interacting with the extractor

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,680
is close to the output of a proofer in a

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
normal run

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,040
using our technique we

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
obtain a tight reduction

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,079
tight in the sense that if the attacker

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,919
has success probability epsilon

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
our extractor

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
also succeeds with probability epsilon

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,319
up to a negligible additive error term

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,440
whereas the generic reduction

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
that applies to any

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
any type of sigma protocol has a loss of

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,239
epsilon cube over q to the sixth

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,560
which in the previous work we managed to

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
reduce

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
for this specific class of commit and

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,560
open particles to just epsilon over q

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
squared

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,160
but now getting rid of the q squared

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,640
factor we obtain the first tight

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
reduction of a fiat xiaomi based nizik

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
or signature scheme in the curo

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,959
that's the main result of our work

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,680
we

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,280
further show

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,720
that this reduction also works on

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
commit and open protocols that use a

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
merkle tree for the commitment

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
that allows for a special

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,440
so-called octopus opening

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
which is just a more clever more

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
efficient way of

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
opening multiple values at the same time

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
if you want to study this in more detail

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,800
i invite you to either pause the video

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,640
or read the paper or

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
come to our talk on the at the

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
conference

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
and as another

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,159
extra result we

83
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,440
show

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
that the umru transformation which is

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
comparable to but less efficient than

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
the fiat xiaomi transformation

87
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
but it was the first music that was

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
provably secure in the q rom

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
uh it's also online extractable

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
it has the advantage that can be applied

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,239
to any sigma protocol

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,599
but the proofer has to commit to a

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
single response for every possible

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,120
challenge making it

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
quite a bit less efficient and fear

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
charmier

97
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,280
especially when the commitment scheme is

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
required to be a length reserving hash

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
function

100
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
and that's exactly the the thing that we

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
improve upon we show that this

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
requirement using our

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
reduction is no longer needed

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
so summarizing

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
we

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
managed to give the first tight cure

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
reduction of a fiat xiaomi based nizik

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
for the subclass of committed open

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
protocols

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,960
this reduction also works on merkle tree

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
based cnos with octopus openings

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
amongst other things this applies a

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
tight curom reduction for the picnic

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
signature scheme

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
and finally we give a more efficient

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,960
version of the unroot transform

117
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
thank you for listening

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
i hope to see you all at our

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
presentation which is on

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
the the tuesday slot from 1350 to 1530

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,360
in the latter liman hall thank you
