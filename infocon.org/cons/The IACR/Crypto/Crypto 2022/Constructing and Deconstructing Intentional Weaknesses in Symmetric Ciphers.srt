00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,800
hello my name is gringo lyanna and with

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,120
this video i would like to get you

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,799
interested in our work constructing and

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,360
deconstructing intentional weaknesses in

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,599
symmetric cyphers this is joint work

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,879
with christopher le timber

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
backdoors and

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
and or international intentional

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,720
weaknesses

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,240
um

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,760
the both overlapping

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
subjects is a long-standing interesting

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,960
topic and has many dimensions so it's

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
interesting for political reasons

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
it's actually deployed

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,719
in many examples

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,660
and it also

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,120
[Music]

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
is interesting from an academic point of

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,680
view with a dedicated

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,039
designs or

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
frameworks to construct

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,490
such

24
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,000
[Music]

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
backdoors or weaknesses in crypto

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,399
and the important disclaimer i want to

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,920
make is that we don't

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
think vectors are a good thing we

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
actually think it's very bad and we

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
would like to understand them better in

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
order to be able to prevent them

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,479
so in our work

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
our contribution is twofold

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
we are on the one side we are

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
deconstructing existing

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,119
uh intentional weaknesses namely we

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
explain how the ga1

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
cipher was vectored and probably how

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
this

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
has been

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
constructed this spectra which was an

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
open question and on the constructing

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
side we show

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
how to build tweakable block surface

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
respect to us and we do this in a what

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
we think is a more natural

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,880
way than before

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
so let's start with the first

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,040
topic which is

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,439
the ga1 algorithm which is an algorithm

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
which was used in previous

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
versions of gsm to encrypt

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
the data

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
between the mobile phone

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
and the antenna

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
the last

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,079
yoga paper source that this cypher has a

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
very

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,759
particular weakness namely

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,959
two registers jointly and only have two

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
to the 40 possible states after the

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
linear initialization process

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
even so they could have two to the 64

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
possible states running over all

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
possible keys so there's a high loss of

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,959
entropy

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
and

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
in this

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
picture it is shown how unlikely this

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
constellation of the loss of entropy is

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
so

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
in one out of a million tries the

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
highest entropy loss was nine bits while

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
ga one has the entropy loss of 24 bits

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
so this shows that um

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
this

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
is not a property that can happen by bad

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,160
luck but it's something

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
that

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
was and

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
was chosen on purpose and

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
in the yoga paper it was unclear how you

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,319
could do this and this graphic graphic

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
also shows that it's very hard

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
to find this even if you are searching

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,879
for it then it's just too important

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,000
expensive

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
and we saw

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,480
a technique which we believe was the

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
original way to construct these

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,640
by basically turning around the property

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,879
and starting with the entropy loss and

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
searching a particular entropy loss and

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
searching for the lfsrs or more

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
precisely for the

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,560
characteristic polynomials of the lfsrs

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
in

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
bit more clever way maybe

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,000
the second topic is constructing

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
um cyphers with

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
back to us and in this case tweakable

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
blocks fs and what we do here is we

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,319
build

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,440
upon

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,959
the malicious framework which was

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,159
presented

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
um last

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
crypto 2020

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,840
where the idea is to

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,360
use a particular m

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
tweak t zero

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,480
and hash it and use this to

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
construct

114
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
um using variants of low mc

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
and probability one differential and

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
what we do here instead of using pairs

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
of tweaks and constructing probability

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
one differentials we

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
use one tweak

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,120
and make use of invariance and so we

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
show this in two

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
parts one is melissa's aes where we make

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
use of a well-known invariant

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
that is normally destroyed by the key

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
scheduling and we modify the key

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
scheduling and add a tweak very much

127
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
like in the original malicious way to

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
have a variant of a yes

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
where for one tweak you get a very weak

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
cipher and for all the other tweaks you

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
get something which is very secure

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
you also have a different

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,199
version for this idea

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
which we call in boomslang and this

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,880
is more involved it uses a nonlinear

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
invariant over two consecutive rounds

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,240
and i think that's highly non-tribute to

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
detect in the sense that for now you

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,759
don't have tools to detect this weakness

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,880
um automatically

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
so please have a look at the paper i

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
think that's an interesting

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,479
construction

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,520
and if you want to do so then you can

145
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,759
find the people at the paper on imprint

146
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,639
and already or you you are very welcome

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,840
to contact

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
any of our authors and we are happy to

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,199
discuss

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
the paper further thank you very much

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,120
for listening
