00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,200
hello everyone i'm takashi from ntt and

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
kyoto university

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,360
this is a short abstract video for our

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
work content commitments and signatures

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,400
without warming functions this is a

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,400
joint work with tomoyuki morimai

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,199
quantum information is awesome

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
one of the most surprising applications

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,080
of quantum information in the context of

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
cryptography is the quantum key

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
distribution proposed by bennett and

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
brassard in 1984.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,079
this is the information theoretically

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
secure key exchange protocol using

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,960
quantum communication

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,879
information theoretically security

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,520
exchange is impossible in the classical

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
world so this changes the landscape of

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,000
cryptography

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,840
after the invention of quantum key

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
distribution

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
people expected that quantum

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
communication can also be used to

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
achieve information theoretical security

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,320
for other cryptographic primitives

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,280
unfortunately however it turns out that

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
information theoretical security is

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,119
impossible even with quantum

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,439
communication for many cryptographic

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
primitives including symmetric and

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
public key encryption digital signatures

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
and commitments etc

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
if information theoretical security is

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
impossible then the next natural

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
question is what is the minimal

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
assumption for these cryptographic

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
primitives with quantum communication

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
in the classical world it is known that

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
the existence of one wave functions is

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,479
the minimum assumption for essentially

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,159
any non-trivial cryptographic

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,600
functionality

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
so we would like to ask if this is the

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,840
same in quantum cryptography that is

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
our functions necessary for these

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,600
premises with quantum communication

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,040
in this work

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
we show that one-way functions may not

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,920
be needed for constructing commitment

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,159
and one-time signatures with quantum

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
communication

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
it is known that commitments imply

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,038
general multiparty computations in the

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,160
quantum setting so this means that mult

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,239
party computations may also be

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
constructed without warming functions

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
to show this we construct commitments

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
and one-time signatures based on the

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
primitive called pseudo-random quantum

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
states

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,080
which are roughly a quantum analog to

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
the random generators

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
recently grechmer showed that in

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
evidence that pseudo-random quantum

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
states do not imply the existence of

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
functions

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
more precisely he shares an oracle

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
relative to which pseudo-random quantum

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,319
states exists but bqp is equal to qma

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,720
which in particular implies that no one

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
function exists

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
combining our constructions of

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
commitment and runtime signatures from

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
through the random quantum state with

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
the result of customer we conclude that

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
there is an oracle right to which

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,879
commitments and runtime signatures exist

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
but no one function exists

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
the take our message if this work is the

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
following

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,959
one-way functions are not the minimum

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,440
assumption for quantum crypto

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
it is a fascinating future work to

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,239
identify what is the minimal assumption

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
for quantum crypto

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,879
