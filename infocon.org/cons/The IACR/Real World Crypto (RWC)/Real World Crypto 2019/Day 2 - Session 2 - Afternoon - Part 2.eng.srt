[Music]

2
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:07,470
our last speaker in this session is a

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,050
tool lies got that write an account of

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,469
the iso/iec standardization of simon and

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,469
spec

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:55,130
okay good let's discuss the elephant in

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,480
the room

8
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,880
it's been we apologized it's time to

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,210
move on

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,550
so paraphrase this is roughly what the

11
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:14,270
US head of delegation was telling the

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,270
room in Jaipur at the ISO meeting and

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,590
this was actually to discuss the

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,250
standardization of new cryptographic

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,740
algorithms so the elephant in the room

16
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,050
that he brought up and this was a moment

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,699
of quite a bit of tension was of course

18
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:36,990
duly see right which is a NSA designed

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,440
pseudo-random number generator back door

20
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,300
and from the Snowden revelations we know

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,340
that it was actually an organized

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,890
program by the NSA in order to subvert

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:53,160
sanitation efforts in November 2005

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,840
through a fast-track dual EC was

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,250
standardized even before NIST

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,009
standardized it so going back to yeah

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,539
and they call it a challenge in finis so

28
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,600
going back to the Jaipur meeting where

29
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,430
these new NSA algorithms were being

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,829
considered I mean this was the first ISO

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,470
meeting where I came and I was a bit

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,510
surprised to see this just two years

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,600
after the Snowden revelations and in

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,310
fact the friendly German delegate

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,230
pointed out to me that this u.s. head of

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,220
delegation that he won or was the same

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,640
person who introduced dual EC into ISIL

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:36,060
so these two new NSA design

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,420
cryptographic algorithms assignment and

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,790
spec these are families of block ciphers

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,250
where block ciphers are cryptographic

42
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,239
algorithms which operate by taking a key

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,880
and a plaintext

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,620
encrypting them into a ciphertext the

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,569
length of the plaintext and the

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,459
ciphertext the same it's called the

47
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,488
block size which I've listed over there

48
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,150
on the right hand side the different

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,040
block sizes

50
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,599
in the Simon respect block cipher

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,790
families alongside their key sizes so

52
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,859
block ciphers in general you call them

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,629
the working horses of cryptography their

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,730
use in modes of operation for all kinds

55
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,268
of things for encryption authentication

56
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,560
integrity even to build hash functions

57
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,209
so the quite integral to the ecosystem

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,650
so you might be wondering well okay wait

59
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,209
people are still making new block

60
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,500
ciphers you know what's what's wrong

61
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,160
with you yes why are we even discussing

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,140
this or even Triple DES well okay you

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,180
can make a very weak argument that you

64
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,220
need some diversity in the ecosystem one

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,349
box I from might not be enough but okay

66
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,900
by this time there's already in tens of

67
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,030
very good block ciphers out there

68
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,040
another reason why new block size would

69
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,019
be in the designed is because of country

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,429
preferences there's a lot of countries

71
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,379
that do not want to use algorithms which

72
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,440
are designed in the West or in the u.s.

73
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:58,569
so here's a few examples in fact China

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,380
is currently standardizing sm4 block

75
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:04,450
cipher in ISIL but actually the real

76
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,950
motivation for a lot of these new block

77
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,349
cipher designs that comes from research

78
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,730
okay so you have many new settings where

79
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,380
existing block ciphers for whatever

80
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,529
reason for whatever performance reasons

81
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,570
just don't cut it okay so new block

82
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,000
ciphers could include implementation

83
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,830
targeted ciphers you get NPC friendly

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,229
ciphers you Cypress which are better

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,669
against side-channel resistance and for

86
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,780
simply for performance and efficiency

87
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:34,240
games so this is where we are then the

88
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,690
NSA they're proposing new block ciphers

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,860
and if you look at the introduction to

90
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,889
document that they post on ePrint they

91
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,539
kind of explain their motivation as well

92
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,460
where they say in 2011 prompted by

93
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,950
potential US government requirements for

94
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,719
lightweight ciphers and concerns that

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,969
existing cryptographic solutions were

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,770
unnecessarily restrictive a team of

97
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,789
cryptographic designers was formed

98
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,099
within the information assurance

99
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:59,710
research laboratory of NSA's research

100
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,630
direct Directorate with the goal of

101
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,638
designing foundational lightweight

102
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,050
cryptographic block ciphers Simon

103
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,920
inspect emerged from that research

104
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,470
effort in 2013

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,460
okay so now we here we are these new

106
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,580
ciphers designs motivated well they

107
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,840
motivated not a question so why are they

108
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,880
coming to I so why are they trying to

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,830
standardize here so naturally I can't

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,060
read their minds I don't know what why

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,560
they really want to go after it but

112
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,460
there is a reason why people in general

113
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,420
come to ISO to standardize so take say

114
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,539
that country a decides to develop

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,970
algorithm X okay and this country B

116
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,960
doesn't like X and it blocks all

117
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,150
products containing X if both country a

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,900
and Country B are members of the World

119
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:52,179
Trade Organization the WTO well if an

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,109
algorithm X has been analyzed by iso

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,940
country a can actually appeal to WTO

122
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,160
okay so here is a statement from the

123
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,950
former director-general of the WTO to

124
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,020
key WTO agreements explicitly urged

125
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,670
regulators to base their measures on

126
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,940
relevant international standards to

127
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,500
avoid unnecessary barriers to trades

128
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,540
these agreements go as far to say that

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,460
measures that are based on relevant

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,670
international standards are assumed to

131
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:24,520
be in compliance with WTO rules okay so

132
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,800
it's maybe one reason why they want to

133
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,419
standardize of ISIL but what but still

134
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
why particularly that I saw what's you

135
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,480
know what's wrong with miss well I want

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,120
this sudden standardizing these

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,140
algorithms at NIST when in fact if you

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,850
go to an old railroad crypto it was John

139
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,610
Kelsey from Ness he gave a presentation

140
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,260
here right after the Snowden revelations

141
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,290
where he was talking about what NIST was

142
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:51,700
doing in order to you know what they

143
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,890
were doing to their processes okay there

144
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,390
he says that we will encourage the NSA

145
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,340
to bring proposed algorithms to

146
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,960
conferences and standards organization

147
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,330
right hand side I've listed to the six

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,700
steps to publication for a standard the

149
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,530
first two are the ones where experts

150
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,030
make all the decisions and the proposal

151
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,739
so they go through study periods to

152
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,260
study from algorithms they create

153
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,270
working drafts and then the working

154
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,620
draft is submitted to become a committee

155
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,330
drop and that's where the national

156
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,120
bodies can come in and it's one vote per

157
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:23,349
country okay

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,810
I so works on the basis of consensus so

159
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,300
in this case that means no sustained

160
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,290
opposition but it's purple I didn't well

161
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,480
it's a bit fake okay consensus not the

162
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,139
same as you and unanimity that's that's

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,270
for sure

164
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,550
and an important thing to keep in mind

165
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,139
is that decisions are actually made the

166
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,320
most important decisions are made at

167
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:47,320
physical meetings okay so let's have a

168
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,630
look at the timeline with Simon spec I

169
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,620
already mentioned that October 2014 it

170
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,419
was submitted that happen in Mexico okay

171
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,490
then this was every single meeting where

172
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,159
Simon spec were discussed there's

173
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,260
Malaysia India USA UAE New Zealand

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,550
Germany China okay this is a span of

175
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,169
three and a half years so if you want to

176
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,729
be part of the decision-making process

177
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,330
you better make sure to be at every

178
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,440
single one of these meetings

179
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,659
then when you come to these meetings

180
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,990
here is a list of standards that they

181
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,510
are working on this is just to

182
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,710
illustrate the wide breadth of the

183
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,940
cryptographic standards that they're

184
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,099
considering you can go anywhere from

185
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,930
modes of operation for an n-bit block

186
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,930
cipher algorithm to time stamping

187
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,789
services to prime number generation okay

188
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,710
and these standards can even have

189
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,750
multiple parts lightweight cryptography

190
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,909
to nine one nine two is the one that

191
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,979
we're looking at it has consists of six

192
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,960
parts part two is on block ciphers it

193
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:49,450
also considered hash functions Mac's etc

194
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,100
and also when you arrive there you kind

195
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,800
of you should make sure you you know you

196
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,100
can talk to talk so when you're at a

197
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,020
meeting people don't say you know okay

198
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,760
consider the standard on encryption

199
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,390
algorithms no they say

200
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,870
18 no 33 okay we're discussing 2 9 1 & 2

201
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,819
which is referenced in 2009 etc etc okay

202
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,900
so you you make sure you're on top of it

203
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,490
so let's see make a few observations on

204
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,079
this I already kind of mentioned touched

205
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,700
upon the fact that consensus is quite

206
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,220
ill-defined it's unclear when a boat

207
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,830
needed to be taken by either experts or

208
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,510
national bodies or even when a boat

209
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,130
needed to be taken or how that boat

210
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,220
should be taken this was all completely

211
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,830
undefined one positive outcome of this

212
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,740
whole assignment spec ordeal was that

213
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,990
all of this was very clearly then

214
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,519
written down as we were going through

215
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,890
all of this

216
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,640
and you probably saw you got the

217
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,110
impression or I showed you that it

218
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,110
actually takes a significant amount of

219
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,149
time and resources to properly

220
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,649
contribute to this process okay

221
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,209
you need to be at all the physical

222
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,070
meetings you need to fly everywhere you

223
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,268
need to know all the standards that are

224
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,339
happening you know understand what's

225
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,140
going on there's directorates that most

226
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,649
of time people don't read in order to

227
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,089
understand what consensus is so this

228
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,430
actually this effectively limits

229
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,769
participation and for especially for

230
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,510
academics then you know most people they

231
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,730
just participate for short periods of

232
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,740
time so there's little expertise and at

233
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,610
least the procedures this little

234
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,290
understanding now I put down their lack

235
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,060
of expertise that's not to say there

236
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,930
aren't

237
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,380
cryptographers sitting in the room there

238
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,510
there are but there's a a wide breadth

239
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,130
of cryptographic algorithms not every

240
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,750
cryptography is an expert on you know

241
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,010
prime number generator and modes of

242
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,630
operations they're not gonna be able to

243
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,270
know all they single all the algorithms

244
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,610
all the analysis on it so the lack of

245
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,439
expertise is rather than it just spread

246
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,390
very thinly okay

247
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,160
so given all the amount of resources

248
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,199
that you need to spend this you get you

249
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,939
get a handful of countries that are

250
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,180
there all the time the usual suspects

251
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,899
okay it's France Germany u.s. etc they

252
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,279
they always send people okay and then

253
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,950
they will determine what these standards

254
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:06,279
look like pretty much and then finally

255
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:10,480
now this is something that's which may

256
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:14,170
be important for ISIL but so the Sanders

257
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,490
they progress they progress as best as

258
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,829
they can okay so the default is for them

259
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,000
to go from one stage to the next so the

260
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,609
burden of proof is actually on

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,930
dissenting okay you know if you do not

262
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,029
agree with the standardization for a

263
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,189
particular algorithm you need to make

264
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,420
sure that you get everybody on board you

265
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,480
need to talk to many different people

266
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,219
you need to be able to explain clearly

267
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
why it should not be centralized because

268
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,519
otherwise it's going to be centralized

269
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,990
this is great for things if you're gonna

270
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,270
be satellites you know grains of rice

271
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,510
but maybe it's not ideal for security

272
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,490
standards okay so what are the resulting

273
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,480
difficulties well this whole process it

274
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,140
took three and a half years from start

275
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,380
to finish I was there for about two

276
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,390
years of this process don't have whose

277
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,490
other person on this presentation he was

278
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,130
there for about a year and then before

279
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,810
that there were other people as well and

280
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,880
a tip three and a half years despite

281
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,430
significant opposition at every single

282
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,040
meeting you know there were procedural

283
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,300
mistakes made it's complicated people

284
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,270
aren't there they don't really know

285
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,550
what's going on and they just happen to

286
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,720
be in favor of simon's spec progressing

287
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,060
okay

288
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,110
and I really touched upon this every

289
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,030
country needs to be approached

290
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,860
individually asking whether they're okay

291
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,140
with the sanitization of Simon spec

292
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,330
otherwise people don't even know that

293
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,470
it's happening and they tend to do

294
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:37,180
automatic approval of standards okay so

295
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,040
these were the kind of procedural

296
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,420
aspects now what is the meat of what was

297
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,469
the meat of the discussion what actually

298
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,880
happened at the meeting what okay how

299
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,490
did they actually decide whether this

300
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,730
keep sign of spec or knots okay so the

301
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,950
two main things were actually what took

302
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,020
the bulk of the time were discussions on

303
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:00,940
security okay concretely cryptanalytic

304
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:03,790
results and generic attacks so here is

305
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,620
an example of this is spec actually just

306
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,199
putting up there to show it's it's

307
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,940
actually very simple so interest well I

308
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,410
don't know this is interesting but there

309
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,140
is of course a lack of security in the

310
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,329
rationale okay the NSA is not going to

311
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,710
release their internal analysis the only

312
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,180
thing that we do release is the

313
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,210
description of the algorithms and

314
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,099
performance results now there was a as a

315
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,470
result of this whole ISO discussion they

316
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,470
did put up a document on ePrint called

317
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,440
notes on the design of simon and spec at

318
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:41,230
best this is a literature review of all

319
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,060
the public analysis okay there were many

320
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,670
publications it's such an attractive

321
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,800
target for academics okay a lot of

322
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,370
publications on the analysis of simon

323
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,380
spec which is good yeah I can't I can't

324
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,810
object to that that's you know cold hard

325
00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:00,120
facts yeah people analyzed people

326
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,119
analyzed the scheme a lot okay but

327
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,850
well I think Simon is spec but put it in

328
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,250
context okay because there was no

329
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,380
security rationale any attack was was

330
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,339
published okay and the attack was a new

331
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,990
result at that point in time a rx Cyprus

332
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,490
okay which is the type of design that

333
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:28,080
these block ciphers are roughly they're

334
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,920
generally less well understood in

335
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,830
academia

336
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,180
okay academia this the academics they

337
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,070
decided to go a different route they

338
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,649
didn't analyze a rxi furs as much

339
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,230
because they're more ad hoc requires

340
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:42,060
much more software and to analyze to

341
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,920
automate the analysis of these

342
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,540
algorithms okay so because it's

343
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,860
generally well less well understood of

344
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,849
course you're gonna get a lot more

345
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:54,420
results and then despite the fact that

346
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,580
there were countless publications crypt

347
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:03,560
analyzing some aspect is hardly any on

348
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,560
understanding the key schedule okay so

349
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:12,240
good and then finally the one thing that

350
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,390
made people quite uncomfortable with the

351
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,160
security of Simon respect was okay given

352
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,189
the fact that it's designed that people

353
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,100
aren't quite familiar with okay a rx

354
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,310
design which requires significant amount

355
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,010
of software tools they actually make

356
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,920
quite aggressive decisions on these

357
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,529
their security margins okay meaning the

358
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,610
amount of rounds within the cipher that

359
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:42,420
were that could be attacked okay so 30

360
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,430
percent security margin means that Oh a

361
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,079
country but let's say the cipher has ten

362
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,420
rounds that means that you can attack up

363
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,510
to seven out of ten okay and they're

364
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,680
saying AES was built with the 30 percent

365
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,149
security Martin so that's good enough

366
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,689
for this but it's two completely

367
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,010
different designs apples and oranges

368
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,240
many way so these were the type of

369
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,079
arguments that were taken into account

370
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,149
then there are also the generic attacks

371
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:08,699
okay so box I press always use the modes

372
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,260
of operation and Simon would use a mode

373
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,329
of operation there's limits on the

374
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,430
amount of data you can process but it

375
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,430
known as a birthday bounce okay and

376
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,320
there's a public paper it's so generally

377
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,609
a lot of proofs they take this into

378
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,090
account yeah sure

379
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,620
but in practice people haven't taken it

380
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,230
so seriously because I never thought it

381
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,280
would really mount an attack sweet

382
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,330
thirty-two so paper published at CCS

383
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,220
there they actually showed that with

384
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,660
long lived at TLS collecting connections

385
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,580
you can actually use these birthday

386
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:49,199
bound attacks to recover to recover the

387
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,820
secret of cookies basically okay so now

388
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,290
okay there again on the right hand side

389
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,740
I've listed all the block sizes and key

390
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,790
size of your assignment spec so when

391
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,410
they were initially proposed they

392
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,860
propose all of them okay you get all

393
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,630
these tiny block sizes key sizes at the

394
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,089
very least in this two nine one nine two

395
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,310
standard on lightweight cryptography

396
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,750
there was a minimum set for minimum a

397
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,399
bit security so they said all these

398
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,760
ciphers they should be at least 80 bits

399
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,430
have 80 bit security okay so that means

400
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,890
that you automatically gets okay so

401
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,570
there you've got a 64 bit key size under

402
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,070
72 kid bit key size they were never even

403
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:28,319
considered for ISO then you get this

404
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:33,360
kind of this back and forth okay April

405
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,129
2016 they're defending the 48 bit block

406
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,350
size is saying that there are really

407
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,350
situations in which you must have these

408
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,919
small block sizes okay

409
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,620
it was never it was never clear exactly

410
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,900
what those situations were but they were

411
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,729
defending them strongly and then they

412
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,310
make statements like counter mode fixes

413
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,490
birthday bond problems oh yeah

414
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,980
[Applause]

415
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,070
then in October 2016 which is the next

416
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,870
physical meeting they remove the 48 bits

417
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:04,290
block size they say okay fine we give in

418
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,419
here but we're keeping the 64 bit cipher

419
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,990
because the other light weight ciphers

420
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,450
in the standard actually have a 64 bit

421
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,070
block size then there's a sweet 32

422
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,310
attack happens and sure enough they

423
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:22,409
remove everything except for the 128-bit

424
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:24,360
block size okay so I so doesn't kind of

425
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,410
summarize but there's you can't imagine

426
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,209
the amount of discussion

427
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,840
on these stupid block sizes we had at

428
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,250
these meetings but anyway okay and then

429
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,820
there's the big back doors question

430
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,440
right

431
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,240
are there any back doors and Simon spec

432
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,380
Brian likely I don't I don't it's very

433
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,380
unlikely that there's gonna be you back

434
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,790
to it so it's funny yeah it is funny

435
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,020
where we got it so this is actual

436
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,639
statement that they made where are we

437
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,370
gonna install backdoor in the end or the

438
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,130
XOR you know it's great but okay let's

439
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,929
not there is a more serious question

440
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,490
here there's some actual research you

441
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,890
can do in these proper answers you can

442
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,770
have right is it possible in general to

443
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,600
backdoor block ciphers right it implies

444
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,220
public key encryption maybe that you can

445
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,320
get white box crypto out of here anyway

446
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,520
there's some serious research questions

447
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,620
in here I'm not saying we should put all

448
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,270
the Tim Doyle hats but let's not be anti

449
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:21,979
intellectual as well okay good and then

450
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:25,440
finally alternatives alternatives okay

451
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,110
what are we up so AES is good for the

452
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,090
vast majority of use cases okay I

453
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,469
remember again in that Jaipur meeting

454
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,020
there's actually someone from Microsoft

455
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,660
to which this openly questioned look we

456
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,280
don't ever find any situations where a s

457
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,290
is not good enough why why do we need

458
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:45,120
this the bed okay fair enough there's

459
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,700
there might still be let's keep an open

460
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,149
mind there might still be more marginal

461
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,370
situations you know RFID tags more

462
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,340
specialized situations where really AES

463
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,350
is just too big to implement okay so

464
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,120
then you already actually do have some

465
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,510
lightweight ciphers in the iso standard

466
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:09,000
present clavia and then there are one

467
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:10,470
such as Chesky le a rc5 okay so they're

468
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,210
basically there's a lot of different

469
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,950
ciphers out there and the reason I'm

470
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,600
pointing that out is because during this

471
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,310
whole consideration we were just looking

472
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,110
at Simon in spec we you're not taking

473
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,760
the whole ecosystem in the counts all

474
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,639
the different ciphers not comparing them

475
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,500
one to the other okay

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,270
if you're uncomfortable with the fact

477
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,310
that key schedule schedules are poorly

478
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,840
understood maybe you should use

479
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,399
permutation based crypto where there

480
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,939
aren't any key schedules or very simple

481
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,440
key schedules okay but permutation based

482
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,610
crypto except for in hash functions

483
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,299
never considered in I saw right Simon

484
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,549
respect

485
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,809
just conventional block ciphers really

486
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,459
we should be building tweakable block

487
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,440
cipher it's much more useful for modes

488
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:51,629
of operation because they avoid birthday

489
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,229
bond attacks and that's why it's so

490
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:57,168
great that they well yeah I hope that

491
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:59,429
they get funding but this lightweight

492
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,769
cryptography competition is good right

493
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:03,269
because it's complicated there's a lot

494
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,249
of things to consider over here should

495
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,679
we really be putting new cryptographic

496
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:09,299
I'll algorithms into ISO so that they

497
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,219
could be considered into isolation we in

498
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:15,929
place where people are stretched thinly

499
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:19,219
so there's summarize and this is I'm

500
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:22,349
quoting from the document that's WG to

501
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:23,669
publish once they removed Simon spec so

502
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,109
the working group to feels that both

503
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,579
algorithms included in the amendments

504
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:28,139
are not properly motivated and the

505
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,749
security property properties are not

506
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:32,309
sufficiently understood they're not

507
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,229
making statement about the security

508
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,668
quality of the algorithms nor about the

509
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:38,369
work done by the designers nor the

510
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,349
editors given the available information

511
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:42,269
and the opposing opinions about the

512
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,218
security of the algorithms so I'm

513
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,169
inspecting do not enjoy the level of

514
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:51,989
confidence required for inclusion in the

515
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:54,269
ISO standards so this picture over here

516
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:55,979
I just kind of put it up there because I

517
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:58,619
thought it was interesting to see the

518
00:21:55,979 --> 00:22:02,129
contrast so that's a protest organized

519
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:05,879
against well there was another

520
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:07,309
controversial situation in JTC one where

521
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:10,289
Microsoft was trying to standardize

522
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,639
their Word documents okay and this is

523
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,070
the amount of passion that people showed

524
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:15,869
I just thought it was interesting to

525
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,399
contrast that with the amount of apathy

526
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,238
I actually saw throughout this entire

527
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:20,549
process

528
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:22,469
alright so conclusions there's there's

529
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:25,979
been a complete erosion of trust with

530
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:28,109
respect to the NSA we really I mean I'd

531
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:30,719
expect them to kind of rebuild that

532
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:34,079
bridge if they really want to but based

533
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:37,259
on the talk about Capitol Hill the other

534
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,289
day I doubt that'll be the case there

535
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,209
was for our ISO at least there was

536
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,190
there's a lack of necessity lack of

537
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:46,079
pressing need ok this was these were

538
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,499
truly unique algorithms maybe they

539
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,210
wouldn't have been removed and it takes

540
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:53,489
time to rebuild these things right

541
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,930
Rossano trust and building up necessity

542
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:57,450
that's why

543
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,880
you know I so maybe is the best place

544
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:03,690
for to sanitize cryptographic algorithms

545
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,080
where it's been deployed okay

546
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,230
and it's it's has some time for people

547
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,580
to look at it but perhaps for new

548
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,560
cryptographic colors we should really be

549
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:23,850
focusing on these competitions yeah

550
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:25,590
thank you for your time okay it

551
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,639
officially is time for the coffee break

552
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:32,209
but I think we can take one or two

553
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:36,120
questions hello yes quick question on

554
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,820
improving B notices that when the

555
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,800
attacks on 32-bit was made they

556
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,100
immediately removed 32 bits they removed

557
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,600
64 30 removed so they all of those yes

558
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,219
those those lines maister they wrote

559
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,840
them off and they what about if

560
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,780
something similar to the birthday attack

561
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,120
was formed or would they have had enough

562
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,399
time to or would they have been given

563
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,290
the time to improve upon the algorithm

564
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,280
make it say tweakable and then resubmit

565
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,290
oh yeah I mean they could be submitted

566
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,470
right now they can keep they can keep

567
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:15,899
resubmitting as much as they want yeah

568
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:17,730
thank you hello I'm Rob Campbell I'm

569
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,720
from the evil empire that's not

570
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:23,820
Microsoft i from NSA I'm not a part of

571
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,800
the Simon aspect design team but I have

572
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,570
to sit in the same cube with most of

573
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,120
them okay and so I put up with the

574
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,010
gripes I understand so I'm gonna inspect

575
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,590
believe it or not we're supposed to be

576
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:37,410
part of NSA's attempt to rebuild a trust

577
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,300
I think maybe this was just not the

578
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,690
right time for the ISO standardization

579
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,710
we will continue to use them actually

580
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,730
you've answered a lot of your questions

581
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:50,310
in your own slides and one of the

582
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,800
reasons we went to ISO was we had a

583
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,980
customer the one you called logistics

584
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,169
group who wanted RFID and lightwei

585
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,110
crypto in it obviously and certainly at

586
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,780
the time we got started there really

587
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,060
wasn't something there

588
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,250
mm-hmm so we are in the business of

589
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,120
designing what's needed for the US

590
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,310
Defense Department

591
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,280
we designed what's needed and because

592
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,770
they for whatever reason decided it had

593
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,060
to be run through a standard it ran

594
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,879
through a standard and I think you

595
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:23,480
mentioned the RFID standard I think yes

596
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,280
I'm not sure 331 yeah I I do my best to

597
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,940
ignore them from time to time when they

598
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,980
get going I think it actually isn't the

599
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,690
standard so we've got our 90 percent

600
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,590
solution we're going to be using it in

601
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,300
various internal applications which I'm

602
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:42,409
not going to talk about okay sorry

603
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:47,030
and we've got our logistics folks happy

604
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:49,550
and more to the point yes a rx is a

605
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,580
fairly new architecture that's that's

606
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,250
back Jesus I wish they would didn't both

607
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,659
start with s I'm constantly screwing it

608
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:03,260
up but it's not that new

609
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,580
well absolutely zaza is a rxf I think

610
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,590
people have really grown in their

611
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,629
understanding of it there was initial

612
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,370
complaints that these are unanalyzed but

613
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,990
now they're sufficiently analyzable if

614
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,439
that I think there was even one paper

615
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,420
saying ah we've got better

616
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,800
rotations than yours which not be true

617
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,170
but I don't think about mine and that's

618
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,669
to give credit that's also obviously

619
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,470
thanks a Simon spec that people have

620
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:27,010
really started putting a lot more so I

621
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,450
would encourage folks to keep looking at

622
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,930
make use of them if you don't like our

623
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,580
rotations put different rotations in you

624
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,630
they're pretty robust designs you're

625
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,040
probably not going to damage the

626
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,010
security much right now

627
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,070
changing them a little bit so can I ask

628
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,540
you one question yes so there was I did

629
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,560
notice throughout this entire process

630
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:51,590
that so the people were very passionate

631
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,110
so they're people who know her from

632
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,879
being from the NSA I don't know

633
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,429
I was not there that day okay yeah but I

634
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,190
was quite surprised the things of

635
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:10,460
statement so a lot of cryptanalysis by

636
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:12,080
Twitter and that can't be productive you

637
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,330
see more of us hopefully we will

638
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,389
continue to rebuild yeah let's go so

639
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,370
sorry Thank You sorry I tried to phrase

640
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:30,470
this as a question but despite years of

641
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:32,239
watching jeopardy I just okay not so any

642
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,520
other questions for this beaker

643
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,450
Nigel's got a question okay I guess he's

644
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,670
gonna take my mic again your story you

645
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,040
was about you know like karma tried to

646
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,800
rebuild trust in the NSA but I heard

647
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,480
your story as much more as surely I so

648
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:58,040
needs to rebuild trust because it's a

649
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:58,670
 show of a status organize all right

650
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,899
with that

651
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:06,290
let's there's nothing further let's

652
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,680
think hmm let's thank Atul let's thank

653
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,840
all the speakers and let's also remember

654
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,520
the folks from NIST who were supposed to

655
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,080
be here and we're willing to come and

656
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,910
are unable to and let's thank them too

657
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,668
okay see you at four o'clock

658
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,669
[Applause]
