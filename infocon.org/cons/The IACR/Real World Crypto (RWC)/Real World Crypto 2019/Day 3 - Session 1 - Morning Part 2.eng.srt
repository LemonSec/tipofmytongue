1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,350
okay okay we'll start the next session

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,750
which is about advanced cryptographic

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,559
primitives to distinguish it from

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,880
primitive cryptographic primitives the

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:20,039
first talk is by malian arachova on

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,359
advanced cryptography on the way to

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,240
practice thank you good morning so today

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,830
I'm going to advocate that it's time

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,830
that some of the advanced cryptographic

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,540
techniques that we have been developing

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,420
also be put on the map of practical

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,489
cryptography so in the first question of

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,309
course is what is the definition of

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,589
advanced cryptography so the for the

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,050
purposes of my talk this would be

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,719
anything can you primitives and

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,059
techniques that look beyond the security

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,000
of data at rest and communication

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,769
channels and for this we have been using

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,710
techniques such as encryption and

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,809
digital signatures so we will be

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,789
interested in other types of techniques

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,559
from cryptography more specifically

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,380
techniques that are looking at the

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,810
protection of computation on sensitive

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,699
inputs so the type of functionalities

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,280
that we will be interested will be

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,619
giving us the ability to have multiple

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,630
participants that have private inputs

30
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,580
and we would like to be able to compute

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,280
some specific functionality from their

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,320
inputs while protecting the privacy of

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,850
these inputs and of course we would like

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,059
to be able to achieve this without

35
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,908
having this magic hat but rather and any

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,729
trusted party in the system and in this

37
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,409
talks I will touch on three types of

38
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,650
such advanced cryptographic primitives

39
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,329
which include multi-party computation

40
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,720
differential privacy and zero knowledge

41
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,610
proof so when I think about the

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,189
development of cryptographic research it

43
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,170
has constantly interrupting introducing

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,020
new techniques and new functionalities

45
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,020
but at the same time the adoption and

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,270
practice have been limited to for a long

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,250
time on very narrow part of these

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,020
cryptographic primitives and more

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,659
specifically focused on these data

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,389
protection primitives only in the last

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,050
couple of years we have seen companies

52
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,910
both big companies and small startups

53
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,640
starting to tap into these more advanced

54
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,500
cryptographic primitives and I'm hopeful

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,149
that in the future we will increase the

56
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,040
rate of adoption of this much more

57
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,140
powerful cryptographic techniques and in

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,549
this talk I will overview for you some

59
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,420
of the development in these three areas

60
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,880
that kind of give me this hope and I

61
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,950
should also first tell you that my

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,780
inspiration for this talk came by

63
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,899
listening to the invited talk of Chaka

64
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,120
levy at CCS this year where he made the

65
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,330
statement that advanced cryptography is

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,870
needed fast enough to be useful and also

67
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,490
not generally usable yet so in this talk

68
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,260
I will give you my perspective of this

69
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,610
question and I would like to start by

70
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,980
saying that when we think about

71
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,620
efficiency this should always be coupled

72
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,170
with utility and they're often not

73
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,090
Universal measures for efficiency it's

74
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,339
always good to be fast but sometimes

75
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,350
communication is the limiting factor

76
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,600
because this is a shared resource

77
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,000
bandwidth shared resource and we have to

78
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,739
compete for it in different settings we

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,020
might have incentive to do some pre

80
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,450
computation and sometimes the

81
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,480
participants in our protocols have

82
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,269
different assymetric resources that we

83
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,920
have to be careful about and also there

84
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,720
are many settings where we can really

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,200
make meaningful trade-offs between

86
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,550
efficiency and utility and also some of

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,850
the example that I'll be talking about

88
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,610
in this talk will be inspired from what

89
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,320
I saw in a privacy preserving machine

90
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:47,239
learning workshop that we organized with

91
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,820
Europe's in December so let me start

92
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,640
with the need for advanced cryptography

93
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,250
I think we all agree that nowadays data

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,440
is one of the most valuable resources we

95
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,910
like to gather a lot of data and analyze

96
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,910
it would like to build machine learning

97
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,239
models and then use them to predict and

98
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,390
target and one of the properties is that

99
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,959
often times the value comes in settings

100
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,839
where we are putting together private

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,780
data sets that are coming from multiple

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,709
sources so this inevitably brings

103
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:24,440
challenges when it comes to data use

104
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,590
having private data is inherently like

105
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,480
ability you have to be careful about

106
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,419
internal and external adversaries about

107
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,580
being subpoenaed for your data

108
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,800
there are many regulations that also

109
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,229
restrict the use of private data and

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,150
sharing of private data and if you are

111
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,490
not careful with your algorithms you

112
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,880
also they also might become source of

113
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,830
discrimination so in this context

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,810
privacy preserving computation brings

115
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,479
the promise that we can get utility

116
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,330
without sacrificing the privacy of our

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,940
data so we can reduce liability we can

118
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,849
enable new services for analysis that

119
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:06,200
were not possible before and we can also

120
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:09,170
have better user protection so in my

121
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,400
talk I will focus on two scenarios and

122
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,560
give you techniques that have been

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,239
developed for two scenarios that I think

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,430
are indicative for many of the practical

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,400
applications where we are thinking about

126
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,910
privacy preserving computation the first

127
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,109
scenario considers several

128
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,200
computationally powerful participants

129
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,480
that are connected and available to

130
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,159
participate in our protocols and this

131
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,660
model settings where we have several

132
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,490
companies for example that are

133
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,720
interacting and wanting to compute

134
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,200
something that depends on their

135
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,850
distributed resources the second

136
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,140
scenario is named federated learning and

137
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,470
considers the setting where we have one

138
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,810
powerful computation party and then we

139
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,690
have many weak devices that can talk

140
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,540
only to this one computational parties

141
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,669
and these devices have limited resources

142
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,840
and also may drop out during the

143
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:05,150
execution of our protocols so let's

144
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,070
start first with the first scenario and

145
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,979
look at some techniques that have been

146
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,140
developed in cryptography to facilitate

147
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,320
privacy preserving computation and this

148
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,719
setting and the first example that I

149
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,480
will give you is the functionality of

150
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,490
private set intersection which asks the

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,919
question if we have to input parties

152
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,660
that have two input sets how can we

153
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,789
compute the intersection of the sets

154
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,090
without revealing anything more about

155
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:34,789
the inputs so this simple functionality

156
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,979
has been useful in many settings where

157
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,510
we have for example two hospitals that

158
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,340
want to

159
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,289
they're common patients or we were we

160
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,349
have the list of terrorists and then a

161
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,480
list of passengers on a flight and we

162
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,400
want to find the intersection and this

163
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,740
problem has been widely studied in

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,810
cryptography we have had many solutions

165
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,600
developed and here I want to show you

166
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,910
the efficiency of the currently most

167
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,730
advanced techniques and here in the

168
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,890
setting we consider two adversarial

169
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,510
models in one of them the weaker one is

170
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,940
called semi honest where you assume that

171
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,130
parties behave as prescribed by the

172
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,870
protocol and the other one is malicious

173
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,840
that allows the participants to

174
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,170
arbitrarily deviate from your protocol

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,580
so the current state of DRA tells us

176
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,650
that we can achieve private set

177
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,440
intersection for sets of over a million

178
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,320
elements in the semi honest case in

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,640
under 10 seconds and in the malicious

180
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,630
case in about an hour so one application

181
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,969
of a related problem called private

182
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:42,940
intersection some is also used by Google

183
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:45,100
for aggregate at attribution another

184
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,719
example that I would like to discuss is

185
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,850
called private information retrieval

186
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,980
where we have one server that contains

187
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,140
that has a database and then we want to

188
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,510
enable a client to retrieve one record

189
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,030
from this database without revealing

190
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,390
what exactly is being retrieved because

191
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,039
maybe the selected record depends on

192
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,990
some private information some health

193
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,020
information or some preferences that we

194
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,020
want to hide from the server the

195
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,250
solutions for this problem leverage

196
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,960
powerful cryptographic primitive which

197
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,090
is called homomorphic encryption and

198
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,340
which allows us to compute on encrypted

199
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,409
data and I chose to show you this

200
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,090
example because this showcases the

201
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,000
current efficiency of who morphic

202
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,190
encryption techniques and what we are

203
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,720
able to do today is we were able to run

204
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,049
private information retrieval on

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,200
databases of size over 4 million where

206
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:38,919
the data items are of size 288 bytes in

207
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,020
about 12 seconds so this there this

208
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,760
shows the immense advancement in the

209
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,990
techniques for whom Orphic encryption as

210
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,510
well and certainly we would like to also

211
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,310
look at the question of general to party

212
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,800
computation that allows us to compete

213
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,359
any function that depends on the inputs

214
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,609
of two parties without revealing

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,709
anything more about their inputs and

216
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,569
there has been a tremendous amount of

217
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,839
works that have developed general

218
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:06,279
computation frameworks and oftentimes

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,399
the functionality that's used to

220
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:12,069
benchmark such implementation is secure

221
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,529
computation for AES where one party has

222
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:17,229
the key one party has the input and I

223
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,870
have selected here a few representative

224
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,610
works there are many many more just to

225
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,439
demonstrate the improvement in

226
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,170
efficiency in these protocols over the

227
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:28,329
past twenty years so we have seen

228
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,479
multiple orders of magnitude improvement

229
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:33,579
in the computation time starting in the

230
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,529
beginning with needing hours in the semi

231
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,959
honest case and more than a day in the

232
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,420
malicious case and nowadays we can run

233
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,300
secure AES in the semi honest case under

234
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,930
one millisecond and in the militias we

235
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,199
need about six point a six milliseconds

236
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,719
so that's another very impressive

237
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:56,620
development in general secure

238
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,629
computation and as I promised to you

239
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,240
some of the examples that I want to

240
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,769
cover here are coming from privacy

241
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,800
preserving machine learning which is

242
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:10,149
another area that I think is a very high

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,479
use of such techniques and here I want

244
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,029
to start with the statement that if you

245
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,379
want to get the most efficient

246
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,420
approaches for a privacy preserving

247
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:22,480
machine learning probably out of the box

248
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,899
use of secure computation techniques is

249
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,819
not the right approach oftentimes we

250
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,699
need to make the machine learning

251
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:33,729
algorithms and PC friendly and what do I

252
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:36,300
need what do I mean by this for example

253
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,319
most machine learning algorithms are

254
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,990
expecting to use floating point

255
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,819
computation and when it comes to secure

256
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:47,009
computation this is very very expensive

257
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:49,689
so many approaches have been trying to

258
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:52,779
redesign these algorithms to be able to

259
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:55,089
work with fixed point arithmetic also

260
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,579
some nonlinear functionalities that come

261
00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:00,069
from ml are very expensive in secure

262
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:02,290
computation so people have been coming

263
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:05,219
up with efficient approximation such as

264
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,660
approximation for the real off function

265
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,490
also we can go from the other direction

266
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,709
where we'll be optimizing secure

267
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,320
computation techniques for machine

268
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,870
learning algorithms in particular we can

269
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,330
come up with specialized primitives that

270
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,330
are targeted at widely used

271
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,740
functionalities such as matrix

272
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,610
computation and machine learning or we

273
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,990
can build NPC protocols that exploit the

274
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,060
fact that we'll be interested only in

275
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,210
approximate computation and we have some

276
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,689
examples for example approximate fhe

277
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,150
constructions also machine learning is

278
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,160
the place where we can really trade-off

279
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,280
between accuracy and efficiency

280
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,949
especially regression type of algorithms

281
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,980
that have this iterative nature where we

282
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,080
can really choose what level of accuracy

283
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,560
we need and what pricing efficiency we

284
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,310
want to pay so and one last point is

285
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,719
that sparsity is really matters in

286
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,109
machine learning can there have been

287
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,400
developed a lot of computational

288
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,560
approaches that for example are

289
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,709
specified in the sparse blas standard

290
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,380
interface that aim to leverage sparsity

291
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,330
and we can try to translate this also in

292
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,420
the machine learning in a secure

293
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,340
computation techniques so let's look at

294
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,589
some examples from what has been done in

295
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,970
this area and the first example is

296
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,920
privacy-preserving

297
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,200
computation for distributed linear

298
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,479
regression so the setting here is that

299
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,400
we have a database and this database is

300
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,680
vertically partitioned between multiple

301
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,650
parties and the goal is to compute a

302
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,170
linear model using secure computation on

303
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,300
this data so in a work with several

304
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,719
co-authors we looked at this question

305
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,790
and the main technique that we used to

306
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,830
compute these linear models is solving a

307
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,050
system of linear equations so we

308
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,670
considered multiple ways to solve the

309
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,640
systems of linear equations and secure

310
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,829
computation and we found out that up an

311
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,140
approach based on conjugate gradient

312
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,690
descent that allows us to really

313
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,510
trade-off accuracy and efficiency seem

314
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,030
to be the best performant and for this

315
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,270
purpose we also needed to come up with a

316
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,640
variant of this algorithm that works

317
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,920
well with the fixed point arithmetic so

318
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,139
what we observed is that if we run CJD

319
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,060
only for 20 cents which means that we

320
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:25,149
don't have to go to convergence of this

321
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,670
algorithm we already get the error that

322
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,790
we also get from exact solutions and

323
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,769
this also allows us to improve on the

324
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,410
efficiency compared with the computation

325
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,240
of the exact solution in secure

326
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,760
computation and we can run this in a

327
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,649
couple of hundreds of seconds just as a

328
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,500
reference point running the whole

329
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,480
computation of the linear learning the

330
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,120
linear regression model on five hundred

331
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,279
thousand records depending on the number

332
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,250
of attributes from twenty attributes it

333
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,410
takes about 15 seconds and going to 500

334
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:01,029
attributes it takes about two hours to

335
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:04,209
compute the ML model and of course when

336
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,310
we talk about ml we have to look at

337
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,829
neural networks so here is an example

338
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,109
where we have two parties one of the

339
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:13,779
parties has a convolutional neural

340
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,190
network model and the other party has an

341
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,230
input that needs to be classified

342
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,160
according to the model in a secure

343
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,680
manner so here I will give you an

344
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,670
example from a work from UNIX this year

345
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,170
that proposed a hybrid approach between

346
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,110
fully homomorphic encryption and garbled

347
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,060
circuits and they evaluated their

348
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,610
solution on the amnesty data set that

349
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,500
contains images and the goal is to

350
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,829
classify this image as a particular

351
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,540
digit so they explored several CN &

352
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,510
topologies and all of their solutions

353
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,790
ended up running in less than a second

354
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,529
and their major distinguishing factor

355
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,329
was how much communication they needed

356
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:55,029
which depended on how much garbage

357
00:14:52,329 --> 00:15:00,279
circuits versus fhe the approach was

358
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:02,290
using and as I mentioned sparsity is

359
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,199
often very important in machine learning

360
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,510
so that's why we developed a framework

361
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,430
that proposes secure computation

362
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,709
techniques that leverage sparsity for

363
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,500
machine learning algorithms and we try

364
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,018
to emulate the components of general

365
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,880
architectures for scientific computing

366
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,040
which propose different layers of

367
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,500
abstractions starting from a layer

368
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,719
that's accessing memory going to a layer

369
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,550
that does linear algebra and then the

370
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,160
application layers that build on top of

371
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,510
it so we developed all of this primitive

372
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,800
started for

373
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:38,200
use of sparse data and proposing this

374
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,120
layered architecture on which you can

375
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,990
kind of obliviously implement

376
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,130
applications on top of them so just for

377
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,780
purposes of comparison we run

378
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,330
computation of logistic regression

379
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,709
training using sparse data and we

380
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,500
compare it with the state-of-the-art

381
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:00,040
which is the secure ml paper from

382
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,130
security and privacy 2017 and we showed

383
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,760
that by leveraging private sparsity in

384
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,970
the input data we can achieve to times

385
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,700
improve of two to five times improvement

386
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,710
on the times for running the secure

387
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:20,140
computation depending on the input

388
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:22,720
sparsity so next let's move to the other

389
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,569
scenario that I described to you which

390
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,490
is federated learning where we have this

391
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:31,270
start communication with one powerful

392
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:34,840
and then weak devices so in the setting

393
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,030
one applications if scenario is secure

394
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:44,350
aggregation where the goal is to have

395
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:48,040
each of the devices yes don't make me

396
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,800
scared so the goal here is to have each

397
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,459
of the devices compute a local model and

398
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,380
then use some aggregation algorithm to

399
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,890
aggregate the parameters from the local

400
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,170
models and obtain a global model that

401
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,680
depends on the input of all participants

402
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:08,560
so there's a word from Google from 2017

403
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,680
that implemented such an algorithm and

404
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,958
it showed how its efficiency scales with

405
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,030
the number of small devices that are

406
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,300
participating and with the length of the

407
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,190
vectors that model the parameters so you

408
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,750
can see that even if you have 500

409
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:28,209
thousand even if you have 500 clients

410
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,190
and the length of the vectors is 500,000

411
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,050
the protocol still runs in a few seconds

412
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:37,870
and seamlessly handles drop out of the

413
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,870
parties in the protocol you could also

414
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,330
consider the same question but with a

415
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,229
little bit different architecture where

416
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,539
instead of

417
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,210
you have multiple servers that help you

418
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,549
do this processing and also add the

419
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,649
additions that each party apart from its

420
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:56,740
small device apart from contributing its

421
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:58,629
input also gives a proof of its validity

422
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,240
for example proving that it's within a

423
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,200
range so there is a very nice work from

424
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,149
Stanford from this year that implemented

425
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,399
such a protocol and this protocol is

426
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:13,209
actually being deployed in Firefox and

427
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:15,789
here is an example for the overhead that

428
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,639
this solution brings in terms of the

429
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:20,830
slowdown of the throughput that can be

430
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,199
handled by the server's and you can see

431
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,330
that this is the case of training D

432
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,399
dimensional square regression so

433
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,699
depending on the dimension the slowdown

434
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,709
goes from five point six times to eleven

435
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,019
point six times but just you're able to

436
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:41,260
handle between one thousand two and two

437
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:43,659
thousand requests per second so now that

438
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,090
we have looked at these settings of

439
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:48,250
computing aggregated functionalities we

440
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,658
can also ask a different question now

441
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,429
that we have the output of this

442
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:53,649
aggregated functionality does this

443
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:56,799
output reveal anything about individuals

444
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:58,510
who are contributing data and here we

445
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,580
meet the notion of differential privacy

446
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,639
which exactly tries to construct

447
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:07,269
algorithms that give us such type of

448
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:10,600
guarantees and there are two main

449
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:13,419
scenarios for which differential privacy

450
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,090
can be defined one of them is called the

451
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:18,850
central model which assumes that we have

452
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,149
a trusted aggregator that has access to

453
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,699
all the private inputs coming from the

454
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:27,100
individual contributors and this trusted

455
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,500
aggregator computes aggregated functions

456
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,570
and releases them and the goal is to

457
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,210
argue that this output of the aggregated

458
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,639
functions do not review an individual

459
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,090
data and differential privacy develops

460
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:42,490
this mechanism that captured this

461
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,860
intuitive notion by saying that the

462
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,080
output of this aggregator function on

463
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,510
neighboring databases that depend that

464
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,519
differ only on a single record will be

465
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,639
close and this closeness is

466
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,889
parameterised by a parameter epsilon

467
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,939
that will be used to trade-off between

468
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,820
privacy

469
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,490
utility in these mechanisms the other

470
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,950
model for differential privacy which is

471
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,230
called the local model no longer assumes

472
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,440
distrusted aggregator in this setting

473
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,779
each party has to locally randomize its

474
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,879
input before sending it to the untrusted

475
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,429
aggregator and we want to maintain the

476
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:21,070
same type of privacy guarantees with

477
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,340
respect to the individual contributors

478
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,158
and as you can see this setting a flock

479
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,709
of the local model matches much better

480
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,370
the setting of federated learning where

481
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,110
our central server is also our adversary

482
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,658
from which we want to hide the privacy

483
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:40,860
of the individuals contributing their

484
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:43,450
inputs so there has been a lot of work

485
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,428
developing general differential privacy

486
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,980
mechanisms in the central model as well

487
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,950
as specialized methods for particular

488
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,500
functionalities of interest but since

489
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,389
the local model has been more relevant

490
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,149
in this setting of federated learning

491
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:59,740
this has been where some of the

492
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:02,229
companies have been looking at and

493
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,049
Google and Apple have been leveraging

494
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:08,049
some local differential privacy

495
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,690
techniques in order to aggregate to

496
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,908
collect aggregate statistics and the

497
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,460
challenge really here is to achieve good

498
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,679
trade-off between utility and privacy

499
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,259
because in general in local differential

500
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,240
privacy we need to have more noise to

501
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:25,600
protect privacy compared to the central

502
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,519
model and this framework that came from

503
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,269
Google which is called rapport has

504
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,710
turned to be the main example to compare

505
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:36,100
against when you are developing new

506
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,350
local differential privacy techniques

507
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,428
and in the next two examples that I will

508
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:44,049
show you we have seen some work that

509
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:50,970
improves on what has been achieved by a

510
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:55,090
rapport so this first example comes from

511
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:57,309
Europe and 2017 and has developed an

512
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,870
algorithm that detects heavy-hitters

513
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,500
using local differential privacy and

514
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:07,090
this the result in this work improved

515
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,679
the total work that needs to be done by

516
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,559
the server while meeting

517
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,659
worse-case error that has been proven in

518
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:17,019
these models and as you can see from

519
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:20,499
this result you can see comparisons

520
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:22,619
between the estimated frequencies using

521
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:25,779
this algorithm compared to the exact

522
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:28,449
frequencies in a data set of 10 million

523
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,999
samples with about 26 thousand unique

524
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,490
words and you can see that smaller

525
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:36,220
values for epsilon will mean more

526
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,259
privacy and we expect that then this is

527
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,789
where we'll have more error in terms of

528
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:42,580
the utilities and you can see that this

529
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:48,360
algorithm performs quite well for

530
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:51,610
counting the heavy hitters for different

531
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,799
going from the most frequent items even

532
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:57,610
also in the setting of the less frequent

533
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:59,200
items and the main comparison against

534
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,748
rapport really comes when you are

535
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,909
looking at the least frequent less

536
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:09,789
frequent items where this new algorithm

537
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:13,299
comes much closer to the exact values

538
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:18,460
compared to the rapport estimate another

539
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:20,769
work from USENIX 2017 also develops a

540
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,720
general framework for local differential

541
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:24,940
privacy that improves the choice of

542
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,889
parameters and as a result of this

543
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,559
achieves better trade-offs between the

544
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:31,240
privacy and the utility and what you can

545
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,309
see from these graphs is that as you

546
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,129
increase the epsilon value which means

547
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:38,830
that we reduce the privacy guarantee it

548
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:42,539
achieves smaller errors and at the same

549
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:45,759
time achieves higher true positives and

550
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,580
when we are talking about this

551
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,230
comparison between the central and the

552
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,869
local models for differential privacy

553
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,999
and natural question is to ask whether

554
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:57,850
we can use secure computation techniques

555
00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:00,999
to get the best of both worlds and what

556
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:03,668
I mean here is to get the utility from

557
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:05,679
the central model while providing the

558
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:08,980
privacy guarantees from the local model

559
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,830
and their generic construction that

560
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:15,369
composed the two but often times these

561
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,289
are not the most efficient and some new

562
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:20,289
model that has been introduced this year

563
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,350
which is called the shuffle model has an

564
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,770
interesting observation

565
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:27,020
that if you take the inputs that are

566
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,120
coming from the local model or the ones

567
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,429
that have been locally randomized by

568
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,199
each of the parties and you shuffle them

569
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:35,840
randomly before sending them to this

570
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,390
untrusted aggregator you actually need

571
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,789
to add much less noise in order to

572
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,669
achieve the same level of privacy in

573
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:45,500
particular you need to add on the volga

574
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,510
rhythmic noise in this shuttle model

575
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,130
compared with the local model where you

576
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:54,770
need square root nose and this new

577
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,350
shuffle model has been used also in a

578
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:01,610
new work coming from google which is

579
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:04,070
called Wroclaw and there the shuffle

580
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,039
algorithm has been implementing using

581
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,320
edge X and they have demonstrated that

582
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,320
this performs much better than rapport

583
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,899
in terms of detecting how many unique

584
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:19,149
words for example you are coming from

585
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,440
the input of these small devices and

586
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:24,830
also when we are talking about this

587
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,039
amplification from GP and MPC I also

588
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:31,280
wanted to point out a new interesting

589
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,870
work that came from bu this year which

590
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,230
also has a very interesting title

591
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,080
turning hate into love where love stands

592
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:44,299
for a large scale one server vanishing

593
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:46,220
participants efficient MPC or more or

594
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:49,520
less the federated learning model that I

595
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,860
described and hate is a new primitive

596
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,400
homomorphic ad hoc threshold encryption

597
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,879
and then they demonstrated how you can

598
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,409
construct this federated learning

599
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,360
protocols from this new primitive and

600
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,400
give you different instantiations of

601
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,158
this primitive and also their protocols

602
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,140
meet the lower bound that they can prove

603
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:14,270
for this model in terms of how many

604
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:17,539
messages you need to exchange okay so

605
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:19,400
this also brings us to the last

606
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,379
primitive that I want to tell you about

607
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,929
in this talk which is zero knowledge

608
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,150
proof and there are knowledge proofs

609
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:30,980
help us prove that we know some secret

610
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:32,970
without revealing it and for example if

611
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,130
we have this small device and it wants

612
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,690
to send an encryption of some input but

613
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,150
at the same time we want this device to

614
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,539
be able to prove that this input is

615
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,370
within a specified range so why do we

616
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,679
want to use zero knowledge proof I

617
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:50,000
assume all of you know their application

618
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,980
in the context of work chain of proving

619
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,960
properties about encrypted data but this

620
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,140
is by far not the only interesting

621
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,730
application of zero knowledge as we saw

622
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,070
in the context of machine learning you

623
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,220
can prove properties about your inputs

624
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,260
you can also generate proofs that you

625
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,870
have correctly run the training

626
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,658
algorithm for a machine learning

627
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:15,299
algorithm or the evaluation with respect

628
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,419
to a commitment of certain uncertain

629
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,129
data and when we talk about zero

630
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,080
knowledge protocols there are several

631
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,120
efficiency properties that we should be

632
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,850
thinking about this include the prover

633
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,709
sufficiency the verifiers efficiency the

634
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,289
succinct nests which means how long are

635
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,150
the proofs whether our protocols need

636
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:36,510
interaction between the prover and the

637
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:39,510
verifier and finally whether we need

638
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:42,030
trusted setup and what does trusted

639
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,908
setup mean is that we have some phase in

640
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:47,039
which we need to embed some secret into

641
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:49,080
in what we call common reference string

642
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,379
and it is very important that this

643
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,620
secret remains hidden from every anybody

644
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,690
who'll be generating proofs because the

645
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,649
soundness of our proofs will depend on

646
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:04,049
this secret not being deep so in this

647
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,419
with respect to distrusted setup I would

648
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,490
like to distinguish snarks which means

649
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,159
succinct non interactive arguments of

650
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,400
knowledge versus other techniques for

651
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,020
zero knowledge because as far as we are

652
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,480
concerned with existing constructions

653
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:22,080
all snark constructions require trusted

654
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,240
setup and we have some new work on

655
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,668
hybrid constructions that offer you

656
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,620
dwell mode of execution that it could

657
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:34,500
behave in there either as a snarf or as

658
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:36,870
a non trusted set up system but let's

659
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,909
look at these two major types of zero

660
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:42,149
knowledge so if we want to talk about

661
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:43,470
zero knowledge snarks then most of the

662
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,969
existing constructions

663
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,919
average technique which is called

664
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,700
quadratic arithmetic programs which we

665
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:54,659
introduced a few years ago so there are

666
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,690
several systems that implement this main

667
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:00,150
technique in various different flavors

668
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,909
starting from our work Pinocchio and

669
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,900
maybe the most widely used one nowadays

670
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,990
which is lip snark

671
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,690
and in terms of what is their efficiency

672
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,789
I will give you an example from paper

673
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,240
from music this year that introduced

674
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:18,059
ways to paralyze the computation on the

675
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,549
prover note that in the case of snarks

676
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:22,639
since the proof is so short usually the

677
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:26,580
verification time is very efficient and

678
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,309
the optimization goals are on improving

679
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,010
the run time of the prover so this paper

680
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:35,280
achieves prover time that takes ten

681
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,650
microseconds per gate and the verifier

682
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,780
time is also very fast so if we want to

683
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,549
look at specific applications if you

684
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,820
want to generate the proof or the

685
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:47,760
correct training of linear regression on

686
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:52,590
20,000 points in dimension 500 this

687
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,570
takes about 95 seconds if we want to

688
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,840
look at zero knowledge without trusted

689
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:00,240
setup then we have to we have a lot of

690
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,830
trade-offs between the proof size and

691
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,440
the verifiers work that are between

692
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:09,840
logarithmic and linear there have been

693
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:12,330
many approaches to construct such such

694
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,549
protocols some of them are based on

695
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:17,100
discrete logs which include bullet

696
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,559
proofs which has been a paper with lots

697
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,740
of applications recently there are MPC

698
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,020
based approaches such as GK boo and Lee

699
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,820
hero then there are some other

700
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,789
techniques that I put in the category

701
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,658
are you yuppie based techniques such as

702
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:34,169
hyrax

703
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:36,240
GK Starks Arora so here I have some

704
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:38,490
graphs from the hyrax paper that really

705
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,230
show that there are many different

706
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,870
trade-offs when you look at these

707
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,870
systems in terms of proof size and

708
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,030
verification and prover efficiency so

709
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,649
you have to be very careful with respect

710
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,280
to your specific application what you

711
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,860
choose these numbers are for proving

712
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,960
knowledge of assignment

713
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,800
corresponding to the root of a Mirko

714
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,650
tree so you can see what's happening

715
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,430
here and since I'm running out of time

716
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:10,910
let me try to conclude I try to give you

717
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:13,580
a few examples from techniques from

718
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:16,160
advanced cryptography which all of them

719
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,679
are accompanied by implemented systems

720
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,770
so how can we use this advanced crypto

721
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,780
so a word of warning is that none of

722
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,879
this system is really out of the box use

723
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,480
system and there are good reasons for

724
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,510
that

725
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,120
because sometimes hiding complexity in

726
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:35,210
order to facilitate usability also

727
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,129
sacrifices efficiency and in many of

728
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,780
these scenarios we cannot afford to do

729
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:42,170
this we really need to squeeze every

730
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,420
last bit of efficiency so if you want to

731
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,120
use this systems you really need experts

732
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,680
even for choosing your parameters or for

733
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,739
doing comparison across different

734
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,540
frameworks the implementation code is

735
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,060
research level code so it's not

736
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,950
definitely not production level code if

737
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,950
you're interested to learn more about

738
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,270
these techniques their ongoing

739
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,310
standardization efforts in the area of

740
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,550
zero knowledge and fully homomorphic

741
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:10,220
encryption and also there are some links

742
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:13,250
that give you a starting point to learn

743
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:16,870
what's available out there for MP CDP

744
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,280
and zero knowledge and since I started

745
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,800
by saying that the inspiration for my

746
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,440
top was shakily which talk let me finish

747
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,389
also with something from his talk which

748
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,140
said that it's really time to put to use

749
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:32,510
these techniques in practice so I would

750
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,609
like to thank you and take any questions

751
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,609
[Applause]

752
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:48,879
thank you we have time for why don't we

753
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:54,799
have questions okay our last question

754
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,200
what's your favorite open questions what

755
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:04,279
would you like to solve in the next

756
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:07,340
three years five I mean it's it's

757
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,320
interesting to put together a lot of

758
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,080
this technique so if you're thinking

759
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,730
about the question of federated machine

760
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,279
learning right we we are still kind of

761
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,760
struggling to to compose in a very good

762
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,250
way differential privacy and MPC and

763
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,140
also there is the space of bringing zero

764
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,740
knowledge in terms of guaranteeing

765
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,330
correctness for the inputs so I think

766
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:32,840
combining and developing these systems

767
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:35,149
that will have very I think a huge

768
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,158
impact in practice is something that's

769
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:40,370
still an open question for me we have

770
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:44,200
some promising start thing points but

771
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,199
there is a lot of work to do in that

772
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:55,089
thank you

773
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,089
[Applause]

774
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,190
okay so the next talk will be deploying

775
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:52,570
MPC for social good and the speaker is

776
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:55,089
Lucy Cheng I'm a research software

777
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,919
engineer at Boston University and I'm

778
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,200
going to focus on one of the techniques

779
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:02,049
that Mariana just spoke to and mention

780
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,629
how we've use it in practice so I'm

781
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:10,660
speaking today on deploying MPC for

782
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:12,640
social good so I want to begin by

783
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,410
highlighting a variety of different

784
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,540
applications that we at Boston

785
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,180
University are collaborating on in the

786
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,599
space specifically of MPC for social

787
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,970
good

788
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,740
so from enabling joint medical studies

789
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,259
to allowing social scientists to share

790
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,060
research data to protecting data of

791
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,310
those recovering from opioid addiction

792
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,290
there is a wide array of societal

793
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,230
problems that can significantly benefit

794
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,390
from the use of MPC however the work

795
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,060
needed to actually go from taking an

796
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:42,009
idea to deployment involves a lot of

797
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,259
important work that happens outside the

798
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,660
scope of the cryptography itself which

799
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,730
will be the focus of my talk so today

800
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,240
I'm going to focus specifically on three

801
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:54,910
use cases and deployments and begin with

802
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,618
a study on pay equity and to make sure

803
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,589
we're on the same page of secure

804
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,599
multi-party computation or MPC is a

805
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:03,880
cryptographic technique for computing

806
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,119
some function f over private inputs

807
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,940
while yielding a public output so our

808
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,329
work and MPC began with this story here

809
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:16,089
in 2013 the mayor of Boston at the time

810
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:18,190
Mayor Menino set out to make Greater

811
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:20,170
Boston the premiere place for working

812
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,970
women in America and he wanted to do

813
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,369
this by removing the visible and

814
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,828
invisible barriers to female advancement

815
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:28,480
so this later led to the creation of

816
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:31,270
something called to the Boston Women's

817
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,030
workforce council and this council seeks

818
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:36,759
to one understand the root causes of the

819
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,369
wage gap to work towards closing that

820
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,490
gap in three evaluate the success in

821
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:44,500
doing so so currently there are over 200

822
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,930
businesses in the Boston area that have

823
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,000
signed on to a compact with the Boston

824
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,040
woman's workforce council and in this

825
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,620
compact they

826
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,450
agree to contribute their salary data

827
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,910
and also to a number of other

828
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,069
initiatives honing in on best practices

829
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,770
toward actually addressing the societal

830
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,750
issue so we at Boston University have

831
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,840
been working towards enabling this data

832
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,000
a contribution process by using MPC to

833
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,760
protect company level data while still

834
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,610
allowing aggregate data to be brought

835
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,320
forth to the public for analysis and for

836
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,590
us to really understand the wage gap

837
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,560
itself so in the originally proposed

838
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:25,800
workflow of how Boston wanted to conduct

839
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,410
a study of this level they wanted each

840
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,230
business to submit their data in the

841
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:33,839
form of spreadsheets in its raw form to

842
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,370
a trusted third party and that trusted

843
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,770
third party would take all of that data

844
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:41,040
do the proper analysis on it and

845
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:43,200
generate the results however the lawyers

846
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,170
at these companies were weary of any

847
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,299
entity receiving that raw salary data no

848
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,330
matter how trusted they actually were

849
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,640
and also the trusted third party later

850
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,310
backed out for similar reasons they were

851
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,930
also afraid of a data breach and they

852
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:02,130
didn't want to be sued potentially by

853
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:05,279
hundreds of different companies so so

854
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,950
this is where we got to MPC so our team

855
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,630
proposed an MPC based solution and as

856
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,220
shown by the challenges in the original

857
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,170
and proposed workflow there are a

858
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,850
variety of different concerns coming

859
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,530
from the perspective of different roles

860
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,650
involved in this type of study

861
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,660
so our MPC based solution has taken into

862
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,520
consideration all of these concerns in

863
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,160
order for successful deployments to

864
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,470
actually happen so first I'm going to

865
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,240
talk about the lawyers concerns as I

866
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,810
mentioned they are very concerned about

867
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,580
liability and the protocol itself thus

868
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,470
federates trust between Boston

869
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,680
University and the Boston Women's

870
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,779
workforce Council so individual level

871
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,910
data can only be revealed if the two of

872
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,160
us decide to collude and I argue that

873
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,660
neither of us are incentivized to do so

874
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,970
for the good of both of our reputations

875
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,529
and for the cause of the actual problem

876
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,470
so the Boston Women's workforce council

877
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,210
itself is concerned with participation

878
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,700
they want as many companies in the

879
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,930
Boston area to sign on and actively

880
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,270
contribute their data

881
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,399
towards us initiative so therefore the

882
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,440
solution has to be easily accessible by

883
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,170
a wide range of different companies so

884
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,960
here we have hospitals a law for firms

885
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,340
financial firms all contributing and

886
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,620
they have different types of corporate

887
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,570
environments so therefore we can't do

888
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,450
things like set up servers on specific

889
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,460
ports or run virtual machines or have to

890
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:29,220
manipulate different things involving

891
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,440
their firewalls so we chose to use a

892
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,839
browser-based solution since hopefully

893
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,500
everyone has a browser and all the code

894
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,690
here runs in the web client so the HR in

895
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,450
diversity personnel at these individual

896
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,650
companies is the person who's actually

897
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,299
contributing this data and using the

898
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,280
platform and going through this process

899
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,890
and they want to make sure that the

900
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,380
process is as easy for them to navigate

901
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,930
and that they can correctly contribute

902
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,170
their data so we have thus focused very

903
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,940
heavily on the usability and we start

904
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,980
out by first using a standardized

905
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,380
template that is familiar to them and

906
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,050
they are ready to use versions of this

907
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,090
for regulatory purposes and we're also

908
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,650
continually working on a number of

909
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,630
different things to improve the

910
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,720
usability of the platform which I will

911
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,580
speak to you later so lastly we have the

912
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,589
IT personnel at the companies who is

913
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,660
interested in verifying the code itself

914
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,370
and making sure that it provides the

915
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,250
security guarantees that we claim that

916
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,230
it does so therefore our code is open

917
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,330
source and available on github for

918
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,490
anyone to audit and we have purposely

919
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,830
written it so that it is as clear and

920
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,379
concise as possible so that it is easy

921
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,660
to verify and in managing all of these

922
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,580
concerns of the roles there is another

923
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,670
element of simplicity that I want to

924
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,620
emphasize so we use an additive seeker

925
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,990
sharing scheme under a semi honest

926
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,359
threat model so protocol here itself has

927
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,390
existed for some time now and there is

928
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,950
nothing really new in it it's in itself

929
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,960
and there are definitely more

930
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,520
technically sophisticated platforms out

931
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,260
there that deal with these complex

932
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,440
issues of scalability and performance

933
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,510
that come along with MPC but as I

934
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,550
mentioned the simplicity here is really

935
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,610
intentional we need to be able to

936
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,140
explain the solution to CEOs lawyers to

937
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,330
all the different roles that I just

938
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,890
mentioned and they have to be

939
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,810
successfully convinced enough to want

940
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,540
give over their data to us and believe

941
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,730
that it really will be protected and as

942
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,650
you see here we add a random mask to the

943
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,930
data which is passed along to Boston

944
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,220
University while the masks themselves

945
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,319
are given to the Boston Women's

946
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,839
workforce council there for segmenting

947
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,180
trust and the image here is the actual

948
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,590
explanation that we use to the various

949
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,270
different types of people that we need

950
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,580
buy-in from and we have been

951
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,200
successfully able to do this to actually

952
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:47,049
get them to agree to this contribution

953
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,819
process and we also hold training

954
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:51,160
sessions where HR and diversity

955
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,720
personnel can attend ask questions and

956
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,990
be walked through the submission process

957
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,879
itself and here is a stripped-down

958
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,859
version of what the platform actually

959
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,100
looks like you can see the full thing at

960
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,380
a hundred talent org so each user is

961
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,509
given a session key and participation

962
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,760
code as I mentioned before there is a

963
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,760
standardized template that they receive

964
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,710
in Excel form and they can pre-fill it

965
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,810
and then drag and drop it here and it

966
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,180
will autofill all the fields necessary

967
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:21,160
or they can go through and fill out each

968
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,490
cell in the spreadsheet manually on the

969
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,710
platform itself so this screenshot only

970
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,839
depicts total annual compensation but we

971
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,780
have also gathered aggregate data on

972
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,330
performance pay which measures bonuses

973
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,460
and also the length of service to get a

974
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:39,279
more granular look at this problem

975
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,740
itself and we also gather data based on

976
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,570
race and job category so we can look

977
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,669
across the different levels from

978
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,060
executive down to more entry level

979
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,680
positions so an interesting lesson we've

980
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,990
learned here is that we've had to be

981
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,000
very specific about the language we're

982
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,399
using when we actually explain what's

983
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,620
going on on the platform so words like

984
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,960
upload or submit have a general

985
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,120
connotation of giving over data in its

986
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,820
plain text form but here that doesn't

987
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,180
happen it never leaves the actual

988
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:12,310
browser in that form so we do not use

989
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,009
the word upload in the drag and drop box

990
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:17,680
here we also had to very explicitly

991
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,490
state what submit means in this specific

992
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,089
context

993
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:24,339
so since recovering mistakes under MPC

994
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,230
can be expensive we have added error

995
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,960
checks to help make sure the process is

996
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,710
as error-prone as possible we have

997
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,080
information about what the upper

998
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,730
bound uncertain metrics might be given

999
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,549
the cohort of different companies that

1000
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,500
do participate in the study so therefore

1001
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,930
we can provide warnings when numbers

1002
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,580
exceed that upper bound and we also

1003
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,919
provide checks to make sure that the

1004
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:49,069
format itself is correct before we allow

1005
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,349
users to submit so as you can see here

1006
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,000
there are a number of errors that can be

1007
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:55,040
triggered and they all have to be

1008
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,190
cleared before the user can actually

1009
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,070
submit their data and we also provide

1010
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,480
something we call a totals check

1011
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,550
throughout the process we just count up

1012
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,230
all the different personnel that were

1013
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:10,700
included in the data and therefore

1014
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,680
employees can look at that and have a

1015
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,060
sanity check of whether the total

1016
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,660
actually matches up with their

1017
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,910
organization so we do also allow users

1018
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,589
to resubmit their data and overwrite

1019
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,410
whatever has been previously submitted

1020
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:27,320
in case there is an error and we

1021
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,839
conducted this MPC submission process

1022
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,300
over a period of a week so if they

1023
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,609
discover something on day two they can

1024
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:38,210
still go fix those problems and then

1025
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:40,310
submit later on so as I mentioned we

1026
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,660
want to emphasize usability for the

1027
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,150
employees actually submitting the data

1028
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,549
as part of this process we asked a

1029
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,320
number of high-level questions such as

1030
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,570
the relative ease of preparing the data

1031
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,190
for submission and the type of training

1032
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,680
that they've had in doing so and the

1033
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,589
answers to the survey responses here are

1034
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,089
also seeker shared we have also been

1035
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,430
interested in getting more granular

1036
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:03,980
level data on the user experience itself

1037
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,190
but we can't use a third party web

1038
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,320
analytics engine like Google Analytics

1039
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,000
without potentially revealing data so

1040
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,490
therefore we've added some basic web

1041
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,500
analytics such as errors users encounter

1042
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:18,140
the average time spent and mouse

1043
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,480
movement into the MPC protocol this data

1044
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,029
is secret shared along with the actual

1045
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,920
data about the salaries and the survey

1046
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:27,800
questions that I just mentioned and this

1047
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,930
is only seen in aggregate form so the

1048
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,940
picture on the right here shows the

1049
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,129
mouse movements from a Mechanical Turk

1050
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,560
study we conducted using this method

1051
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,320
moving forward we want to a be test our

1052
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,320
platform to have a better understanding

1053
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,970
quantitatively of the user experience so

1054
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,510
because of the security guarantees at

1055
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,459
MPC

1056
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,350
provides the work done in addressing the

1057
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,360
wide spectrum of concerns from different

1058
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,310
roles involved in the study we have been

1059
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,940
able to successfully deploy this twice

1060
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:58,820
now first in 2016 and again in 2017 and

1061
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,920
in 2017 a hundred and fourteen employers

1062
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,860
participated in this and that accounted

1063
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,470
for sixteen percent of the workforce in

1064
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:09,740
the Greater Boston area and we are once

1065
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:13,310
again deploying this in fall of 2019 so

1066
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,959
the results here are unsurprising and if

1067
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,940
you're interested in learning more about

1068
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,750
what the wage gap problem looks like in

1069
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,240
the Boston area

1070
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,470
you can feel free to read the reports

1071
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,870
that the Boston Women's workforce

1072
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,720
Council puts out based on the results of

1073
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,520
this data itself so and although studies

1074
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,430
have been done in the past on wage

1075
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,570
equity we are able to gather data

1076
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,149
longitudinally with more participants

1077
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:38,180
added each year as our mayor Marty Walsh

1078
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,580
notes in 2014 there were only 38

1079
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:43,790
companies committed to this study and

1080
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,799
now there are over 250 and since the

1081
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,080
study occurs periodically we are hoping

1082
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,540
to gather data on specific cohorts over

1083
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,120
time to be able to assess of the wage

1084
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,220
gap is widening or closing as different

1085
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,020
practices are implemented this also

1086
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,180
helps us actually drive accountability

1087
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,190
towards addressing the problem since

1088
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,190
we're seeing the different effects over

1089
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:06,410
time in the data itself because of its

1090
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,420
granular nature can help drive a more

1091
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,759
nuanced discussion of the wage gap in

1092
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,090
Boston we are able to see where the gap

1093
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,740
is wider and how that varies by job and

1094
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,870
race and in the next employment we're

1095
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,819
also working towards industry specific

1096
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:22,370
breakdowns as well so we can compare

1097
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,800
different industries and how they match

1098
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,569
up with the average and the granularity

1099
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,850
of the data also allows us to get more

1100
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:31,190
specific about the solutions and allows

1101
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:34,220
us to address the places of the grossest

1102
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:36,560
inequalities and of course although the

1103
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,390
MPC is an important piece in gathering

1104
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,570
this data it is only part of the broader

1105
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:43,190
solution towards this societal issue the

1106
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,170
Boston Women's workforce Council is

1107
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,300
involved in making connections with all

1108
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,890
of these companies hosting workshops and

1109
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,630
hearing from the businesses themselves

1110
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,640
on the roadblocks that contribute to pay

1111
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,650
equity they also talk about best

1112
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,080
practices toward advancing women in the

1113
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,060
workforce as a whole so this data can

1114
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,160
help drive the

1115
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,740
conversation but that conversation still

1116
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,750
needs to happen between actual people

1117
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,500
coming together to discuss the changes

1118
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:10,240
that need to happen in the workplace and

1119
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,460
with that I want to discuss another use

1120
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,830
case of MPC in the city of Boston that

1121
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,750
we have been involved in so we're

1122
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,310
working with the Greater Boston Chamber

1123
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,620
of Commerce on an initiative to promote

1124
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,570
economic inclusion companies are

1125
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,390
expected to increase their supplier

1126
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,610
diversity here by supporting local women

1127
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:29,980
and minority-owned businesses and we

1128
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:32,410
collect metrics similar to the other

1129
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,300
study in aggregate form on spending

1130
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,069
toward these types of businesses versus

1131
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,130
total spending by these companies as a

1132
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:41,440
whole and right now there are currently

1133
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,880
around or they're more than ten

1134
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,770
companies participating in these

1135
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,200
deployments so it's happening at a much

1136
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,900
larger smaller scale than the pay equity

1137
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,509
study but we've been able to repurpose

1138
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,750
the same platform for that study here

1139
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,460
with a simple configuration file and

1140
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,140
we've also applied the same lessons

1141
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,900
we've learned in usability and

1142
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,089
accessibility and auditability and in

1143
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,040
how we've been communicating MPC to

1144
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:08,230
allow for successful deployment to

1145
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,150
happen and this was first employed last

1146
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:14,590
spring and we're looking at an upcoming

1147
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:16,150
deployment in March and so now I'm going

1148
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,280
to switch gears and talk briefly about a

1149
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,800
different use case in detecting serial

1150
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,360
perpetrators of sexual misconduct so

1151
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,260
close there was a non-profit that

1152
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,030
creates technology to combat sexual

1153
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,040
misconduct and they first created a

1154
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:33,040
sexual assault reporting tool on college

1155
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,020
campuses so with that platform they were

1156
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,580
able to see some really great impact

1157
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,830
where students were six times more

1158
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,090
likely to report through Callisto and

1159
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,250
there were three times were more likely

1160
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,800
to seek out medical and emotional

1161
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,510
support and they also found that 15% of

1162
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,980
the survivors using the tool were

1163
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,370
actually able to be matched with another

1164
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:53,260
survivor that named the same perpetrator

1165
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:55,210
going off of the me2 movement last year

1166
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,220
Callisto wanted to expand this work into

1167
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,140
tech serial perpetrators in industry

1168
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,330
settings in a way that was empowering

1169
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,520
for survivors so they were interested in

1170
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,140
a cryptographic approach that could stop

1171
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,790
the spread of sexual violence while

1172
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,220
protecting the privacy and civil

1173
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:12,080
liberties of both the survivor and the

1174
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,750
accused so this is where my

1175
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,090
and some others come in on the crypto

1176
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,920
side of things so we work together with

1177
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:21,200
kalisto on a design and implementation

1178
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,990
that guarantees that identifying

1179
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,180
information about a survivor and accused

1180
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:28,040
can only be decrypted by a lawyer when

1181
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,560
at least two users name the same

1182
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,860
perpetrator so I'm going to describe a

1183
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,140
very watered down version of the design

1184
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,610
omitting a lot of the details here in

1185
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,009
order to just highlight a few key

1186
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,820
takeaways but for more information you

1187
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,440
can refer to the white paper shown here

1188
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,990
so let's say Alice and Bob named the

1189
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,210
same perpetrator the same key is then

1190
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:53,000
determine distally deterministically

1191
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:54,560
generated this key is then used to help

1192
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,100
encrypt any identifying information

1193
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,720
about either of them and Mallory so

1194
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,819
let's say we have another user here

1195
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,370
Carlos who names a different perpetrator

1196
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,620
Eve an entirely different key is then

1197
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,390
generated and through the use of an

1198
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,790
oblivious pseudo-random function with

1199
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:13,069
two different servers involved the slope

1200
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,380
and intercept values here for Shamir

1201
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,230
seekers sharing are generated based on

1202
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,670
the perpetrator identity so as I

1203
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,620
mentioned this uses from your secret

1204
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,720
sharing with a threshold of two and the

1205
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,060
secret of the perpetrator identity is

1206
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,270
embedded in the slope and the key which

1207
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:31,790
serves at the y-intercept so Alice and

1208
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,670
Bob then have the exact same slope and

1209
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:37,250
key values but differing hashed user IDs

1210
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:39,860
which ultimately generate different Y

1211
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:42,260
values and these x and y values then

1212
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,600
represent Alice and Bob as shares that

1213
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:48,020
can be used to reconstruct that original

1214
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:51,860
key this then reveals that key which we

1215
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:55,280
can use to decrypt information about the

1216
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,930
users and the perpetrator and as you see

1217
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,790
here Carlos who named a different

1218
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:02,299
perpetrator Eve cannot be used to

1219
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,740
construct the key in the same manner oh

1220
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,210
and I wanted to point out there are

1221
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,790
other techniques involved that I have

1222
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:10,220
not mentioned so once again refer to the

1223
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:12,080
white paper so I wanted to bring up this

1224
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,149
example specifically because it is

1225
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,840
another deployment where the crypto has

1226
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:20,000
been successful in tandem with advocacy

1227
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,860
and that advocacy work is rooted deeply

1228
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,480
and understanding the population that

1229
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,520
the technology itself serves

1230
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,650
there is important work happening

1231
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,590
Callisto on trauma informed design and

1232
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,390
making sure that the process itself does

1233
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,970
not reach Ramat eyes the user who's

1234
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:37,520
using it and they also put out a

1235
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:39,859
survivor guide that a numerous different

1236
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,180
resources outside of the technology that

1237
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:46,130
users can benefit from yeah and there's

1238
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,750
also real empathy because of the word

1239
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,430
Callisto has already done on college

1240
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,410
campuses they're building off of

1241
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,480
information and lessons learned from

1242
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:56,270
that process so there is a credibility

1243
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,400
and human sense of trust so the crypto

1244
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,590
code here is also open source and

1245
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,200
auditable by anyone who would like to

1246
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:05,240
view it and of course the crypto on its

1247
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,220
own would fail to take on a life without

1248
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,740
all of this work that has come before it

1249
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,720
and also along with it and this touches

1250
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,220
back on the same critical pieces of work

1251
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,250
that needs to be done on the usability

1252
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,290
and accessibility side and in making

1253
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:21,830
sure you are fully communicating the

1254
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,930
guarantees to your users so hopefully I

1255
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,360
have demonstrated that MPC has broad

1256
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:29,000
appeal in applicability to a variety of

1257
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,680
causes and feels the techniques I've

1258
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,810
mentioned have like additive seeker

1259
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,819
sharing or Shamir secret sharing have

1260
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:37,640
existed for decades and are not

1261
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:39,590
necessarily novel but they do show how

1262
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,170
even very simple protocols can have a

1263
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,480
huge impact when joined together with

1264
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,310
strong partnerships and vital work in

1265
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,290
addressing all of this stuff outside of

1266
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,960
crypto such as the usability

1267
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:52,970
accessibility and auditability so I'm

1268
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,370
really excited about the play that MPC

1269
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,319
can be applied to to help tackle

1270
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:01,480
different social problems and I hope you

1271
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,480
are as well so thank you

1272
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:14,970
thank you questions I first I just

1273
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:17,369
wanted to say thank you this sounds like

1274
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:20,160
fantastic work and like I'm really glad

1275
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:22,770
that people are working on it across

1276
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,740
both the advocacy and the technical side

1277
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,270
and that's part of my question is from

1278
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,569
the first case study where you talked

1279
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:33,810
about with the sharing of the salary

1280
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:35,220
data you can very easily imagine that

1281
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:36,690
the lawyers get together in to say no

1282
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,919
this isn't gonna happen

1283
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,390
we're not gonna give it to any third

1284
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,220
party and obviously you need some

1285
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,618
trusted third party in order to do this

1286
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:47,430
so the whole project to shut down how

1287
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:49,410
did that gap from that business side of

1288
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,819
it - like how did anybody think like

1289
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,160
maybe somebody at Boston University

1290
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:54,810
knows a way that we can do this without

1291
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:00,029
sharing the data like how did that

1292
00:54:54,810 --> 00:55:04,140
happen yeah yeah so I think it took a

1293
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:06,450
lot of work on our team - like I said to

1294
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:09,210
make sure we're communicating those

1295
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:11,520
guarantees very properly so I think it

1296
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,650
is we've done a lot of iterations of how

1297
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,329
we explain MPC and additive secret

1298
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:19,339
sharing itself so we've tried out

1299
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:21,690
different graphics different visuals and

1300
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:23,940
throughout time have refined those more

1301
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:26,069
and more but yeah it's just a lot of

1302
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,599
making sure that you're testing out

1303
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:30,869
different ideas and seeing how they

1304
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,069
click with the exact users your I guess

1305
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,589
in this case the lawyers that you're

1306
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:35,670
speaking to and really honing in on what

1307
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:38,970
their concerns are

1308
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:43,640
I really cool work on the Calista's

1309
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:46,348
system I had a question who who enters

1310
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,078
information into the system and what

1311
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:51,329
prevents like a party just like trying

1312
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:53,490
to probe and in exfiltrated information

1313
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,839
out that is it is it access control in

1314
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:58,259
that you have to be a lawyer to enter

1315
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:00,960
information into it or no so the

1316
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,609
individual users are the ones entering

1317
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,200
their own information but the lawyers

1318
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,690
are the only ones who can actually

1319
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,149
decrypt that information and they each

1320
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,430
have their own private keys that are

1321
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:15,440
necessary before they can even access

1322
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,440
the platform itself okay Thanks so

1323
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:20,160
multi-party computation requires a bit

1324
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,869
more math than

1325
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,020
typical stakeholder would be familiar

1326
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:26,160
with did you have any difficulty

1327
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:29,420
explaining to them what you were doing

1328
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:35,250
it and and getting them to trust you

1329
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:37,770
yeah yeah so so that's all we really

1330
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,270
have to go back and focus on these types

1331
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,819
of visuals so we've used things in the

1332
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,288
past like perhaps like cakes so

1333
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:45,750
demonstrating it in something that's

1334
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:47,760
let's focus on math and more something

1335
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,829
that's a bit more tangible we've also

1336
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,530
used different levels of bar graphs and

1337
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:54,180
showing how if you take one bar graph

1338
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,789
and then you subtract out some other

1339
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:59,009
bars from it and something of that sort

1340
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:02,190
showing the end results we also have

1341
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,020
some paper demos that we've run through

1342
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,420
with people where we have them write

1343
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,680
down their own secret number have them

1344
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,809
pass that sheet of paper along to

1345
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,868
someone else have them add a mask and

1346
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:14,730
repeat this process and allow people to

1347
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:16,920
ask open-ended questions about it and

1348
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,750
follow up on that did you did you have

1349
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,940
very many people you met with very many

1350
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:24,510
decision-makers who just never came

1351
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,970
around who remained resistant so there

1352
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,950
are some people who on the opposite side

1353
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,490
of things have agreed to participate in

1354
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,980
the process

1355
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:34,890
but then done things like give us an NDA

1356
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,930
for the data when we've gone back and

1357
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:38,788
said hey we don't have the data that is

1358
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:41,009
actually the core guarantee here that

1359
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:46,859
we're making so we've definitely seen

1360
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:56,029
stuff like that thank you any other

1361
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:56,029
questions so hi this one

1362
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,210
is it better yeah thank you for the talk

1363
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,000
it's very interesting so I was wondering

1364
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:12,060
is there a chance that an employee or

1365
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,180
the HR personnel could submit the salary

1366
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,890
information which is not exactly the

1367
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,960
information that goes to the pay slips

1368
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:21,890
of the employees like can they submit

1369
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:29,130
wrong information just to show that they

1370
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:30,330
like in in terms of wages hey sorry I

1371
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,980
couldn't write the entire question would

1372
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:35,180
you mind repeating it slightly louder oh

1373
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,950
yeah sure so is there a chance that an

1374
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:40,980
HR personnel submits salary information

1375
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:43,618
which is not the actual information that

1376
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,780
goes into the pay slips that are in the

1377
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,000
passage just to show that they are

1378
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:50,150
providing equal wages but they're not

1379
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,980
actually so is there a need for

1380
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:55,290
verifying the salary information yeah I

1381
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:59,190
think that is something that would be

1382
00:58:55,290 --> 00:59:00,990
ideal so actually because of the way

1383
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:03,840
that the Boston Women's workforce

1384
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:05,279
council communicates with these

1385
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,410
companies that's not something we're

1386
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,600
able to provide so the companies that

1387
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:12,450
can choose to contribute their data or

1388
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,190
not as you saw there were over 250

1389
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,839
companies actually in the compact but

1390
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:18,420
around half of them actually contribute

1391
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,850
data so some of these companies want an

1392
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,320
element of being able to say like hey we

1393
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,540
care about this issue so we're going to

1394
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,040
be in this compact but we're not part of

1395
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,930
this data that was actually in there

1396
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,910
because we're doing well so they want

1397
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,368
that ability to have an out in that

1398
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:35,879
manner so therefore we can't actually

1399
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:37,950
verify who is in the data set and who

1400
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,400
has contributed data and because that we

1401
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:44,129
also can't verify any notion of

1402
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,869
correctness so for things to move

1403
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:48,359
forward in that fashion there would have

1404
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:50,790
to be some changes in the communication

1405
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:52,500
with these companies and changes

1406
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:58,200
fundamentally and how the compact is

1407
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:59,800
structured thank you thank you Lisa the

1408
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:07,919
next stock

1409
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:11,770
[Applause]

1410
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,800
so the next talk is towards transparent

1411
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:25,559
zero knowledge computation and Kurt

1412
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:25,559
Nilsen will will give the talk yes yes

1413
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:51,779
okay thank you I will continue the the

1414
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:54,270
disc to talk about how to convince

1415
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:56,910
people about using this fantastic

1416
01:00:54,270 --> 01:01:01,800
technology serum cylinders computation

1417
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:04,770
or multi-party computation so I've been

1418
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,750
I'm not a disclaimer I'm not a computer

1419
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,910
scientist I'm an economist but I heard

1420
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,589
about this technology for 15 years ago I

1421
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,410
was convinced about this and as a

1422
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:16,109
researcher we made up we raised money

1423
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:18,598
and we farm years after we created the

1424
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:22,078
first use of this technology which was

1425
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:24,210
commercial use and the company that used

1426
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,220
this I wanted to buy the solution

1427
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:29,339
afterwards so we did a university

1428
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,558
spin-out which is Patricia and what I'm

1429
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:33,328
talking about is what we have been doing

1430
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:35,760
and trying to convince people about

1431
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:41,670
buying into this technology and use that

1432
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:45,540
for a number of applications yeah that's

1433
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:48,930
that's basically the the talk and it has

1434
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:55,650
been used commercially for 10 years by

1435
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:57,690
now so it's it's not the new - G - yeah

1436
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,960
it has been used basically so let me

1437
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:03,869
just talk to you talk to some of the

1438
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,470
challenges that we have been facing so

1439
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:09,990
clearly doing computation it's just in a

1440
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:11,848
black box like MPC requires that

1441
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:14,009
convince people about what what do we

1442
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:15,869
actually doing so transparency and and

1443
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:18,180
the platform that we're using is super

1444
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:21,510
important so the first case that we we

1445
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:24,270
had was a was very tangible in terms of

1446
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:26,700
running a multi-party computation it was

1447
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:28,680
an industry set up some contracts needed

1448
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,680
to be exchanged among buyers and sellers

1449
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,230
and each of the parties you can see the

1450
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,799
pictures there they came with their own

1451
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:39,869
laptop and the USB stick with the

1452
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,940
cryptographic materials so it was very

1453
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:43,799
tangible that they were they were

1454
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:47,640
connected least three computers and he

1455
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:49,410
computed the clearing price so this

1456
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,509
applications actually distributed the

1457
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:53,819
exchange it was a standard exchange

1458
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:56,880
mechanism that was implemented using

1459
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:57,740
this technology so that was the starting

1460
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,030
point

1461
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:05,339
sorry that was pretty slow but the

1462
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,630
running an auction like this was not

1463
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,580
really an issue because there was a

1464
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,650
plenty of time she to wait for the

1465
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,299
result even though I think it took

1466
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:17,490
fifteen minutes or so with everything

1467
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:21,360
since then the the protocols has

1468
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:25,140
improved tremendously buying by by the

1469
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:29,430
contribution from a lot of you so and

1470
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:32,779
that sort of leads mg makes it possible

1471
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:35,160
to apply the technology to two other

1472
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:38,430
applications and that's what we have

1473
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,620
been trying to do so definitely doing

1474
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:43,049
more auctions in the beginning moving

1475
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:47,700
into key management doing more

1476
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:50,040
statistics and and so on so that's one

1477
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,350
side of it the other side is to move

1478
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,060
into platforms that are more scalable

1479
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:59,490
but maybe also a little less transparent

1480
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:01,620
using cloud computing but you could run

1481
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:04,350
it on on separate cloud service

1482
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:09,270
providers at least it's just to signal

1483
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:11,509
that it's truly just distributed or what

1484
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:15,240
we are doing recently is to use

1485
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:16,800
blockchain technology to have maybe

1486
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,250
create some more transparencies that's

1487
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:22,470
at least what we will claim and done

1488
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:25,100
right I guess we could also get this to

1489
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:28,500
to scale I'll be talking more about this

1490
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:31,049
but basically one of the challenges is

1491
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,430
that we are selling trust so it's we

1492
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,560
have to convince people that it's more

1493
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:37,910
trustworthy teach you just to be you the

1494
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:41,310
system instead of just pointing or

1495
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:45,990
basically a counter bribe a consultancy

1496
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:49,110
to do a trust trust to solve the the job

1497
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:54,959
as a trustee and that is the challenge

1498
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:56,550
it clearly is and when you convince them

1499
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,970
about that then the next question is who

1500
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:02,610
should actually run the notes so the

1501
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:05,549
initial case where we had the some

1502
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:08,700
natural groups of persons buyers and

1503
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:10,200
sellers you could basically hand and

1504
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:14,399
note to each of these

1505
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:17,578
groups other cases you might not know a

1506
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,220
priori who's who should actually who

1507
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:24,560
would be the posting interest in this

1508
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:28,770
this setting so you need some notes and

1509
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:30,299
that just continues to be a chance but

1510
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:37,710
that's also some of the things that we

1511
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:39,450
had shrugging in within solving so let

1512
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,190
me introduce so what we have been doing

1513
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:44,160
is that we started the petition ten

1514
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:47,280
years ago and then we tried to sort of

1515
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,649
sell the the big vision and which was

1516
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,650
difficult at that time but that was

1517
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:55,500
people who who who saw the the use of

1518
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:57,960
having a tissue field option and we

1519
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:02,550
found the first industrial investors did

1520
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:04,890
a cloud solution option systems and then

1521
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:08,760
we moved into two key management got the

1522
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:10,680
first institutional investors and along

1523
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,410
the way we've been looking a lot at

1524
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:16,649
statistical solutions and that has been

1525
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:18,690
but that's something that we have spin

1526
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:21,480
out spin doubt in in in a separate

1527
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:27,510
country oh sorry a separate company

1528
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:29,460
recently and and and what we're doing

1529
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:31,230
now is actually to combine some of these

1530
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,630
resources that we have been working on

1531
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:36,119
and into something they called privacy

1532
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:39,859
blockchain and I would talk a little

1533
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,859
more about that in in a minute

1534
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,230
so basically I want to sort of walk

1535
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,440
through some of the applications that we

1536
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:52,200
have been doing and then go back to this

1537
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:54,900
idea of privacy blockchain and maybe try

1538
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:58,078
to convince you why we need an

1539
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:01,339
infrastructure like this so the

1540
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:06,119
beginning was auctions so you basically

1541
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:10,140
remove that weak third party institution

1542
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,910
distribute the option is to make the

1543
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,879
institution more trustworthy and maybe

1544
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:17,490
also more cost efficient and that's what

1545
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:22,200
we have been doing selling various

1546
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:24,089
commodities like spectrum rights used

1547
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,459
for telecommunication

1548
01:07:24,089 --> 01:07:28,229
rough diamonds working on that on

1549
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:31,198
high-stake option for rough diamonds

1550
01:07:28,229 --> 01:07:35,509
working on electricity options so it's

1551
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:38,539
solve a problem in that in that space a

1552
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:42,329
similar type of mechanism is matching

1553
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:44,809
and a case that we are building as which

1554
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:47,699
week is off exchange matching or

1555
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:50,099
basically what is known as the dark pool

1556
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:53,309
so we take the dark pool operators and

1557
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:55,019
distribute that one of the challenges

1558
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:57,539
with these dark pool is that if they get

1559
01:07:55,019 --> 01:08:01,618
hacks you get a lot of valuable

1560
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:06,089
information and so they're so they are

1561
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:08,160
an example of a wonderful third party in

1562
01:08:06,089 --> 01:08:13,949
the financial system that could be

1563
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:17,399
improved by a distributed set up that's

1564
01:08:13,949 --> 01:08:19,828
also gave to us a lot of chances so the

1565
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:22,439
Year requirement was high this should be

1566
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:26,639
run really fast this should be for

1567
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:29,189
tolerance they wanted as many notes as

1568
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:31,949
they could get so I think we ended up

1569
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:35,969
passing the requirements with seven

1570
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:38,578
notes and this technology is now been

1571
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:40,710
moved in she brought change so this is a

1572
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:44,939
also becoming a blockchain application

1573
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:48,118
because the the design is really it's

1574
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:51,888
this institution has been designed to

1575
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:55,799
have institutional investors trade on on

1576
01:08:51,889 --> 01:09:00,059
on financial markets but smaller smaller

1577
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:03,778
smaller buyers and sellers meeting the

1578
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:06,569
same chances on selling crypto assets in

1579
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:08,880
in the blockchain space so that's what

1580
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:12,650
we are trying to choose solve with this

1581
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:15,389
solution that would be a separate entity

1582
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:20,658
well that would be announced relatively

1583
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:23,659
soon so that's the market design

1584
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:23,658
solutions

1585
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:31,490
in terms of statistics we have been

1586
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:34,250
focusing on privacy-preserving statistic

1587
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:38,740
in different settings the the first one

1588
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:42,109
the one to the left is a is a very

1589
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:44,300
interesting case so this is about the

1590
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:46,880
Danish statistics and it's about the

1591
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:50,090
Dainius health care data that is to

1592
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,740
public registers that has never been

1593
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:55,070
combined they're not allowed to combine

1594
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:57,800
this but now they see the opportunity to

1595
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:59,960
use a two party system so they can claim

1596
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,630
okay they don't really combine the data

1597
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:07,160
but it's still making them available to

1598
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:09,470
run analysis on these combined data and

1599
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:12,080
healthcare and socio-economic data which

1600
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:15,470
is clearly highly valuable especially

1601
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:17,510
because in Denmark where this is

1602
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:20,030
happening they have registered all the

1603
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:23,180
citizens from their birth for the past

1604
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:26,389
250 years so that's a really long track

1605
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:30,740
record on on URIs on a full on and on on

1606
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:35,590
an unbiased sample of the population so

1607
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:38,809
you can match in a number of scenarios

1608
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:43,700
in pharmaceutical companies coming in

1609
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:47,870
and simulating a phase two trial which

1610
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:51,110
is super valuable if you can if you can

1611
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:54,410
detect some challenges with a new drug

1612
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:57,530
at an early stage and things like that

1613
01:10:54,410 --> 01:11:00,800
so but this is this will be some very

1614
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:03,259
controlled type of computations were

1615
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,330
these two public registers they would

1616
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,220
say they would look at the computation

1617
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,710
that you would like to run and they will

1618
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:11,890
say go and no go and then you can run

1619
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:16,280
the D computation and get your

1620
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:18,440
aggregated statistics at the end so

1621
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,320
that's one case the other case is

1622
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:24,860
another blockchain application which is

1623
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,320
remove or basically disrupting the data

1624
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:31,370
broker so it's a decentralized system

1625
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:33,980
that give control to the data subjects

1626
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:37,820
so you as a data subject you can sell

1627
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:38,409
your data to a Data regressor so the the

1628
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,259
youth

1629
01:11:38,409 --> 01:11:44,159
NPC in this is that that's running a

1630
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:48,070
number of two-party matching of the

1631
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:50,530
requesters needs and you you a personal

1632
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:53,139
data and if you match the criteria then

1633
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:57,370
you get to trade your data in a token

1634
01:11:53,139 --> 01:12:01,780
economy so so yeah so that's basically

1635
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:05,139
what it what it does distributed system

1636
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:07,449
that removes the the central the

1637
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:11,340
middleman as a data broker and

1638
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:17,860
distributed to you the individual data

1639
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:21,639
subjects and that's the thing that this

1640
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:26,559
technology can do so the last this one

1641
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:31,870
is is basically a treasure cryptography

1642
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:35,489
it's solving things like more secure

1643
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:38,920
solution for crypto wallets more

1644
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:42,428
cloud-based key management systems and

1645
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,750
we actually have the full the number of

1646
01:12:42,429 --> 01:12:46,300
people from the from zip you're here

1647
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:52,000
today so just let me know if you want to

1648
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:54,699
an introduction so with that's sort of

1649
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,920
the the the some of the basic things

1650
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:59,710
that we've been going on and as I

1651
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:03,040
mentioned there's actually a crypt took

1652
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:05,860
a blockchain application in each of

1653
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,620
these fields market design statistics

1654
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,179
key management and what we have been

1655
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:15,190
felt and that we have been going on for

1656
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:17,409
the past year or two and that we want to

1657
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:19,900
combine and the insight that we have we

1658
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:22,719
have achieved by this work we combine

1659
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:24,719
that into this new project so we have

1660
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,760
that the key management is actually a

1661
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,380
component in this solutions and the

1662
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,530
first tier application which is in

1663
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:35,800
matching and the dative brogan the

1664
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:37,840
distributed data Roga is two nice

1665
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,120
examples of what you could do with an

1666
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,580
application with an infrastructure like

1667
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:46,360
the one we want you to construct or is

1668
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:47,769
basically constructing as we speak we

1669
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,500
just want to make it easier for people

1670
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:52,830
to to create applications like this in

1671
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,830
the future

1672
01:13:53,130 --> 01:14:02,800
yes so blockchain and privacy might be

1673
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:06,539
sort of an evolution and and what we're

1674
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:09,250
focusing on is basically step three so

1675
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:11,110
where you have a lot of information that

1676
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:15,059
involved from many uses

1677
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:18,219
so using zero knowledge proof is not

1678
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:20,619
feasible you need something that is that

1679
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:23,289
can that are more flexible that can do

1680
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:26,320
to narrow your computations and that's

1681
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:29,289
basically what this project is focusing

1682
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,599
on whether you believe in this vision or

1683
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:34,929
not it's at least something that is been

1684
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:37,030
articulated the web tree data where you

1685
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:41,800
get some sort of a blockchain computer

1686
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:44,469
and you and to have this to solve real

1687
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,449
property definitely needs as serious

1688
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:51,460
privacy meshes and that's what we are

1689
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:55,480
trying to g22 add in a distributed

1690
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:58,090
fashion so going back to that

1691
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,980
infrastructure from our perspective is

1692
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:02,699
basically three things so you have the

1693
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:05,949
the lecture you have the smart contracts

1694
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:07,989
you have the privacy meshes which is

1695
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:13,449
basically what you would need to to

1696
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:16,480
solve a number of problems and I will

1697
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:18,730
come back to that try to ask you what is

1698
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,030
the class of problems that we we are

1699
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:24,968
focusing on so just two more words about

1700
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:28,030
this infrastructure so one thing is the

1701
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:31,179
notes so you have the blockchain which

1702
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:33,159
we are we're just not really changing

1703
01:15:31,179 --> 01:15:35,619
anything just taking the best practice

1704
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:38,888
blockchain but that's sort of a separate

1705
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:41,980
job to solve as a node then you have the

1706
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:47,940
this what we call seek a computation

1707
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:51,638
which is MPC which is a it's a separate

1708
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:54,509
task for these nodes and typically you

1709
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:57,340
have large networks for the blockchain

1710
01:15:54,510 --> 01:16:00,730
infrastructure for the MPC you'll have

1711
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:03,550
smaller ad hoc networks so if you need

1712
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,769
and you need to separate these two and

1713
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:06,800
they

1714
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:08,960
need to collaborate to get these get the

1715
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,490
synergies out of these two different and

1716
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,160
networks and that's what we are

1717
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:15,980
struggling with getting that in place we

1718
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:20,690
it's it's really all about orchestration

1719
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:25,179
it make it simple to come with your

1720
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:28,639
problem get a provable secure protocol

1721
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:33,230
delegate trust in the in the system and

1722
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,080
then then get a efficient simple and

1723
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:38,750
robust execution which is what we've

1724
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:43,130
been working on for for these past 10

1725
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:46,300
years and also met other requirements

1726
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:50,090
than just getting it to run fast like

1727
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:53,900
robustness what happens if the note is

1728
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:55,700
not available and and so on so that's

1729
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,620
the infrastructure that we are we are we

1730
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:00,650
are working on and the next slides is

1731
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:03,620
actually some sort of a an attempt to to

1732
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:07,280
a key come with a class of use cases

1733
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:08,830
that needs a what we'll call privacy

1734
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,509
blockchain

1735
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:13,820
so as an economist is really all about

1736
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:16,070
taking a decision so you have two

1737
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,870
components you have alternatives and

1738
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:21,860
then you have some preferences on these

1739
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:24,470
alternatives so getting this big data or

1740
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:27,349
getting more data about the alternatives

1741
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,570
as well as you the Preferences of course

1742
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:33,710
makes it possible to make better

1743
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:36,139
decisions if you take into account the

1744
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:37,820
complexity of these decisions so you

1745
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:41,270
might have you have the overall

1746
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:44,150
strategic decision you you have the

1747
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:46,940
other end you have automated operational

1748
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:49,269
decisions that hopefully move you in the

1749
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:52,429
in the direction of your strategy so

1750
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:56,420
that's one problem to solve and then you

1751
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:58,130
everyone is part of some strategic

1752
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:02,960
interaction with a number of other

1753
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:04,790
partners you have privacy concerns there

1754
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,440
are regulatory concerns there's a number

1755
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:09,170
of concerns about these stations that

1756
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:12,410
should that realize these these better

1757
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:16,640
decisions so somehow we need to mitigate

1758
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:18,530
between keeping the Eastasia private and

1759
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,520
use the data to to make it better

1760
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:24,820
decisions so that is of course some core

1761
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,960
stuff though for economists and and this

1762
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:30,019
resource is actually one of the starting

1763
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,920
point for for petition is from result

1764
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:36,560
from 1979 so it's nothing new

1765
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,040
it's the revelation principle and it's

1766
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:45,100
it's kind of a nice small result that

1767
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:48,710
says okay with with you can have any

1768
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:51,740
mechanism if you could if you could

1769
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:54,530
instead of you being the strategic

1770
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:59,030
player you basically just tell the truth

1771
01:18:54,530 --> 01:19:03,620
to a impartial trusted third party that

1772
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:06,259
behaves in your interest and that's it's

1773
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:09,230
really easy to see that that can always

1774
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:11,420
be better than any mechanism so that's

1775
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:13,190
what economists use as a sort of

1776
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,830
theoretical basis for creating

1777
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:17,570
mechanisms so this is sort of the

1778
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:19,580
starting point and then you try to

1779
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,740
create your mechanisms that solve the

1780
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,960
real world problem but that's your

1781
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:27,620
benchmark and it's been more like a

1782
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,120
construct so personally when I heard

1783
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,890
about this technology for the first time

1784
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,080
it didn't take me many seconds to

1785
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:35,510
realize that this would be a fantastic

1786
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,580
technology which if you actually have

1787
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:40,250
what is called the social planar the

1788
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:44,260
impartial trusted third party then you

1789
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:49,070
could basically allocate the resources

1790
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:50,900
in a more efficient way in in general so

1791
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:58,120
I personally think this is a very strong

1792
01:19:50,900 --> 01:20:00,710
argument for for using for MPC so and

1793
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,960
that's mechanisms and mechanism is

1794
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:06,080
actually a way to certain navigate

1795
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,180
between which we use to organize the

1796
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:11,090
economy could be a contractual

1797
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:14,090
relationship with DVD society as such

1798
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:17,870
whether it's decentralized or

1799
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:20,510
centralized system which we have an

1800
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:24,700
option you actually set up the rules for

1801
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:27,500
how to do the the how to facilitate

1802
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:29,989
competition that solve some of the basic

1803
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,420
problems that you have in the economy

1804
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:36,039
whether you are in a decentralized or

1805
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:39,110
centralized well so that's that's pretty

1806
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:44,030
that's a lot of there's consensus about

1807
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:45,650
these problems whether you have the

1808
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:49,130
decent rise you will have the market

1809
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:54,289
failures in the central well you'll have

1810
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:56,630
the governmental failures and in both of

1811
01:20:54,289 --> 01:20:58,009
these well you have lack of information

1812
01:20:56,630 --> 01:21:01,130
which is creating a lot of these

1813
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:03,289
problems so that we are solving with the

1814
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:05,329
with the big data we get the artificial

1815
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:07,639
intelligence so we can map these

1816
01:21:05,329 --> 01:21:09,590
preferences map the alternatives and

1817
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:13,519
just put them together and here we go

1818
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:18,440
and we all have better decisions except

1819
01:21:13,519 --> 01:21:22,099
that there is some conference so the

1820
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:25,669
first one to the to the left is Google

1821
01:21:22,099 --> 01:21:28,429
Trent it's artificial intelligence

1822
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:32,749
competing with privacy who's interested

1823
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:35,059
in in most and on the other side is just

1824
01:21:32,749 --> 01:21:37,550
one of these many studies and Trust in

1825
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:42,110
Indiana trying to ask people about their

1826
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:45,889
trust in institutions in academia in

1827
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:49,070
researchers in global companies in

1828
01:21:45,889 --> 01:21:53,769
government's one of the challenges is

1829
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:58,549
that the logic the global companies and

1830
01:21:53,769 --> 01:22:01,630
the government which are usually those

1831
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:06,469
that would set up a system like this is

1832
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:10,010
not the most trusted institutions so you

1833
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:13,550
might actually need to maybe rebuild or

1834
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:15,739
build trust and and that the argument

1835
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:20,269
would be that that really requires some

1836
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:22,968
strong commitments and if you and that's

1837
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:26,059
what cryptography comes in if you commit

1838
01:22:22,969 --> 01:22:27,949
to a cryptographic protocol let's say we

1839
01:22:26,059 --> 01:22:30,760
are arguing for the no single point of

1840
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:37,039
trust that's really a strong commitment

1841
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:39,309
and use that TG to rebuild a trust so

1842
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:42,259
that's I think that's is where

1843
01:22:39,309 --> 01:22:45,620
cryptography has a super important

1844
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:50,570
in fixing maybe some of the most basic

1845
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:52,970
problems in just in both societies maybe

1846
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:56,179
at the moment at least an increasing

1847
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:58,040
problem so back to the to the

1848
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:01,489
infrastructure with the three components

1849
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:04,460
the the information that is publicly

1850
01:23:01,489 --> 01:23:06,110
available the smart contracts run

1851
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,880
computation and these information and

1852
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:10,960
the privacy measures you can actually

1853
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:14,060
implement these mechanisms that makes it

1854
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,750
met provide incentives for people to to

1855
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:22,310
make better decision you can combine

1856
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:24,890
this with the with when you have all of

1857
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:26,810
this and data analytics and these

1858
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:33,020
mechanisms and you can make these better

1859
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:37,720
decisions in a combination of this of

1860
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:47,210
these two technologies blockchain and CK

1861
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:53,110
computation so maybe two words about the

1862
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:55,220
the type of of market mechanisms or

1863
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:57,679
solution that you would typically look

1864
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,750
at so you would either consider some non

1865
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,989
collaborative solution over your

1866
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:06,650
competing about the winning and option

1867
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:08,809
competing in a negotiation there's a

1868
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:11,089
number of very of different non

1869
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:14,380
cooperative games but there's also a

1870
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:18,320
huge class of cooperative games which is

1871
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:21,830
maybe the class that could gain the most

1872
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:24,980
from an from a infrastructure like this

1873
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:28,430
and it's actually also in most cases

1874
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:32,929
where you can get the most values out of

1875
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:35,150
a collaboration by finding the the

1876
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:39,860
coalition finding the right person and

1877
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:43,309
make them collaborate there's a number

1878
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:47,179
of example of this farmers have done

1879
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:48,890
this for for many years I think I come

1880
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,210
from a country where this was like

1881
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:52,710
hundred and fifty years ago this is

1882
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:55,620
probably the basic of the

1883
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:57,810
the wealth generation that some small

1884
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:59,820
pool farmers went together and bought

1885
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:01,620
the equipment to process the in the milk

1886
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,860
and the meat and then they actually

1887
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:06,809
managed to create a lot of wealth this

1888
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:08,489
way that could have gone wrong in many

1889
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:11,340
different ways so he needed to

1890
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:13,709
concentrate all the wealth and if they

1891
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:15,840
had if they have had corrupt managers

1892
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:18,420
there was running away with the money

1893
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,400
then that would not have happened so

1894
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,680
that way you could do with a with an

1895
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:27,299
infrastructure like this you could make

1896
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:29,160
sure that you find the coalition in a

1897
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,190
privacy-preserving way and then

1898
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:38,160
implement the cost-sharing scheme or the

1899
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:39,960
revenue sharing schemes that one example

1900
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:43,080
so it doesn't have to be small players

1901
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:46,290
this is another example of the largest

1902
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:48,809
shipping companies that are too small

1903
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:52,350
for certain jobs so they could they do

1904
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:55,050
what is called tanker pools they they

1905
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:58,410
they pool the different ships that they

1906
01:25:55,050 --> 01:26:00,989
have for certain jobs and run a

1907
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:04,769
cooperative basically as a cost sharing

1908
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:07,110
and revenue sharing scheme taxi drivers

1909
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:09,510
and that example and then you you moving

1910
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:13,589
towards the watson non cooperative

1911
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:15,690
solutions energy system you need to make

1912
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:17,430
sure that make more room for renewable

1913
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:20,190
energy you need to combine a lot of

1914
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:21,800
resources that's also requires a lot of

1915
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:25,139
information a lot of price selling

1916
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:28,640
supply chain clearly bidding auctions

1917
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:34,140
some of the to negotiations mergers and

1918
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:38,670
acquisitions so this is some of the

1919
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:41,280
example of of classes of problems that

1920
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:45,660
could be solved by an infrastructure

1921
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:49,170
like this so we but we have soaked back

1922
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:52,170
with some of the basic chances that we

1923
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:54,510
and those of you have been trying to

1924
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:59,160
solve this most likely I would imagine

1925
01:26:54,510 --> 01:27:02,700
has faced that you need to find those

1926
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:04,950
that is running these notes and if you

1927
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,570
have a situation like the one with data

1928
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:09,960
broker you might have

1929
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:13,549
some natural opponents like the data

1930
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:16,440
requested the data providers you can run

1931
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:19,770
you can set up the system to run and

1932
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:22,049
never have to party problems you might

1933
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:25,080
have other situations where that is not

1934
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:27,240
possible so for the most of these cases

1935
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:29,820
you will have a generic you schedule

1936
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:31,440
where you will have a lot of players in

1937
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:33,840
the beginning a lot of information then

1938
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:39,120
you'll find some matches and then you

1939
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:42,570
see the execute the the decisions so in

1940
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:45,650
the in the first step you might need to

1941
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:48,990
delegate the trust to do some more

1942
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:51,839
generic type of notes that could be

1943
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:56,070
ready to run these computation whenever

1944
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:59,310
needed so who should those notes be and

1945
01:27:56,070 --> 01:28:01,290
that's you should go in and find some of

1946
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:05,940
the trustworthy institutions in the

1947
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:09,630
society and clearly there are some like

1948
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:13,500
like some industries are more trusted

1949
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:19,230
than others so you could try to organize

1950
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:22,560
these entities and make them basically

1951
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:26,309
allow them to profit on selling trusts

1952
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:29,640
in in a system like this you could also

1953
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:31,380
go to to public institution maybe that's

1954
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,540
the least and if you look at the

1955
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,070
government this is the United States but

1956
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:38,790
I think in this picture is pretty much

1957
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:40,980
the same in many other countries it's

1958
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:43,380
but there are other studies that is

1959
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:45,750
actually showing that there's a lot of

1960
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:47,850
trust in some of the institutions this

1961
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:49,560
is comparing the police whether you

1962
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:52,770
trust the police whether we trust other

1963
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:55,410
people say so there is a lot of trust

1964
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:57,180
out there so you could organize and you

1965
01:28:55,410 --> 01:29:00,300
if you have this sort of distributed

1966
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:03,420
cryptography this is actually a - - to

1967
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:08,010
create these social institutions great

1968
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:12,510
put these trusted institutions persons

1969
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:16,160
into networks and create even more trust

1970
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:21,620
and use that to realize some of these

1971
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:21,620
prospects in a data-driven economy

1972
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:26,219
and I think that was actually my

1973
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:28,679
conclusion so the conclusion is that

1974
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:32,090
okay this is this has been used I mean

1975
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:39,119
there's an increasing opportunity to use

1976
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:40,999
MPC to solve a number of problems and we

1977
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:44,518
would like you that there's a nice

1978
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:47,340
complementary in matched between the the

1979
01:29:44,519 --> 01:29:50,489
blockchain and the and the the MPC

1980
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:55,650
technology and that's what we're trying

1981
01:29:50,489 --> 01:29:57,780
to neutralize so exciting prospect that

1982
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:59,089
we could actually realize this data

1983
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:01,169
German economy and you know

1984
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:05,669
privacy-preserving

1985
01:30:01,169 --> 01:30:10,530
manner so this is not really new hal

1986
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:12,869
varian at 1995 he he wrote in in one of

1987
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:15,719
his papers who should be these

1988
01:30:12,869 --> 01:30:17,969
institutions that is safeguarding these

1989
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,999
these data that we had just talked about

1990
01:30:17,969 --> 01:30:27,110
in realizing the such a data turning

1991
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:30,139
economy I think that was that was it

1992
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,139
thank you

1993
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:43,020
we have time for questions hi my

1994
01:30:40,139 --> 01:30:44,579
question is why blockchain and wouldn't

1995
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,139
something like a trillion personality

1996
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:47,000
solve the same trust issues without all

1997
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:52,110
the hype

1998
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,909
hey let's go sneak predict my question

1999
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:55,710
was why blockchain and wouldn't

2000
01:30:53,909 --> 01:30:57,598
something like a trillion personality

2001
01:30:55,710 --> 01:31:00,320
solve the same trust issues without all

2002
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:02,940
the hype around the term blockchain yeah

2003
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:05,489
blockchain is is one solution so what

2004
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:08,040
we're trying to do is to utilize some of

2005
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:12,388
the things we think works well with with

2006
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:17,429
Brockton's we and combine that with what

2007
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:20,099
we think works well with with MPC we

2008
01:31:17,429 --> 01:31:23,070
don't want to just go in and maybe just

2009
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:25,440
take the first random notes in a public

2010
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:28,290
blockchain and have them running and an

2011
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:32,129
MPC so it's it's a different setting

2012
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:35,070
that we are focusing on yeah but I think

2013
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:36,630
that would be that would require a lot

2014
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:38,400
more information about this what we have

2015
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:42,030
building and we would like to sort of

2016
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:45,929
poke through on that a little more okay

2017
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:49,079
thank you hi you're claiming that you

2018
01:31:45,929 --> 01:31:53,150
use the blockchain to perform in PC I'm

2019
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:53,150
curious having worked on blockchain

2020
01:31:57,739 --> 01:32:06,928
technolon to kind of ensure the correct

2021
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:09,089
computation here because it doesn't

2022
01:32:06,929 --> 01:32:11,010
necessarily add any transparency unless

2023
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,810
you use what certain techniques Oh what

2024
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:15,210
techniques are you using to accomplish

2025
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:17,550
that transparency in comparison to like

2026
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:20,159
a cloud or just another trusted

2027
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:23,670
companies network that has physical

2028
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:26,429
security and stuff like that yeah so so

2029
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:28,110
that's what we what we would like to

2030
01:32:26,429 --> 01:32:31,260
present

2031
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:33,210
later stage for day you're presenting

2032
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,320
you later yes sir so that's what we are

2033
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,909
grading we're creating this

2034
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:39,030
infrastructure now so I've just sort of

2035
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:43,138
laying out the this new project in in

2036
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:45,960
some weak terms do you have a proof of

2037
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:48,239
concept up at all or yeah so we have the

2038
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:51,630
first proof of concept of the basic

2039
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:53,190
network so this is what we create so the

2040
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:54,869
two applications that I've talked about

2041
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:57,780
the tailor-made solution for the

2042
01:32:54,869 --> 01:33:00,449
blockchain and MPC that's one way of

2043
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:02,790
working with this several entities who's

2044
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:05,820
actually running a business using this

2045
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:07,800
technology then we say okay that looks

2046
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:09,570
that looks great we want to actually

2047
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,270
make it easier for others to do the same

2048
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:14,429
and and we have some some learned

2049
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:16,650
lessons from from this combination and

2050
01:33:14,429 --> 01:33:18,989
that's what we're using to create this

2051
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:22,650
infrastructure that mixes that combined

2052
01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:25,980
rock chain and MPC and the the more

2053
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:27,960
details about this first of all that's

2054
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:31,500
why I'm giving the talk I will not be

2055
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:34,350
able to reveal anything Susannah mr. so

2056
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:38,310
you'll you'll and we will need some more

2057
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:39,860
time to get the the basics in place but

2058
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:44,610
we do have actually a first

2059
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:55,409
implementation and you yes cool thank

2060
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:59,750
you thank you again and have a good

2061
01:33:55,409 --> 01:33:59,750
build we can reconvene at 2:00 p.m.
