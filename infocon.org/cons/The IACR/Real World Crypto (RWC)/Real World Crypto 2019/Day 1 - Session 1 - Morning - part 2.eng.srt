1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
but not the first talk of the second

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,459
session and it's going to be the hill we

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,910
must dial so over to you guys thanks

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,139
great

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,240
good morning everybody

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,609
thanks so much for coming here and the

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,009
telev is a hill we must die on

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,140
cryptographers and Congress who are we

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,420
I'm Gabe Kaptchuk I'm a fourth-year PhD

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,090
student at Johns Hopkins and I'm

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,640
co-advised by avi Rubin and Matt green

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,200
and and I am an American which is

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
important for the context of this talk

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,809
and I'm Shannon Connie I'm a fifth year

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,450
PhD student at Panik also in

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,640
cryptography advised by Nadia Henninger

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,860
and Jonathan Smith and I am actually

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,020
Australian which is interesting for

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:54,600
today's talk and we work together in

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,750
Senator Ron Wyden s personal office in

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,090
Washington DC he's a US federal senator

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,609
he's a Democrat and from Oregon neither

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,589
of us had prior political experience or

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,229
really much policy experience before

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,939
going into our summer experience but

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,490
both of us come from research groups

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,048
that do have interests in policy even

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,820
while they're actually dedicated to the

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,299
technical work rather than to the policy

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,949
side so before we get into the meat of

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,840
the talk itself I wanted to make sure

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,250
that we kind of set some parameters in

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,350
terms of what this talk will be and what

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,460
it will not be first of all this talk is

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,110
going to be very different than the ones

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,470
in the preceding group you're not going

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,329
to see any key exchange diagrams here

38
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,189
this is not going to be a advertisement

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,199
for a particular set of political views

40
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,279
we did both work in a democratic office

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,290
but we're going to try and make this

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,210
sort of broad enough that everybody can

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,560
take away the best way to advocate for

44
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,710
the cryptographic community no matter

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,299
what your personal beliefs are this is

46
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,710
not going to be a talk about the merits

47
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,810
and evils of exceptional access

48
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,850
mechanisms I know we could all talk

49
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,990
about that all day but we really want to

50
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,579
keep this sort of away from the

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,860
hot-button issues and talk about the

52
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,529
best way to sort of approach the process

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,000
of interacting with government similarly

54
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,770
this is not going to be a u.s. civics

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,260
lecture so don't worry you don't get to

56
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,280
take a nap wait yet

57
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,509
we want to make sure that everybody in

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,160
the room is able to take something away

59
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,859
and bring it back to their home country

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,000
even if it's not the United States

61
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,500
obviously the context that we worked in

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,840
is very us centric and so we're gonna be

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,370
using that for a lot of examples but the

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,980
takeaways themselves are sort of broader

65
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,410
than that and can be applied to

66
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,780
virtually any country and lastly this

67
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,640
talk is not a view into what's secretly

68
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,470
happening in the Senate we can't tell

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,170
you all the things that we did which is

70
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,220
a fun thing to say but we are going to

71
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,530
be able to sort of give you the flavor

72
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,910
of the things that we worked on and give

73
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,730
you an insight into how things work

74
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,040
within the federal government

75
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,630
this talk is finally two perspectives on

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,870
what we learned from our summer on

77
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,310
Capitol Hill so what motivated our

78
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,570
desire to go into policy and what should

79
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,130
what is one of the things that maybe

80
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,650
should motivate you so we have this nice

81
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,299
full quote from Philip Roth away's paper

82
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,610
on the moral nature of cryptographic

83
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,180
work and he's essentially saying that

84
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,520
cryptic cryptography and power are

85
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,950
inextricably intertwined cryptography is

86
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,630
an inherently political tool and thus it

87
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,549
should be relevant a relevant

88
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,769
consideration for all of us to think

89
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,110
about the implications of what our work

90
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,920
produces in a broader policy and

91
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,590
political context so why work in policy

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,510
otherwise so governments struggle with

93
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,620
complex systems I'm sure many of you saw

94
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,109
the Facebook hearings and our elected

95
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,120
officials in the US were manifestly

96
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,060
unable to grapple with some of the

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,730
complex issues that are now forefront in

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,950
the minds of many individuals both in

99
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,280
America and around the world governments

100
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,959
also set trends so not just in America

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
but governments set standards that are

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,790
often adopted by industry and so the

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,400
ramifications are broader than just laws

104
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,700
and regulations that may be set that

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,700
impacts our technical lives as well as

106
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,980
our everyday lives and also the loudest

107
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,200
voices that control a lot of policy

108
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,329
debates today aren't technical devices

109
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,190
and in the case of cryptography there

110
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,350
are very few voices from our community

111
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,139
that make themselves heard when it comes

112
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,630
to discussions in Capitol Hill outside

113
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,130
of the one or two hot-button issues that

114
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,900
everyone is used to talking

115
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,940
and finally working in policy gives you

116
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,250
a chance to really magnify the impact of

117
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,370
your technical work so while our

118
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,570
research papers are broadly disseminated

119
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,490
within the community and shape industry

120
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,280
working in policy gives us a chance to

121
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,000
magnify our impact through advising

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,250
lawmakers and policy setters on

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,440
different ways that research advances

124
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,050
can shape their understandings and

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,120
present both costs and opportunities to

126
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,890
the broader community so a little taste

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,900
of us civics for those of you who aren't

128
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,550
familiar so that we can help give you

129
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,429
some perspective on what we were doing

130
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,850
so the United States government is

131
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,410
broadly divided up into three different

132
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,010
branches enumerated in the Constitution

133
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,810
and the kind of core concept here is the

134
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,969
idea of checks and balances each of

135
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,430
these branches is going to have powers

136
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,490
that impact the others and work together

137
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,010
to provide a way of making sure that

138
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,500
there's no overreach in terms of powers

139
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,330
so two of the branches that we'll start

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,460
with the judicial branch which

141
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,370
interprets the laws and applies laws to

142
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,310
cases and the executive branch which

143
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,260
actually execute the laws so this would

144
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,410
be things like all your government

145
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:48,960
agencies the IRS customs and border

146
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:50,670
control NIST is part of the executive

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,650
branch which some of you may be familiar

148
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,540
with and we would love to give you a

149
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,570
live demo of calling up the executive

150
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,760
branch and and showing how to work in

151
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,800
policy but unfortunately they don't seem

152
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,310
to be in the office at the moment so

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,720
maybe we'll give a pass on that one and

154
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,270
the third branch which is the one where

155
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,760
we worked is the legislative branch so

156
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,479
the legislative branch is most commonly

157
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,990
known for making and writing laws and

158
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,510
passing them many US schoolchildren are

159
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,700
familiar with this little cartoon bill

160
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,950
which passes through the legislative

161
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,710
process ins made laws as made into a law

162
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,169
by Congress however the other really

163
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,090
important function of the legislative

164
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,620
branch that many people often overlook

165
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,090
is the oversight function so Congress is

166
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,190
tasked with overseeing the other two

167
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,380
branches and has various powers that

168
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,660
enable this oversight function such as

169
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,730
the ability to requisition documents and

170
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,210
issue subpoenas and hold public hearings

171
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,950
in order to perform investigative and

172
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,840
oversight functions that ensure the

173
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,370
other two branches are doing what they

174
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,109
say they are doing

175
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,540
and finally we worked in a Senate office

176
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,460
a personal office of a senator so this

177
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,900
is the senator chooses which staff

178
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,700
members he's going to hire he or she and

179
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,888
these are each of these staffers are

180
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,750
divided up into issue areas the

181
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,240
particular staffers that control a

182
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,889
policy area are known as legislative

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,250
aides and we work to underneath one of

184
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,350
those the staff will identify problems

185
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,780
and issues and suggest to the senator

186
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,919
what stances he or she should take and

187
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:34,650
they derive their the set of issues they

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,960
identify issues often through the media

189
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,330
through consultation with experts that

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,799
they happen to know with lobbyists who

191
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,380
come in advocating for particular

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,460
positions and constituent concerns that

193
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,080
are forwarded to the office so going

194
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,239
into the summer both of us wanted to

195
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,919
have some goals set for ourselves and I

196
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,960
think we've sort of laid out a short

197
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,460
list of goals that we had that sort of

198
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,289
contextualized some of the lessons we

199
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,659
were able to learn as we left our summer

200
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,280
experience so first of all what are the

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,860
ground rules for doing work in

202
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,179
government as both PhD students were

203
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,800
very familiar with sort of the academic

204
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,389
ground rules tried to evaluate the value

205
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,860
of a citation for instance is something

206
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,770
that we can kind of get on board with

207
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,510
but try to understand how you push

208
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,070
issues around how do you talk to people

209
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,960
and really what are the rules in which

210
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,310
people are able to do work in the

211
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,520
legislative branch was something we both

212
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,340
want to come away with secondly can two

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,650
people make a substantive impact at all

214
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,900
so we were two people working at the

215
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,870
Fellow level sort of you know unpaid

216
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,179
people and and we wanted to gauge how

217
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,709
much actual impact we could have both in

218
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,309
our community but also sort of in the

219
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:43,468
general legislative process very key

220
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,180
takeaway is was there any overlap

221
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,770
between academically interesting

222
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,060
problems and policy interesting

223
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,550
and I think this is often times where we

224
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,529
see a breakdown where members of our

225
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,750
community are not super willing to jump

226
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,279
into the political sphere because they

227
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,110
don't necessarily see the same issues as

228
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,750
interesting right and so trying to find

229
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,860
an overlap there so we can really sink

230
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,800
our teeth into the issues that the

231
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,140
political arena is interested in and

232
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
finally how can we best represent our

233
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,380
community right what steps can we take

234
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,910
in terms of teaching each other and

235
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,810
learning on our own such that we can

236
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,640
best represent the cryptographic

237
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,910
community when it comes to a political

238
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,260
stage so what did we actually do well

239
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,640
this is what our parents thought we did

240
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,020
they thought we kind of just walked

241
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,100
around the hill and took nice pictures

242
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,779
and got to see all kinds of famous

243
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,730
people walking around unfortunately

244
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,040
there was work to be done so we had to

245
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,830
do more than just that um what did our

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,209
managers actually think we do well as I

247
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,070
said before we can't tell you all the

248
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,899
secret things but this is kind of coming

249
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,820
into overlapping interests right other

250
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,339
interests that are similar between our

251
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,839
work and and what the alleged branch

252
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,399
actually cares about so we came in kind

253
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,320
of caring about the things that I think

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,360
many people would care about widespread

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,850
crypto protocol deployment right stuff

256
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,790
like the Phipps standards stuff like

257
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,230
government CAS and TLS right and all of

258
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,910
us have probably experienced clicking on

259
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,680
a DoD website Department of Defense

260
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,689
website and getting a big warning that

261
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,660
says you cannot go here I mean trying to

262
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,089
figure out why this is old and outdated

263
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,110
VPN protocols I'm sort of making sure

264
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,579
that everybody and the government is

265
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,160
using stuff that's you know genuinely

266
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,120
and and powerfully secure we also cared

267
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,339
a lot about government transparency

268
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,050
which I believe lot of people in this

269
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,459
room care about we're not going to talk

270
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,810
about that because I said the beginning

271
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,359
we're not going to talk too much about

272
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,979
some of the hot button issues um what

273
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,220
did our senator and and their staff care

274
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,810
about they carried a ton about HTTPS and

275
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,490
to say disablement and this

276
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,770
configuration on agency websites and

277
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,660
notice that this is a widespread crypto

278
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,939
protocol right so there is some overlap

279
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,170
here those sort of the details of what

280
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,600
they cared about are somewhat different

281
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,319
um lack of start TLS for optimistic

282
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,070
email encryption cared a lot about FBI

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,529
misrepresenting decryption details

284
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,000
around phones and mobile devices they

285
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,680
cared a lot about voting which we're

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,410
gonna hear a lot more about in just a

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,300
moment um notice that there's a lot of

288
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,680
overlap between these two groups but

289
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,540
it's not exactly the same right so there

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,420
still are interesting issues that we can

291
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,689
work together with so what is the actual

292
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,790
data

293
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,620
they look like well we wrote lots and

294
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,730
lots of letters letters are not

295
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,960
necessarily the thing that you think of

296
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,490
immediately when you think of the

297
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,220
legislative branch we oftentimes think

298
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,150
about a legislation but the way that

299
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,530
most Congress persons get their message

300
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,420
out is by writing these letters some of

301
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,589
them are very pleasant letters you may

302
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,760
have noticed that out of the Wyden

303
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,130
office over the course of summer there

304
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,660
is a nice little letter encouraging the

305
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,400
use of wire guard and maybe looking at

306
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,719
new VPN protocols I'm not going to say

307
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,569
that we were involved in that but you

308
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,620
know you can make your own conclusions

309
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,180
there was also some angry letters that

310
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,980
went out right there was a letter that

311
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,319
went out from the Wyden office as well

312
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,910
when domain fronting the the domain

313
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,190
fronting policies were changed at Google

314
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,050
and Amazon that was not the most

315
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,430
pleasant letter to read right so both

316
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,050
this were kind of pushing people in

317
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,969
industry to take a hard look at what

318
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,530
they're doing but also I'm encouraging

319
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,540
people within the government to make

320
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,880
good choices we also the opportunity to

321
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,160
draft some legislation there was a bill

322
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,810
introduced by the Wyden office just

323
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,939
after the summer which had to do with

324
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,469
data privacy and changing the way that

325
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,490
we think about data privacy in this

326
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,900
country we also conducted cryptographic

327
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,800
investigations and which kind of means

328
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,240
we just looked around to see where

329
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,650
things were broken in the government

330
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,630
which is surprisingly a lot of places

331
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,860
and we got to advise senior staff

332
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,270
whenever an issue came into the office

333
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,060
that was sort of relevant to data

334
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,260
privacy or crypt or something like that

335
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,369
another really important power was

336
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,930
actually getting to meet with people

337
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,580
from industry and different government

338
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,959
agencies and I'll talk a little bit more

339
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,880
about that in a second and we're really

340
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,370
the biggest thing that we did was we

341
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,960
argued we argued a lot and was kind of

342
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,670
nice as being an environment where the

343
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,200
two of us had similar views on many

344
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,880
things but very different views on other

345
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,140
things and we got to kind of yell at

346
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,670
each other and work through these issues

347
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,990
in a space where we were encouraged to

348
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,959
kind of grapple with the political

349
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,950
ramifications of what we were doing one

350
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,780
thing that was really nice is this

351
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,920
arguing actually in my opinion was

352
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,600
really productive

353
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,550
we actually got things done in kind of

354
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,260
clarified our issues which was really

355
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,180
relieving every once in a while in our

356
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,030
field topics tend to get a little bit

357
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,599
heated and we don't necessarily always

358
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,010
get to the bottom of things um Matt

359
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,640
green is my adviser I cleared this joke

360
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,620
don't worry at all good a highlight for

361
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,839
me and for both of us was actually got

362
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,410
to sit down with a bunch of high-level

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,070
people from the NSA one thing that the

364
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,969
that they were

365
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,200
able to say is that the officials at sat

366
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,190
down across from us that thought it was

367
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,270
really refreshing to have the

368
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,980
opportunity to have a direct

369
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,860
conversation with members of the

370
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,570
academic crypto cryptographic community

371
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,800
which was a really refreshing thing to

372
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,080
hear and I thought it was actually a

373
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,390
really productive meeting I will say

374
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,580
that and you know it's a little bit

375
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,020
unnerving that we were the two faces

376
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,330
that they saw as representatives of the

377
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,280
academic cryptographic community and so

378
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,590
maybe that reflects some of the work we

379
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,910
have to do as a community beyond that

380
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,160
unfortunately I'm not able to disclose

381
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,310
any of the details of this meeting but

382
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,810
feel free to buy us drinks later we

383
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:56,849
still won't disclose any of the details

384
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,609
so a couple of takeaways which we want

385
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,980
to give to you from our time there so

386
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,680
number one is crypto is everywhere this

387
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,650
isn't just in crypto standards like hips

388
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,500
or in places where it's most obvious a

389
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,870
nice example is the Census departments

390
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,430
use of differential privacy for the 2020

391
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,580
census a really interesting use of

392
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,709
cryptography and related techniques

393
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,990
cryptography also extends to use of a

394
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,600
large number of government services as

395
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,820
things are increasingly digitized things

396
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,380
like visa lotteries are controlled by

397
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,600
random number generators which leads to

398
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,660
a whole lot of interesting problems in

399
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,370
the cryptography space that overlap with

400
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,660
government which we don't always

401
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:42,150
consider lesson number two is that talk

402
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,800
is really cheap but ultimately is very

403
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:48,500
powerful and a lot of politics

404
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,120
particularly in the United States is

405
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,310
kind of performance-based right and the

406
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,560
things that we see our politicians do

407
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,359
are very much intended to be steamed by

408
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,619
the public right a good example of this

409
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
is hearings right when you hold a

410
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,040
hearing it's not actually so much for

411
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,290
the Senators to learn new information

412
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,390
from the people who understand it's for

413
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,310
the rest of us to hear the questions and

414
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,660
the answers and kind of engage in the

415
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,699
political process right and so this

416
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,360
makes the speech itself really the

417
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,620
biggest currency on Capitol Hill I think

418
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,910
there's kind of a big trophy at money is

419
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,020
the most powerful thing and after a

420
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,640
summer there that that really wasn't

421
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,650
true it was all about your ability to

422
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,500
convey an important message and have a

423
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,720
conversation importantly politicians

424
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,030
actually really do

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,380
and they have the opportunity sorry let

426
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,120
us say when they have the opportunity to

427
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,740
sit down with a constituent with an

428
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,060
expert they actually do kind of glean

429
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,430
information and it shapes the way that

430
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,140
they see issues oftentimes they don't

431
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,760
have the time to sit down with every

432
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,020
single person who comes in so their

433
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,300
staff has the opportunity to sit down

434
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,680
and staff are generally a little bit

435
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,510
more informed in whatever your issue

436
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,189
areas so for us sitting down with

437
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,990
somebody who's at least familiar with

438
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,700
the issues in the encryption or in the

439
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,460
crypto space is a much more helpful

440
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,840
conversation to have anyway it's not

441
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,660
particularly hard to actually get a

442
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,190
meeting you can kind of call or send a

443
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,760
note and channel talk a little bit more

444
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,730
about that in a moment and importantly

445
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,920
the conversations that you have with

446
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,030
representatives or with their staff can

447
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,380
just be seen as ideas right they don't

448
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,780
immediately need to lead to action and

449
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,910
they can sort of slowly bubble and

450
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,150
eventually come up into a law further

451
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,770
down the road there's some sort of

452
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,780
guidelines to take away when it comes to

453
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,850
the media right you remember the the

454
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,730
representative is not going to read your

455
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,500
paper and they likely won't read your

456
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,460
Twitter or whatever your way of

457
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,110
spreading your message out into the

458
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,480
world is but their legislative aide

459
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,040
actually is very likely to see your work

460
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,780
if you're doing a good job sort of

461
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,800
publicizing it and making it known I

462
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,040
mean that's a good way to sort of

463
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,390
influence a conversation in the office

464
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,560
some priorities that we that we have and

465
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,230
thinking about the way that speech is

466
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,670
regulated and number one don't make the

467
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,380
member look bad number two make the

468
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,900
number look good number three really

469
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,370
don't make the member look bad this was

470
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,439
given to us on our first day on the job

471
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,410
by the legislative aide we're working

472
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,580
with we kind of like to just extrapolate

473
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,119
this a little bit and say you know don't

474
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,860
do bad do good and and don't do that so

475
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,079
lesson number three you learn to talk

476
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,119
like the other kind of nerd the other

477
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,649
kind of wonk so they're on really

478
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,389
cryptographers wandering the halls of

479
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,579
Congress no one's gonna listen to you on

480
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:21,380
us idh key exchange proposal but you

481
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,659
there's still a way to communicate the

482
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,339
value and importance of ideas one way to

483
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,140
do this is to think about the mindset

484
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,330
through which politicians operate

485
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,610
because their constituents often don't

486
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,590
think in terms of deep subtleties you've

487
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,080
got to think about the way to portray

488
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,879
something either as good and contrast

489
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,580
that with something that might be bad so

490
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,130
for example TLS 1.3

491
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,750
good SSL v2 bad and so when you are

492
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,610
presenting issues to the Congress person

493
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,160
try and present it in a way that they

494
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,270
will then be able to absorb it and be be

495
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,700
able to communicate to their

496
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:59,090
constituents master the art of the

497
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,920
concrete ask is so telling the member

498
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,419
that hey you know you should really

499
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,220
improve your crypto protocol because

500
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,110
forward secrecy is really important

501
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,110
probably isn't going to get them going

502
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,120
but saying you know government agency X

503
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,370
isn't implementing forward secrecy

504
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,860
properly can you please get them to

505
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,629
enable can please get them to change

506
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,040
their configuration in this way to do it

507
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,560
that is something that's much more

508
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,830
likely to get done so here are some

509
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,960
examples of easier things to get your

510
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,929
member to do and some harder things I'm

511
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,600
not gonna go into great detail but come

512
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,160
up and talk to us after about that so

513
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,990
communicating with a member there are

514
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,330
three primary channels through which you

515
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,040
can do this number one is call and if

516
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,629
you call and just give an opinion you're

517
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,790
actually gonna be put forward in the

518
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,010
u.s. to an LC that's someone who just

519
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,750
communicates with constituents however

520
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,730
you should know that you can ask for the

521
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,830
staffer that handles your particular

522
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,120
issue area and this is really the

523
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,949
valuable thing because that's when you

524
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,449
can get connected to someone who's going

525
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,940
to approach the issue more directly

526
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,430
rather than just taking your one line

527
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,110
good or bad kind of feedback you can

528
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,210
then also ask for a meeting with the

529
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,800
staffer who oversees a particular issue

530
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,410
and this is a great chance to get your

531
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,180
point across and then one of the bigger

532
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,220
currencies in Congress is the

533
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,470
Congressional letter so knowing how to

534
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,650
format and write your letters in order

535
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,420
to communicate is really powerful one

536
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,860
thing one kind of Boogie word in our

537
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,300
community that we try to avoid is this

538
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,520
word incremental you don't ever want to

539
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,050
do incremental work right um but

540
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,550
unfortunately that's not Linda bleah the

541
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,379
best way to approach issues when coming

542
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,720
to the legislative branch big-ticket

543
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,610
issues the sexy issues oftentimes have a

544
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,780
lot of enemies right and so when you

545
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,629
asked representative hey can you take

546
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,430
action on issue X it's unlikely that

547
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,900
they'll may get much headway done if

548
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,120
it's an issue where there's a lot of

549
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,470
vested stakeholders right and and sort

550
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,030
of building compromise on these lo

551
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,400
issues is what's gonna get you progress

552
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm so some good examples of problems is

553
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,510
hey we should be using MPC for social

554
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,100
good and that's kind of specific we're

555
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,500
gonna be hearing

556
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,629
about that later why does the government

557
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,130
misconfigure TLS in the certain place

558
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,990
right and the industry standards for

559
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,190
some particular phone protocol whatever

560
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,270
it is is broken and it's affecting a

561
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,880
population right so there's a real

562
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,250
impact and a very narrow scope it's much

563
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,320
harder to go you know don't back to our

564
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,210
crypto there's a lot of stakeholders

565
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,370
there and people are gonna get angry I'm

566
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,190
not gonna talk about more about that so

567
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,070
finally what can you do so if you're an

568
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,780
academic as many people here are embrace

569
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,580
the political and moral nature of your

570
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,530
work find a way to tell the stories

571
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,928
about how your work is going to impact

572
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,360
other people and use that to shape the

573
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,340
policy narrative consider doing some

574
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,289
work for your legislative branch that

575
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,490
might be helping out on a letter or it

576
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,590
might be helping out with some

577
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,330
legislation or even sending two of your

578
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,459
students to work on the hill for a

579
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,168
summer and be active in learning how to

580
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,690
talk about you're working on technically

581
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,640
if you're an industry again many of

582
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,880
these same skills are applicable reach

583
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,490
beyond perhaps your particular narrow

584
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,470
field and bring in a broader consensus

585
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,720
that you can then present to a

586
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,640
legislative body to present really good

587
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,890
ideas on how government can help improve

588
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,020
the state of cryptography and again tell

589
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,210
the same stories about how what you're

590
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,658
doing can improve privacy and security

591
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,590
for a members constituents and finally

592
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:15,610
if you are a concerned human please like

593
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,168
everyone else has always been telling

594
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,110
you take part in your political process

595
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,760
and be active reach out to either of us

596
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,280
if you have any more questions or

597
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,840
thoughts thank you to our sponsors for

598
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,510
the summer and thank you to Senator

599
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,699
Wyden and his staff and our and the

600
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,060
other fellows for facilitating our

601
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,240
summer thank you thank you

602
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,240
[Applause]

603
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,000
yes we have we have time for one quick

604
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,419
one or two quick questions I've got a

605
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,880
question

606
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,230
so these NSA people they'd never talk to

607
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,110
an academic before haven't they heard of

608
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,580
a telephone I actually can't tell you

609
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,899
what was said in the meeting we might

610
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,830
have asked about telephones but I can't

611
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,630
tell you okay any other questions

612
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,960
okay let's thank speaks again and let's

613
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,840
move on thank you

614
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,900
[Applause]

615
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,899
[Music]

616
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:47,830
hope it works trailer I'll signal when

617
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,640
it's like a few minutes okay good we're

618
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,490
almost there

619
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,500
so apparently crypto means cryptography

620
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:59,230
so I hand over to Matt okay so thanks so

621
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,660
that last talk I saw some news but that

622
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,370
less talk was so persuasive I've decided

623
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,660
to quit my job as an engineering

624
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:10,270
professor and joined the faculty at the

625
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,429
Georgetown Law School and focus on

626
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,520
technology and policy so thanks I've had

627
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:18,100
a huge change in my life but it's you

628
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,100
know you guys that was a great talk so

629
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,459
I'm glad I got in ahead of the game on

630
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,770
on on running to do policy work at least

631
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,700
part of the time so this talk is gonna

632
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,190
be about the role of cryptography and

633
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,230
elections and voting and it's very short

634
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,669
there really isn't so thank you very

635
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,650
much

636
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,919
and I'm going to talk a little bit about

637
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,520
why so this is basically to convince you

638
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,440
that elections are a really important

639
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,110
problem for us to be working on but

640
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,150
maybe not in some of the ways that we've

641
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:56,110
traditionally been working on them as a

642
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:59,500
as a community so the role of Technology

643
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,240
in elections has a very long history and

644
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,090
I'm going to apologize that this is

645
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,370
going to be a very us centric talk but a

646
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,649
lot of the things are applicable in

647
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,939
other parts of the world as well and

648
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,669
some of the problems are really

649
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,450
fundamental to democratic elections in

650
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:18,700
the democratic process so in fact early

651
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,890
elections in the United States were

652
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,990
pretty informal in the way they were

653
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,910
conducted they consisted of little more

654
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,299
than getting people together in the Town

655
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:31,120
Hall and having them raise their hands

656
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,770
about who their candidates were the

657
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,959
problem with that the reason we don't

658
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,940
really do that today for big public

659
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,299
civil elections is that it doesn't scale

660
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,419
well

661
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:42,560
and so technological mechanisms have

662
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,920
increasingly been used

663
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,350
and these technological mechanisms

664
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,690
quietly have properties some of them

665
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:55,010
security properties that some of them

666
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,890
good some of them bad that we've kind of

667
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,440
taken to become requirements and one of

668
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,010
the examples of that is the secrecy you

669
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,280
can't find out how someone else voted

670
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:09,500
and in fact you can't even prove that

671
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,460
you voted in a particular way and that's

672
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,930
regarded as a really important

673
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,110
requirement and we've evolved the

674
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,450
technology that we use in elections

675
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:23,149
earliest in the United States with

676
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,740
probably the use of paper ballots fill

677
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,440
out your ballot form put it into a box

678
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,240
and at the end of the day we've watched

679
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,160
the Box carefully and then we watch

680
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,250
everybody take the ballots out and count

681
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,990
them and that gives us confidence that

682
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,970
every vote that was put in the box

683
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:43,360
ultimately gets counted but we don't

684
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:46,220
actually tie who voted to a particular

685
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,040
ballot once it's come out of the box and

686
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,630
so that has some very interesting

687
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:55,389
security and privacy properties that

688
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:58,040
have really become fundamental to how we

689
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,980
think about requirements for a

690
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,879
democratic election we've moved on to

691
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,370
machine counted ballots of various kinds

692
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,400
partly because we want results quickly

693
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:13,909
and accurately and sometimes we achieve

694
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:18,050
that and sometimes we don't we've moved

695
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:20,930
on to machine cast ballots of lever

696
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:25,040
voting machines that were used in some

697
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,360
places or in punch card ballot machines

698
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,690
and I'll talk about those in a little

699
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,360
bit electromechanical voting mechanisms

700
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,840
and then finally and this is really a

701
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,959
21st century or largely a 21st century

702
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,040
phenomenon voting computers using

703
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,370
computers to actually cast your ballot

704
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,520
and ultimately public confidence in the

705
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,310
integrity of our elections and in in who

706
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,410
our elected officials are are our belief

707
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,730
in the outcome of elections is something

708
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:59,769
we rely on

709
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,840
has is now traceable in an increasingly

710
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:04,639
strong way to our confidence in the

711
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,370
underlying technology of the election

712
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:09,949
itself and so the technology issues have

713
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,100
become really important as a building

714
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:15,889
block of our democracy so we should

715
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,049
think a lot about what the requirements

716
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:20,269
are and whether our systems achieve

717
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:21,889
those requirements so I'm gonna talk a

718
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:23,630
little bit about these requirements I

719
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:25,519
will say I've been working in computers

720
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,380
across computer security and

721
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,380
cryptography and that kind of stuff for

722
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,110
25-30 years now and I have yet to

723
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,690
encounter a problem nearly as difficult

724
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:39,168
as voting in civil elections it's it's

725
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:41,539
the hardest practical real-world problem

726
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,429
I've ever seen and and I think there are

727
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:47,720
fundamental reasons for this I'm gonna

728
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:49,159
focus on two of them one is that some of

729
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,340
the requirements are in conflict with

730
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,260
each other and a big one is the secrecy

731
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,299
requirement I can't find out how anyone

732
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,760
else voted and in fact I can't even

733
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,559
prove that I voted a particular way and

734
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,379
that protects me against being coerced

735
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,210
to vote in a particular way because I

736
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,500
just have no way of showing that I voted

737
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:11,750
one way or another and but I also want

738
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,059
confidence that my vote actually was

739
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,799
counted at the end of the day so we have

740
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,928
this strong requirement for audit

741
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,240
ability and a strong requirement for

742
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,690
kind of a lack of audible audit ability

743
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,029
at the same time and this is we care

744
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,250
about both of these things very much but

745
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:30,380
you know ultimately when you make that a

746
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,269
technical requirement if it seems like

747
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,399
it's really hard to achieve both of

748
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,990
these things and the second problem

749
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,039
which is even harder than the

750
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,570
contradictory requirements is that

751
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:46,250
ultimately particularly in the United

752
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:48,100
States it's insufficient to merely

753
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,779
detect that there was an election

754
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,209
irregularity it's almost impossible to

755
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,950
have a do-over election if you discover

756
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,940
that the integrity of the election has

757
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,139
been compromised

758
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:02,510
then what do you hold a do-over election

759
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,740
well there may not be legal mechanisms

760
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:08,330
to do that it's extraordinarily

761
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:09,090
difficult in in the United States to do

762
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,460
that and it

763
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,070
unclear that it would even be fair to do

764
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,659
that under most circumstances because

765
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,549
how do you make sure that everybody who

766
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,519
took the time to vote the first time is

767
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,639
able to vote the second time and and so

768
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,870
on and so you know mechanisms that

769
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,240
merely say aha

770
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:30,418
well this cryptographic hash will be

771
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,919
different from the ultimate outcome and

772
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,490
that shows that there was some tampering

773
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,159
are incredibly unsatisfying in the

774
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:42,119
context of actual real world elections

775
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,929
we want recovery and and find out what

776
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:48,350
the true outcome was at the same time we

777
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:51,059
have incredibly high stakes for

778
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,610
elections in the United States we spend

779
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:56,549
much more money on political campaigns

780
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,139
trying to influence who votes to

781
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:59,809
convince people to vote one way or

782
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:03,748
another then we actually spend

783
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:06,450
conducting the election mechanics itself

784
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:08,539
and there is a long history of mischief

785
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,639
almost always at the local level

786
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:14,669
elections for mayor or dogcatcher or

787
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:18,689
City Council are actually historically

788
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:23,190
much more prone to somebody trying to

789
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:26,129
sell the the office than large national

790
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,619
offices and you know Trigg the

791
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:30,719
traditional threat model has been to

792
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,090
prevent a corrupt candidate or a corrupt

793
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,519
candidates supporters from being able to

794
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:42,029
influence the election in 2016 we had

795
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,039
put into focus very clearly that that's

796
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,779
not the entire threat model that the

797
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:51,509
threat model is larger than that and

798
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:54,480
includes very definite eight actors that

799
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:56,669
may want to in either influence the

800
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,190
election or do something that may

801
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:01,499
actually be easier than influencing the

802
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,320
election which is merely disrupting an

803
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:09,259
election or reducing our confidence in

804
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,299
the outcome and so state actors have the

805
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:13,950
two inherent advantages here first they

806
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,139
have resources that are likely to be

807
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:20,519
greater than any candidate and greater

808
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:22,500
than any election local election board

809
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,570
is going to have and

810
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,340
also have an easier task they don't

811
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,620
necessarily need to pick the winner all

812
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,720
they need to do is reduce our confidence

813
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,520
in who the winner is

814
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:39,240
and that is you know really a great

815
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,820
advantage to the adversary and a real

816
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,660
difficult problem for the defender so

817
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,939
let's look at the question of whether

818
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,830
new voting technology is going to enable

819
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,630
some of this kinds of mischief or

820
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,879
prevent some of this kind of mischief

821
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:57,030
and the answer is yes it does

822
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,330
so elections in the United States first

823
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:04,020
of all we have a very highly distributed

824
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:06,149
hierarchy of how elections are conducted

825
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:10,830
the federal government really sets very

826
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:12,570
broad standards there are four things

827
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,840
like well you know people are allowed to

828
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:18,030
vote and you know here's the age for

829
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,340
voting and you know you get to vote in

830
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,550
your state and so on but all of the

831
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,129
details are left to the states in

832
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,990
practice and part of the reason for that

833
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,120
is the constitutional principle called

834
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,490
federalism and there are also practical

835
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,919
reasons that that's simply where the

836
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:38,910
mechanisms are each state has its own

837
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,190
set of laws and rules and practices for

838
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,860
the specifics of this administered in

839
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,810
almost every case by an official usually

840
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:50,459
called the Secretary of State of the

841
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:53,250
state elections though are in almost all

842
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,590
of these states run by the individual

843
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:59,430
counties that's the most typical

844
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,379
granularity for who is actually going to

845
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:07,530
buy the voting machines and count the

846
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:09,780
ballots and get the voters to to

847
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,580
actually vote in most states that's

848
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,180
that's going to be your local County

849
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,210
that does that there are 3,000 counties

850
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,110
in the United States roughly so that

851
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,700
means really we have 3,000 or so

852
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,770
election administrators by that count in

853
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,660
fact the number is more because in some

854
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,490
places that are not counties and some

855
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,290
places are subdivided under the counties

856
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:35,860
so the number is really closer to about

857
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:37,600
5,000 different political entities that

858
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,928
control elections in the country and

859
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,389
they have different capabilities some of

860
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,519
them are you know have a single IT

861
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,500
administrator for the entire county

862
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,580
who's worried about things like you know

863
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,929
property tax assessments as well as you

864
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,350
know maintaining the voter registration

865
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:59,590
lists in that County and protecting

866
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,389
those those information systems others

867
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,299
are going to be more sophisticated than

868
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:06,010
that so it's very highly variable fifty

869
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:07,809
different sets of rules for the

870
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:12,879
different states plus territories and

871
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:15,339
the District of Columbia and then you

872
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,949
have these all these individual offices

873
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,739
who are administering it on top of that

874
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:24,520
elections in the United States are the

875
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:27,098
most complex of any democracy on earth

876
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,399
we've that is to say we vote for more

877
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,770
things than on a particular ballot on

878
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,929
Election Day than just about anyone else

879
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,790
so our ballots tend to be longer here

880
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,369
we're in California you're but you know

881
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,230
you you know you notice that not only do

882
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,609
you vote for particular offices and

883
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,379
there are going to be a lot of those in

884
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,649
any elections but you also valid

885
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:51,098
initiatives and and bond issues and so

886
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:53,980
on so we may be you know asked to make

887
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:56,200
you know twenty or thirty decisions on a

888
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,970
ballot in the United States not merely

889
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,960
you know check off the box for who you

890
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:03,459
want to be your representatives and you

891
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,260
know in fact there may be different

892
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,270
ballots even within a polling place

893
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,160
depending on where someone lives things

894
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,000
like school board elections and so on

895
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,069
may have multiple different ballots

896
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,040
depending on the precise residence of

897
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,170
the particular voter so it's very very

898
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,869
logistical II complicated which is to

899
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:26,200
say that the answer we'll just don't use

900
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:30,880
computers at all is likely not to be a

901
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,618
practical solution computers have a role

902
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,690
to play here and the question is how do

903
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:38,440
we get the benefits of computing without

904
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,930
the risks of inheriting computing

905
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,599
here's a picture that the older members

906
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,870
of the audience may recognize does

907
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,880
anybody remember this

908
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:51,170
it was a while ago this is a picture of

909
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,770
the Florida recount in the 2000 election

910
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:59,790
and this is a one of the recount

911
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:02,520
officials examining a paper ballot and

912
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,009
us the source of our a lot of our

913
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,020
troubles can be traced to this

914
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,600
particular picture and it's interesting

915
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:14,810
because I think the picture this picture

916
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:19,410
has changed in meaning over the 18 years

917
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:22,320
since it was since it was taken almost

918
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,810
19 years now this picture originally

919
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,940
could be you know a captions look at

920
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,520
those idiots in Florida and their

921
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,120
primitive election technology we've

922
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,500
really gotta fix this and now I think

923
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,660
the caption that I would put on this

924
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,270
picture is look at the strength of this

925
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,629
voting system where a human being can

926
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,820
examine a ballot and learn more about

927
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,510
what the voters intent was isn't that an

928
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:51,270
amazing property of the system that we

929
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:54,420
have this human readable human recount

930
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,100
Abal thing and I think that lesson is

931
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,330
one that we really need to take away

932
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,450
from this so I'm gonna talk briefly

933
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,490
about the 2000 presidential election

934
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,649
this was a voting machine used in

935
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,689
Florida and other states this particular

936
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,220
one was from Wisconsin but this is the

937
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,250
same model machine that was used in

938
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,189
Florida in the 2000 election and it's

939
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,080
called a punch card voting machine and

940
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,970
the interesting thing about this machine

941
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,040
is that it does not have any electricity

942
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,930
involved except for the light in the

943
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,640
voting booth

944
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:30,000
but it has a memory leak in it and that

945
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:34,049
memory leak had a really interesting

946
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,080
property that it only appeared on very

947
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:39,270
popular elections so in particular the

948
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:43,350
way this machine works and I have one of

949
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:47,880
them right here so this is a stolen from

950
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:49,799
Wisconsin the what the voter does is

951
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,160
puts in a paper ballot and then takes

952
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:58,080
this little stylus and punches a hole

953
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,250
through where the position on the card

954
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,350
associated with there can

955
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,810
is takes the card out and puts the card

956
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,250
in the ultimate ballot box the problem

957
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,000
with that is the little pieces of

958
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:12,930
cardboard from the ballot these are

959
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,940
these are ballots that end up having to

960
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,440
go somewhere it punches a hole through

961
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,010
the ballot and because of conservation

962
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,840
of matter that cardboard ends up going

963
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,110
somewhere and where it goes is right

964
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:30,750
behind the position in the little

965
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:32,310
machine where the candidate was now for

966
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,700
most elections that doesn't really

967
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:38,160
matter but if four times as many people

968
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,410
show up as the machine is designed to be

969
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,910
able to handle what happens is that you

970
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:45,060
have a buildup of these pieces of

971
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:46,890
cardboard behind the positions

972
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,520
associated with the most popular

973
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:52,430
candidates so by the end of the day

974
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,990
candidates become harder to vote for

975
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,529
physically because it's harder to get

976
00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:00,990
the little stylists through the ballot

977
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,210
and what happens is that instead of a

978
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,729
nice hole as we see in the upper right

979
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:09,930
what you might end up with is just

980
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:13,290
dimple in the piece of cardboard where

981
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:16,710
that candidate is associated or you

982
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:19,320
might create a little slap where the

983
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,180
candidates position is the problem is

984
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,490
the way these ballots are read is

985
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,640
they're taken and put through an optical

986
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:28,979
reader that tests light through the

987
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,220
ballot and if that piece of cardboard

988
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,770
isn't is isn't is still obstructing the

989
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,600
position it won't register as a vote but

990
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,540
a human being can look at it and say oh

991
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,180
well they eyed too clearly in this

992
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,720
particular place but they only dimpled

993
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,339
it and a person can figure that out the

994
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,169
consequence was we didn't know for a

995
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,430
while who won the 2000 election it was a

996
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:55,680
big mess and it but it led to a piece of

997
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,680
remarkable bipartisanship in Congress

998
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,390
called the help America Vote Act and

999
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,980
that was hurriedly passed and it

1000
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,350
basically mandated that we get rid of

1001
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,840
this old embarrassing technology that

1002
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:10,110
didn't involve computers and replace it

1003
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,480
with accessible voting technology and

1004
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,170
basically the effect was it created a

1005
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,150
huge pile

1006
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,329
money for the states to buy new voting

1007
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,119
machines but those voting machines

1008
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:23,490
mostly didn't exist at the time the

1009
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,210
money for them was allocated and so the

1010
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:29,879
market rose to the occasion and very

1011
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,490
hurriedly produced computerized voting

1012
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,619
terminals for the states to buy to

1013
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:38,759
replace all of this old equipment and

1014
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:41,730
the most prominent of the hava compliant

1015
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,270
voting machines is called ad re machine

1016
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:49,829
not to be confused with the doctor of

1017
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:51,839
the same name but the but a direct

1018
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:54,780
recording electronic machine in other

1019
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,859
words a computer terminal that records

1020
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,920
your vote in its memory rather than on

1021
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:04,140
paper and this is an example of a D re

1022
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,030
voting machine this is made by a company

1023
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,299
called es ns it's called an aye vote

1024
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:11,640
Roenick lowercase I capital V it's not

1025
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:13,319
actually made by Apple in spite of that

1026
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,500
but it's basically a touchscreen

1027
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:19,558
computer that has an internal memory

1028
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,480
that stores the ballot and this is a

1029
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,130
typical example of such a machine it's

1030
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,140
one that we looked at in my lab at Penn

1031
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:29,490
on behalf of the state of Ohio in 2007

1032
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,140
the observation here is this is not a

1033
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,970
voting machine it's a computer that's

1034
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,440
running voting applications it's a

1035
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,819
specialized computer running software

1036
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:44,609
I'm just going to say one thing about

1037
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:46,829
software software is bad we don't really

1038
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,960
know how to write software but the

1039
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,740
correctness of software in this

1040
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,400
application is critically important why

1041
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:59,490
because it's recording the voters choice

1042
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,470
in memory controlled by the software

1043
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,479
that the voter is voting on so if that

1044
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,848
software has a flaw in it that causes

1045
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,640
the machine to miss record the vote

1046
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:11,130
there is no way to recover from that we

1047
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,470
don't have any way other than what the

1048
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,920
Machine is telling us to find out how

1049
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:21,180
somebody voted in that design software

1050
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,760
as many of us have discovered we don't

1051
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,680
have general techniques for determining

1052
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,690
whether general software is correct

1053
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,109
in fact we can kind of prove that we

1054
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,880
never will for general software we can't

1055
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:36,640
really test software under all

1056
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,710
circumstances and complexity is the

1057
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,180
enemy of correctness as we've discovered

1058
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,180
software and election systems is used

1059
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:49,149
all over the place it is before the

1060
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,098
election to define ballots it's used for

1061
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,519
provision voting machines it's used to

1062
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:57,490
register voters it's used on Election

1063
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,890
Day in voting machines and also in

1064
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:03,788
devices that may maintain the role of

1065
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:07,109
voters and it's used post election for

1066
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:10,960
tallying and result reporting and for

1067
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:15,400
auditing as well as for recounts now

1068
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,329
there are potential vulnerabilities

1069
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,529
across all sorts of places one yeah

1070
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,240
there's the possibility of tampering

1071
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:25,019
with results that are recorded in

1072
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,368
machines tampering with results that are

1073
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,348
reported to the County headquarters

1074
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,269
tampering with the software that

1075
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:33,069
actually records the VOSA votes in the

1076
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:36,910
first place tampering with the software

1077
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:40,000
that is counting the ballots and

1078
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,589
reporting out the final tallies and so

1079
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,269
on and then we've got the question of

1080
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:46,058
how do we audit the software to ensure

1081
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:48,430
that the software that we think is

1082
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,170
running is the actual software that's

1083
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,299
running let alone the question of

1084
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,430
whether that software is correct so I'm

1085
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:57,849
gonna make a humble observation which is

1086
00:43:54,430 --> 00:44:00,879
that cryptography doesn't help with most

1087
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:05,109
of these problems in particular it

1088
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,720
doesn't help with solving these problems

1089
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,339
in ways that allow us to recover from

1090
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,509
errors in good ways

1091
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:15,940
so there are some safeguards and to make

1092
00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:18,509
sure that these machines are in fact

1093
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,940
working well the most important is

1094
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:23,710
called government certification of the

1095
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,559
vendors and of the equipment the

1096
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:29,380
machines need to be certified as being

1097
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,220
correct anyone who knows how to certify

1098
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:35,680
software as being correct is welcome to

1099
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:38,169
step up and do that I don't know how to

1100
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,410
do that but these machines do have to be

1101
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,000
certified to

1102
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,859
to do this and there are some other

1103
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,990
mechanisms that I won't talk about in

1104
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:47,180
great detail except to say that there

1105
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:50,709
are really four major vendors in the

1106
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:54,440
United States of voting equipment and

1107
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:56,180
all of them have had serious questions

1108
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,710
raised about the security and integrity

1109
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:01,160
of the systems that they actually

1110
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,579
produce so how secure is computerized

1111
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,799
voting well as a Yogi Berra and later

1112
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:09,470
John von Neumann are reputed to have

1113
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:12,410
said in theory theory and practice are

1114
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:14,720
the same in practice they're different

1115
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,819
so Evo ting in theory should be a matter

1116
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,859
of basically there should be a line in

1117
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:20,359
the software somewhere when you cast a

1118
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,400
vote for a candidate that says you know

1119
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:24,740
votes or this candidate equals votes for

1120
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,900
this candidate plus one and if that line

1121
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,509
is there then the system is correct and

1122
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,890
if it's not then it's not correct and

1123
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,630
theoretically it should be just a

1124
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:38,480
question of grep you know for that line

1125
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:40,700
in practice there's a lot there a lot of

1126
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,190
moving parts here county election

1127
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,439
management software voting machine

1128
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,319
software and firmware the communications

1129
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,049
in the system and so on and there and

1130
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,359
the huge temporary workforce of people

1131
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:56,029
who have access to this the logistics of

1132
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,250
a lot of elections are are amazing

1133
00:45:56,029 --> 00:46:00,529
there's some potential attacks and the

1134
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,329
first one I'm going to list is the one

1135
00:46:00,529 --> 00:46:05,270
that the state actor might be interested

1136
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:07,309
in which is denial of service and you

1137
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,410
know how do you prevent the vote from

1138
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:11,480
actually taking place well we kind of

1139
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,759
don't know how to do that I'll give you

1140
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,819
an example of the system a system we

1141
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,180
were given access to at Penn in 2007 the

1142
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:23,119
group that I led was a system made by es

1143
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:26,808
& s it's the largest vendor it had

1144
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,000
penetration in 43 states it had never

1145
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:30,410
been actually independently looked at

1146
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,900
outside of the certification process

1147
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:35,029
before a quick summary of what we found

1148
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:39,470
was that we could compromise every

1149
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:42,279
component of the ESS system a in every

1150
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:45,410
at every stage of the election process

1151
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:48,339
and we could do this in ways with no

1152
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:52,020
more access than a voter in some cases

1153
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:53,490
voting or a precinct poll worker Oh

1154
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,860
basically if you can touch it or get

1155
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:58,200
near it you can compromise it and this

1156
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:02,119
is a typical outcome when independent

1157
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:05,129
people are able to look at these systems

1158
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,600
you know the various independent reviews

1159
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:11,490
that have taken place of these systems

1160
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:14,460
have found just a crisis of practical

1161
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:17,850
security vulnerabilities pretty much

1162
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,200
every e-voting system that has reached

1163
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,529
the market has had serious

1164
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,589
vulnerabilities found in it and they're

1165
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:28,230
all below the standards that we would

1166
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:31,110
normally associate with high quality

1167
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,490
critical systems so it's tempting to

1168
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:35,550
look at that and say well let's just

1169
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:38,609
find ways to build better software but

1170
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:41,730
in fact the ultimate problems are

1171
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:43,260
architectural so what should we do well

1172
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,820
in the short term the first thing is you

1173
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,570
can't just say well let's not hold

1174
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:50,490
elections until we fix this and you know

1175
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:53,280
as engineers we might say we're not

1176
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:55,830
ready to ship but you know that we don't

1177
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,869
have a choice there are constitutional

1178
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,000
reasons that we have elections on

1179
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:02,580
particular days and while we still have

1180
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,330
a constitution let's enjoy it

1181
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:09,660
so in the shorter term you know we kind

1182
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,460
of need better audits more procedural

1183
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,529
controls be aware of what the

1184
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,290
vulnerabilities are in the longer term

1185
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,000
we need better architectural models that

1186
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:21,779
don't make us as dependent on

1187
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,050
fundamentally insecure things and the

1188
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:28,160
two components of this that have emerged

1189
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:31,380
as the state of the art our first

1190
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,109
concept first introduced by Ron Rivest

1191
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,210
called software independence and

1192
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:38,670
software independence is the property

1193
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:43,800
that says the outcome of the election

1194
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:45,660
should not be dependent on software

1195
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,700
itself that is if there's a flaw in the

1196
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,950
software you can still find out who won

1197
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,720
the election I'm paraphrasing something

1198
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,000
so build systems that don't have

1199
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,029
software as a critical component that's

1200
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,109
a pretty bold requirement but in fact

1201
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:03,390
it's achievable in with technology that

1202
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:05,700
actually exists today off-the-shelf and

1203
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,600
the second is a concept called risk

1204
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:13,410
limiting audits which is a way of

1205
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:17,370
sampling statistically sampling voting

1206
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:19,379
machines by doing a manual recount of

1207
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:21,150
their results and comparing it with the

1208
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,820
reported results in a significant

1209
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,800
statistically significant way that will

1210
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,870
give you confidence that if the software

1211
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,450
worked on your randomly selected sample

1212
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,890
after the election that it hadn't that

1213
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,230
it was working well in the other places

1214
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:36,089
and you can achieve a very high level of

1215
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:38,340
confidence and this can help you achieve

1216
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,650
the software independence property and

1217
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:43,770
practice with things like optical scan

1218
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:45,780
paper ballots which exists today and

1219
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:48,990
they can be bought and in fact many

1220
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,520
states are switching over and using them

1221
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,109
so let me just get to the thing

1222
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,070
everybody's going to say which is but

1223
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:59,160
what about the blockchain and the

1224
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:01,860
blockchain sounds perfect all right it's

1225
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,390
a decentralized and mutable ledger bla

1226
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,880
bla bla and isn't that what elections

1227
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:08,460
are and we want to get consensus

1228
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,410
mechanisms and so on but first of all

1229
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,000
it's worth noting that even though

1230
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:15,629
elections are about finding out what the

1231
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,100
consensus is the components of an actual

1232
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:21,620
conduct of an election legally are

1233
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:24,150
hierarchical right so we have a

1234
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:26,400
designated set of election officials who

1235
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,050
certify the results we don't just all

1236
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,610
kind of get together and say well we

1237
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,850
kind of agree on who won the election

1238
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:35,280
we're really trusting mechanisms and

1239
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:37,110
officials to conduct elections and

1240
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,160
report the outcomes in ways that we can

1241
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:44,400
audit but it's ultimately not a

1242
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,230
decentralized consensus application it's

1243
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,290
telling us what the consensus is but

1244
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:51,740
it's not but the mechanism itself is

1245
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:54,480
defined by a hierarchy that ultimately

1246
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,520
traces back to the US Constitution so

1247
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,020
any solution that says just changed the

1248
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,759
Constitution about how we think about

1249
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,890
elections is already kind of a

1250
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,070
non-starter the second problem is that

1251
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:08,759
it's heavily dependent on software

1252
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:12,000
integrity in particular the question not

1253
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,040
of what is on the blockchain but is

1254
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,350
what's on the blockchain actually what

1255
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,509
people voted for which is what the

1256
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:21,720
problem that we currently have look

1257
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:24,240
like so it doesn't actually solve the

1258
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,149
problem that current systems have which

1259
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,910
is that the software used to cast votes

1260
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:33,660
may be wrong it also have serious issues

1261
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:36,089
of ballot secrecy and it addresses about

1262
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,190
it really addresses tamper detection not

1263
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:41,970
recovery what do you do if the

1264
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:43,740
blockchain doesn't actually tell you the

1265
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,779
right answer do you throw out some of

1266
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,580
the votes you do over the election well

1267
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,500
we're back to the original problem so

1268
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,299
everyone just stop with the blockchain

1269
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,520
stuff already okay

1270
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:58,500
so for further reading when we recommend

1271
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,970
two things first of all the national

1272
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,850
academy of science engineering and

1273
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:05,459
medicine just issued a consensus report

1274
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:08,160
list here on securing the vote it is the

1275
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:12,360
single best resource on the technical

1276
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:15,930
problems in voting that I know of and

1277
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,310
the second recommendation is if you want

1278
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:20,000
to get involved with this where do you

1279
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:23,190
start start by learning what the

1280
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,560
problems are the best way I know of to

1281
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:29,010
do that volunteer to be a poll worker

1282
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,540
with your local county officials sign up

1283
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,570
to be a poll worker they need the help

1284
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:35,460
you'll work really hard for a day you'll

1285
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,500
learn an awful lot about the

1286
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,300
nitty-gritty of how elections are done

1287
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,040
it is a absolutely great experience and

1288
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,990
you get to give out those little I voted

1289
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,360
stickers to your neighbors which are

1290
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,979
heavily coveted so thanks very much and

1291
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,860
I think that we have time for any

1292
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,139
questions

1293
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,139
[Applause]

1294
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,400
yeah we have plenty of time for some

1295
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,808
questions and sure you'll definitely

1296
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:06,200
first so one spooky outcome of this is

1297
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:08,599
potentially that you create an incentive

1298
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,868
for the voting companies to say okay we

1299
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:14,720
did it wrong by our V 2.0 it's better

1300
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:17,900
it's more complicated how do you can't

1301
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,899
how do you counteract that with this

1302
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,150
kind of a Tara you know kind of harder

1303
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,250
to comprehend you know it new is not

1304
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,039
necessarily better you know how do you

1305
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:30,710
deal with that messaging asymmetry yeah

1306
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,380
so it's really tough and real one of the

1307
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,450
parts of that problem is that we conduct

1308
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:39,309
elections every year we conduct national

1309
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:41,868
elections you know every four years and

1310
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:44,720
elections for national office every two

1311
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:46,670
years and you know we we have to do them

1312
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,500
and we also have primary elections so

1313
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,539
there's a fundamental practical problem

1314
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:54,410
that there's a next election coming up

1315
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:57,190
and we have to conduct it and you know

1316
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:59,779
no solution that doesn't involve

1317
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,660
addressing that part of the problem is

1318
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:05,450
viable now fortunately we're in a in a

1319
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,490
in a really unique situation in time and

1320
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,769
I'm optimistic actually for the first

1321
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,180
time since I've been working on this or

1322
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:14,990
more optimistic or less pessimistic

1323
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:18,259
let's say you left us a mystery the the

1324
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:21,319
the first thing is there is bipartisan I

1325
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:22,930
won't say consensus but recognition that

1326
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:25,279
this is an issue that's worth solving

1327
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:28,490
and there's agreement that we should

1328
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:30,799
have systems of high integrity and it

1329
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,899
that had this has previously been much

1330
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:34,490
more partisan than it is now I mean you

1331
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,170
know notwithstanding anything about the

1332
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:39,288
last election Russian interference and

1333
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:41,930
so on you will find prominent members of

1334
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:43,309
Congress for example saying the same

1335
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:47,058
things from both sides of the aisle

1336
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:49,130
about the need to do this the second is

1337
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:52,069
that the equipment purchased under the

1338
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:55,849
help America Vote Act is now starting to

1339
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:59,538
reach the end of its natural life cycle

1340
00:54:55,849 --> 00:55:03,710
and so the opportunity to get new stuff

1341
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:05,509
is actually increasingly there so we

1342
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,870
have both political will and a kind of

1343
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:08,850
natural opportunity to

1344
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:12,330
replacing the technology that we have

1345
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:13,650
the technology to do you know risk

1346
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,290
limiting audits in a software

1347
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,000
independent way exists optical scan

1348
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,970
paper ballots plus the risk limiting

1349
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,710
audits we can do this and so you know

1350
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,660
get involved at a local level encourage

1351
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,670
your local county officials to want this

1352
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,980
encourage your secretary of state to

1353
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:31,590
want it that's probably the best way

1354
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,560
forward here great thank you very much

1355
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:37,440
okay over there hello

1356
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,980
so I've heard an argument that the mass

1357
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,170
that's described of the five thousand

1358
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,490
legislative units or administrative

1359
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,770
units doing it in all the different ways

1360
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,299
of doing it is the best defense for it

1361
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,690
it's just so hard to subvert because

1362
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,130
it's such a mess and that any attempt to

1363
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,080
make it more efficient and Harold Lee

1364
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,850
makes it more subvert able and we

1365
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,140
shouldn't even try yeah do you buy that

1366
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:01,770
argument yeah and and it's interesting

1367
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:03,990
because that's true probably if you're

1368
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,550
interested in completely changing the

1369
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,859
outcome of all the votes in the country

1370
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:09,690
that's a strength but that's not

1371
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,360
actually the problem someone trying to

1372
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,950
subvert an election has first of all

1373
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,890
most of the actual measure of intensity

1374
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:19,290
about local offices and if you are a

1375
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,390
national level adversary you know some

1376
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:24,900
country you know rhyming with Usha

1377
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:26,509
or whatever you are you have an

1378
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:29,820
interesting job because now you have

1379
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:31,950
5000 targets and all you need to do is

1380
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:36,600
really picked enough of the weakest of

1381
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:38,279
them to cause confidence to go away so

1382
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,560
you're not going to necessarily pick the

1383
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,950
hardest you're gonna pick the weakest

1384
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:47,190
and there's a certain amount of

1385
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:48,540
homogeneity in these systems because you

1386
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:53,880
know they're using only a few different

1387
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:56,759
vendors and so it's certainly you know

1388
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,700
plausible that a national adversary

1389
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,520
could cause widespread disruption and I

1390
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:05,640
think the only reason that this hasn't

1391
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,450
happened if if it hasn't happened is for

1392
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,069
lack of trying rather than any inherent

1393
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:13,169
rocky be just go time for one quick

1394
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:16,110
questions make it very quick I think I

1395
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:17,850
can be quick Matt you alluded to state

1396
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,230
actors and you said one state actor or

1397
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,650
you implied there's one state actor but

1398
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:21,600
isn't this

1399
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:25,620
over the last 50 years the largest

1400
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:27,600
interferer in well maybe through but you

1401
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,370
know probably not of us elections you

1402
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,620
know when notwithstanding the Watergate

1403
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,810
break-in right you know where there were

1404
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:38,130
CIA operatives doing this say you know

1405
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:40,049
if we assume that you know it's state

1406
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,660
actors that we're going again even if

1407
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:44,850
you believe that the CIA is secretly

1408
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,890
trying to pick the president nothing I

1409
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,830
said changes right we still want

1410
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:52,290
mechanisms that are software independent

1411
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:54,450
that are hard to attack that allow us to

1412
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:56,880
get confidence without depending on

1413
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:58,850
complex software and so on and so yes

1414
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,260
I'm asking for ways that we can avoid

1415
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:03,600
compromising democracy worldwide rather

1416
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:14,010
than just yeah that is not in the scope

1417
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:16,259
of my talk okay and with that call to

1418
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:18,000
arms for next year we end a session

1419
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,460
please thank everybody from the session

1420
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,440
please before you all go don't get up

1421
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,540
because it's really the most important

1422
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:33,060
part of the conference is now turn it up

1423
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:34,890
and I'm going to hand over to Dan yeah

1424
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,100
all right Thank You Nigel great way to

1425
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:40,520
start the morning let me just get set up

1426
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,520
here

1427
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,940
yeah that's not what I had in mind

1428
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,869
[Music]

1429
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,809
boy okay

1430
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:23,640
yeah just blink at 60 Hertz and we'll be

1431
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:23,640
fine we'll get there

1432
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:40,100
does anybody have another dongle that's

1433
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:56,569
that seems to be the problem use BCE to

1434
01:00:40,100 --> 01:01:08,720
HDMI thank you thank you plug in your

1435
01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:10,340
hardware into my machine please all

1436
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,799
right so we can make the ecology work

1437
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:16,370
even in 21st century although not for

1438
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,590
voting great okay well so after this

1439
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,120
wonderful morning session this is

1440
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,640
actually one of the fun parts of the

1441
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,040
conference where we get to award the

1442
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,470
Levchin prize four-wheeled world crypto

1443
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,450
so just to remind you the Levchin prize

1444
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:32,270
is awarded once a year at this

1445
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:34,370
conference it's actually it's a prize it

1446
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:36,590
honors major innovations in real world

1447
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,210
cryptography basically innovations that

1448
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:40,940
have the significant impact on the use

1449
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:43,520
of cryptography in the real world yeah

1450
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,310
it's a lot of fun to do and the

1451
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,090
selection selection of winners is is

1452
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:51,770
always a fantastic task ok so I should

1453
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,200
say the website for this award is left

1454
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,940
in prize calm and I'll I guess I should

1455
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,680
mention this throughout the the the

1456
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,810
session that we're always looking for

1457
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,549
nominations for more winners so please

1458
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,250
go to this site there's a nomination

1459
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:06,980
form and nominate your you know your

1460
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,570
friends and and people you admire who

1461
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:12,050
you think should win an award like this

1462
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:14,120
so the prize itself started in 2016 it's

1463
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:15,940
named after Max Levchin we probably know

1464
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,710
Max Levchin is the founder of PayPal

1465
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,410
he's been an enormous supporter and

1466
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:24,380
champion of cryptography for many many

1467
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:25,430
years over 20 years I guess in 2015 or

1468
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,010
so we could have approached him about

1469
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:30,140
creating this prize and he without even

1470
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:33,950
blinking said yes I'll do it right away

1471
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:36,920
and so we said we want to offer we want

1472
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:39,350
to you know give out two awards a year

1473
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,410
each award comes with a $10,000 prize

1474
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,210
and max

1475
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:44,549
has actually agreed to fund this prize

1476
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:47,820
in perpetuity so forever so the surprise

1477
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:49,050
will go on for many many years as long

1478
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:53,550
as there's a need for wheel roll

1479
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:55,380
cryptography okay so that's the price so

1480
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,910
we've had a number of winners so far

1481
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,770
it's actually by the way it's quite a

1482
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,540
commitment from Maxis part so we're

1483
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:02,910
really grateful for everything he's done

1484
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,480
and you know it's wonderful that we can

1485
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,730
make this happen

1486
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,440
okay so we've had a number of winners so

1487
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:11,880
far so the first winners were Phil

1488
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,710
Rockaway and the mighty LS team then the

1489
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,330
main and Moxie and Trevor Perrin for a

1490
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,400
signal and of course the development of

1491
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:19,500
AES and other cryptographic primitives

1492
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,500
last year who go krafchick

1493
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:25,890
won the award and the OpenSSL team won

1494
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:29,190
the award for the remarkable work on you

1495
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:31,950
know bringing making ssl as MPLS as a

1496
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:34,440
widely deployed as it is and so with

1497
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:37,230
that we are ready to announce the

1498
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,740
winners of the 2019 live Chan prize

1499
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:43,200
winner

1500
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:44,819
okay so drumroll thank you okay so there

1501
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,359
are two winners there are two winners

1502
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:52,650
the first winner of the 2019 Lochan

1503
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:57,050
prize ah okay here we go

1504
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,050
okay is I mean here Volare

1505
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:07,689
[Music]

1506
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,390
yeah yeah

1507
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:14,480
[Applause]

1508
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:14,480
[Music]

1509
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:26,930
[Music]

1510
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:29,450
your time okay yes okay awesome

1511
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:32,210
all right so me here is a giant in our

1512
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,770
field I'm sure you all know me here it

1513
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,360
was actually kind of hard to distill all

1514
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,220
of his contributions into a single

1515
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,790
sentence that we can put on the trophy

1516
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:42,109
but the award is essentially off

1517
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:44,150
provided for outstanding contributions

1518
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,170
to the design and analysis of real-world

1519
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,880
cryptosystems

1520
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,700
including the development of the random

1521
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,280
Oracle model modes of operation H Mac

1522
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:54,319
and models for key exchange and this is

1523
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,300
really only a tiny tiny sliver of

1524
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,950
everything that we here has done for

1525
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,540
four-wheel rod cryptography so it's

1526
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:02,120
really a pleasure being here to be able

1527
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:03,440
to offer this award to you and I should

1528
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,500
say the award comes with this beautiful

1529
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,380
trophy it's a cryptex so it's actually

1530
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:11,360
this bit so the the citation is here on

1531
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:13,130
the bottom and then you can kind of

1532
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,720
figure out the it's your challenge to

1533
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:17,210
figure out what the secret password is

1534
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,089
and open up the cryptex and find what's

1535
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:24,340
inside so let me give you first of all

1536
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:27,650
the award yeah so this is the first part

1537
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:30,770
this is a second part so that's the

1538
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,450
cryptex and then most importantly I have

1539
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:35,470
to not forget to actually give you the

1540
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:38,450
actual check so yeah

1541
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:43,830
[Applause]

1542
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:45,270
congratulations and traditionally the

1543
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:47,009
award winners actually may get to make a

1544
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:48,540
speech tell the community kind of put

1545
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,880
the award in context tell the community

1546
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:54,029
where they see the field going so the

1547
01:05:50,880 --> 01:06:04,260
stage is yours me here do you really

1548
01:05:54,030 --> 01:06:06,000
want to plug things in okay I have no

1549
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,880
training as a cryptanalysts I'll have

1550
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,310
trouble with that breaking that thing

1551
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,800
it's an honor to be recognized but

1552
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:15,930
particularly by RWC and Max Levchin

1553
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,240
and thanks to max in the steering

1554
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,100
committee for this and thanks also to

1555
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,560
great co-authors over the years

1556
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:24,360
particularly Phil of course and also to

1557
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,070
the great students and postdocs they're

1558
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,530
the ones who made everything possible

1559
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:30,960
I'm glad to have been part of the

1560
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,700
exciting early journey in bridging the

1561
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,890
gap between theory and real world

1562
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,379
cryptography those were different times

1563
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,720
a smaller community the sense of doing

1564
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:42,030
something important now it feels awkward

1565
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:45,299
to get an award for things done so long

1566
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:48,300
ago and that leads me to ask what time

1567
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,800
has done and what I find with time is

1568
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,380
that I'm thinking more and more about

1569
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:55,020
broader issues in life where our work

1570
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:58,020
fits into the social fabric how we

1571
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:00,690
evolve as people in communities what is

1572
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:02,400
the right definition of success and so

1573
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,570
kind of returning to my roots in the

1574
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,980
humanities I spend more time reading

1575
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:09,990
sociology and philosophy and listening

1576
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,120
and trying to understand how the world

1577
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,770
in our minds work and I spend

1578
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,150
correspondingly less and less time on

1579
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,690
cryptography for which I have to

1580
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:20,190
apologize to my students and as part of

1581
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,830
this has been an evolution in my

1582
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:25,470
thinking of what real world or practical

1583
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:28,110
means and I think we benefit from asking

1584
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:29,879
this question more and more when I

1585
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:32,070
started it was a question of being

1586
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,230
responsive to industry and implementer

1587
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:38,250
needs to address what they call

1588
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:41,700
practical problems and what people were

1589
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:43,140
looking at and wanting to solve and now

1590
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,210
I think that there are these are much

1591
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,330
deeper questions like one needs to ask

1592
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:51,090
whose needs one is addressing exactly

1593
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:52,160
and in short who benefits from the work

1594
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:54,349
we do and this is

1595
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,480
more complex but it's important because

1596
01:07:54,349 --> 01:07:59,809
we live in a world that's fractured and

1597
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,809
iniquitous and how much of what we do

1598
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:05,839
helps rich corporations get richer does

1599
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:08,240
it increase or decrease in equity who

1600
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,480
benefits from making things faster our

1601
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:14,029
beyond a certain point the constant

1602
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,710
search for speed what sort of people do

1603
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:17,839
we become when we cannot wait half a

1604
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:20,420
second for a web page to load because

1605
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,939
TLS is doing a round trip and we cut

1606
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:24,440
corners is it a good or bad thing if

1607
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:27,528
Facebook gets faster

1608
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:30,799
I guess my worry is that these goals are

1609
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:33,620
driven more by some entities financial

1610
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:36,620
concerns then having value to our

1611
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:41,028
development as people and I've come to

1612
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:43,969
feel over time that what one does in

1613
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:46,929
helping others is in the end the

1614
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:49,069
greatest reward even for oneself and

1615
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:51,620
excitement and ambition that one can

1616
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:54,199
have in an area can die with time and

1617
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:56,660
have seen that happen unless underlined

1618
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:59,448
by some greater sense of purpose and

1619
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:01,849
connection and that's what I feel RWC is

1620
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:04,399
important but that's the community which

1621
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:06,770
has come together with a broader more

1622
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:09,410
holistic sense of what science and

1623
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:10,640
cryptography are about and is really

1624
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:13,540
trying to make the world a better place

1625
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:17,029
and there are many ways to contribute

1626
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:19,698
despite my real-world sympathies I feel

1627
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:21,620
I'm still at hearted theoretician and I

1628
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:24,229
feel sometimes the most important thing

1629
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,509
we can give to others is ideas and that

1630
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:29,660
beauty and depth of social value just

1631
01:09:26,509 --> 01:09:31,310
like art and inspire people and that has

1632
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,130
been a tradition in cryptography that I

1633
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:36,230
hope continues I feel like I'm turning

1634
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:40,100
into a rambling old man up here kind of

1635
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:41,959
embarrassed to bring that to you but if

1636
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:44,299
I feel with time I have all questions

1637
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:48,080
and clarity and at least I can take

1638
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:50,960
refuge in Shakespeare's adage that above

1639
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,250
all to thine own self be true and

1640
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,480
luckily they don't give me more than

1641
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,480
five minutes to speak to you

1642
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:15,129
[Music]

1643
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,929
thank you

1644
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,210
this is uh quite thought-provoking

1645
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:23,369
whether cryptography can help to make

1646
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:26,460
the world a better place in other areas

1647
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:28,259
and just protecting information all

1648
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,639
right fantastic so with that as I said

1649
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:33,330
there are always every year there are

1650
01:10:29,639 --> 01:10:36,300
two winners and so the second winner

1651
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:38,550
this year I have to say was quite an

1652
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:42,900
easy decision it was kind of an obvious

1653
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:44,610
choice to make and so the second winner

1654
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,619
of the Levchin prize for realreal

1655
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:52,159
cryptography drumroll please

1656
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:52,159
that's this thank you is Erik briscola

1657
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:58,570
[Music]

1658
01:10:54,130 --> 01:11:02,420
[Applause]

1659
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:02,420
[Music]

1660
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,840
[Music]

1661
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:15,400
all right great so Eric as you all know

1662
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,850
is behind the standardization efforts in

1663
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:21,940
T of TLS for many years and of course

1664
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:23,890
this year thanks to the TLS 1.3 effort

1665
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:26,049
we finally have we have a fantastic

1666
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:28,030
protocol to this to deploy so let me

1667
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:29,860
read the citations so this is for stage

1668
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,690
sustained contributions to the

1669
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,519
standardization of security protocols

1670
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:36,219
and most recently the development and

1671
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,410
standardization of TLS 1.3 so thank you

1672
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,930
Eric for all the work you've been doing

1673
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:43,090
we are extremely in your debt and I'm

1674
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:45,310
really happy that we can give you an

1675
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,780
award for all this work so here is your

1676
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:48,970
wonderful cryptex we'll see if you can

1677
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:51,099
figure out the secret word to open it

1678
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:58,420
and of course don't forget the award

1679
01:11:51,100 --> 01:12:02,340
prize okay hand over the mic I'm just

1680
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:02,340
glad the cheque isn't it in the cryptex

1681
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:14,140
thank you thanks Dan and thanks max and

1682
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,760
the committee it's really an honor to be

1683
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,380
here on being the company of the

1684
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,640
previous winners who I think have done a

1685
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,290
fantastic work

1686
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,110
I also want to thank the Tillis working

1687
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:24,280
group I really did move this work on the

1688
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:27,099
security research community he was like

1689
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,309
me to actually not suck and Mozilla for

1690
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,540
funding the work the one I was doing it

1691
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,890
the past decade has seen a remarkable

1692
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:34,330
increase in the use of encryption on the

1693
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,130
Internet and this is driven in to a

1694
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:37,570
great extent by the development of open

1695
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:39,700
or operable communication security

1696
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,780
protocols this allow anybody to build

1697
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,090
their own implementation they can talk

1698
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:44,349
to anybody else's standards are a key

1699
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,450
element in making that possible

1700
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:48,310
first they allow us to converge on

1701
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:50,260
common protocols so that that actually

1702
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:53,560
works they also coordinate the needs of

1703
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:55,120
multiple stakeholders who have interests

1704
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,370
and needs that are too hard for any one

1705
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,570
person to comprehend and finally they

1706
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,010
helped us build something better than

1707
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:01,620
any single person could have designed on

1708
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,760
their own no matter how smart they were

1709
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:06,099
one three is a great example of this

1710
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,020
when we started the one three effort we

1711
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,910
had about 20 years of experience with

1712
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:11,650
TLS implementations of deployments there

1713
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,210
were dozens of papers analyzed in TLS

1714
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:15,160
and we were also able to borrow from

1715
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:18,300
other protocols like quick rapido so you

1716
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:20,579
might have thought dot release easy

1717
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,320
not true so as soon as we started

1718
01:13:20,579 --> 01:13:23,429
actually doing anything we discovered it

1719
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,989
was just really hard to meet the goals

1720
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:26,639
we were trying to set we found we had

1721
01:13:24,989 --> 01:13:29,188
problems with the anti repo mechanism is

1722
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:30,510
er TT we struggled to add key separation

1723
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:31,650
because the analyst told us it was

1724
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,300
really important to be able to do

1725
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,789
analysis the protocol which had been so

1726
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:37,380
hard in 1.2 and finally when we actually

1727
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:38,518
when it did deployment we found that

1728
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,019
there were a lot of middle boxes which

1729
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:42,209
just broke very badly when we tried to

1730
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:43,079
1.3 through them and took us almost a

1731
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,239
year to get to the point where that

1732
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:47,188
worked properly

1733
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:49,379
the final protocol had contributions

1734
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:50,699
from over 80 people from the standards

1735
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,869
community from implantation community

1736
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:54,268
from deployment community and from the

1737
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:57,900
research community and I have a list

1738
01:13:54,269 --> 01:13:59,429
here so this is everybody in the

1739
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,820
knowledge mix of 1.3 if you're on this

1740
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:01,409
list

1741
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:12,209
give yourself a round of applause I see

1742
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:13,829
another people here you also it turns

1743
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:15,360
out how the right to a t-shirt if you

1744
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:19,259
haven't gotten one thing that TLS chairs

1745
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:21,659
ask them one thing that made this

1746
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:23,400
possible was this critical feedback loop

1747
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:24,478
between the standards community the

1748
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,789
implementation community and the

1749
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,059
research community so this let us try

1750
01:14:26,789 --> 01:14:31,139
out candidate designs quickly on

1751
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:32,249
evaluate them for deployment evaluate

1752
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:33,869
them for security and then roll them

1753
01:14:32,249 --> 01:14:36,090
into the protocol or not roll them in as

1754
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:37,978
the case may be when I go back and look

1755
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,389
at mail my mailbox from the period when

1756
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:40,709
we were doing the development it's full

1757
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:42,570
of emails to people like you go to

1758
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:44,159
kochak and Karthik bhargavan saying

1759
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:46,409
things like listen could you just take a

1760
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:47,518
really quick look at this or maybe you

1761
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:48,030
could run this through Provera for that

1762
01:14:47,519 --> 01:14:50,340
be ok

1763
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:52,349
and people were credibly generous for

1764
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,789
their time in doing that and being able

1765
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:55,050
to ask those kinds of questions gave us

1766
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:56,400
the confidence to make big changes the

1767
01:14:55,050 --> 01:15:00,599
protocol rather than just to run the

1768
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,768
edges as we had previously increasingly

1769
01:15:00,599 --> 01:15:03,119
there's a consensus in the internet

1770
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:05,070
community that in the words the Mozilla

1771
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,688
manifesto security and privacy in the

1772
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:08,159
internet are fundamental and encrypting

1773
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:10,579
everything all the time is the only way

1774
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,138
to really protect those needs

1775
01:15:10,579 --> 01:15:14,308
fortunately many of the companies that

1776
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:15,659
control so much of the traffic on the

1777
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,189
Internet are also committed this vision

1778
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:20,098
and I want to give you two examples of

1779
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:22,679
that first in 2014 let's encrypt was

1780
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:25,469
founded by Akamai Cisco EF EFT

1781
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:27,030
University Michigan is a law to provide

1782
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:29,939
certificates for basically everybody the

1783
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:32,309
internet for free in the time since then

1784
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:34,560
it now has 50 sponsors or

1785
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:35,580
it's the biggest sia internet and it's

1786
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,050
issuing about a million certificates

1787
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,630
today and this is what we can do when we

1788
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:41,880
like all work together we're also seeing

1789
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,990
companies moving rapidly to deploy new

1790
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,850
protocols they're secure by default

1791
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:46,530
they're doing this both book is better

1792
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:48,660
for the users and because we've learned

1793
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:50,309
the security performance as we thought

1794
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:52,380
in the past don't have to be enemies you

1795
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:55,170
can work together a few examples this

1796
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:58,140
HTTP to the new version of HTTP is only

1797
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:59,790
run over TLS essentially I'm tillis 1.30

1798
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,080
roundtrip lets us send data and

1799
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:02,880
essentially the same time as you would

1800
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,650
have sent with ordinary unencrypted TCP

1801
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,690
and finally the new quick protocols

1802
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:08,280
under development not only a is faster

1803
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,690
but B almost everybody in the wire

1804
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,480
including all the metadata is encrypted

1805
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,290
to the course tent we can make it happen

1806
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:15,030
so hopefully we're gonna get all this

1807
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:17,100
new tech and people always ask like

1808
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:19,380
doesn't this take forever like when is

1809
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,630
it actually gonna encrypt everything as

1810
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,340
a reference point five years after tales

1811
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:25,830
120 was deployed back in 2013

1812
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,810
um we were just starting to add it to

1813
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:29,820
Chrome and Firefox and about 11% of

1814
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:31,500
servers supported it we're about five

1815
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:33,210
months out of the standardization at one

1816
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,380
point three it's already been in Chrome

1817
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,420
or Firefox for quite some time

1818
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:38,970
I hear it's coming other browsers soon

1819
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,890
it's in about 10% of servers and I'm

1820
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,800
told that over half of Facebook traffic

1821
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:45,840
is already 1/3 this actually understates

1822
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,670
how fast things can move when we try we

1823
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,650
had es 130 test versions in the field

1824
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,330
over a year before we actually published

1825
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:53,009
the RFC this is how we found the middle

1826
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:54,390
box problem but full credit by the way

1827
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:57,270
to the team of Google really did all of

1828
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:58,620
the work here and the same thing is

1829
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:00,270
trying to happen without protocols like

1830
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,470
quick on MLS where we just start rolling

1831
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:03,300
our very early versions

1832
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:04,830
what makes this possible is a

1833
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,660
combination of better collaboration and

1834
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,580
better design in terms of collaboration

1835
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:10,260
protocol development uppers are starting

1836
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:12,030
to be run like open-source projects they

1837
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,770
have github repositories they have slack

1838
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,969
channels with ADA coordination and what

1839
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,620
this means is that we can roll out

1840
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,640
versions very quickly and then when we

1841
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,019
have to improve them we just keep

1842
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,250
rolling that new versions and the

1843
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,070
transition of the final version is

1844
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,910
generally quite easy at least we hope

1845
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:25,740
second the protocols are being designed

1846
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:27,570
to enable that kind of version rolling

1847
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,740
and that kind of extensibility and we're

1848
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:30,299
getting much better at it so it's much

1849
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:33,269
easier to have incremental new version

1850
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,320
of rollout finally having verification

1851
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,850
to feedback from the research community

1852
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,410
because the confidence to make those

1853
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:39,120
changes in deployed cryptography at

1854
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:41,480
scale rather than waiting forever before

1855
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,480
we do it

1856
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:47,530
um this next slide for my second slide

1857
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,840
is actual data from firefox telemetry

1858
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:52,239
and shows the rate at which web pages

1859
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,699
are loaded or HTTPS so if you go back

1860
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:56,620
for years we're looking at basically 35

1861
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:59,530
percent HTTP deployment and now we

1862
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:01,599
rolling in over 75 and over almost 85

1863
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:03,550
United States um and we have a ten

1864
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,650
percent bump in the last year I remember

1865
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:07,690
going back five years it felt a lot of

1866
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:08,860
us like encryption was stalled like how

1867
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:10,540
do we actually get to have encryption

1868
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:12,429
everywhere but now actually we're

1869
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:14,070
looking at a hundred percent web um you

1870
01:18:12,429 --> 01:18:16,120
know encryption and that's like insight

1871
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:18,580
so that's an amazing thing for me to

1872
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,870
feel open this in collaboration or the

1873
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,980
core principles of this conference and

1874
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:22,900
what I want to tell you here is

1875
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:24,519
collaboration works and not only that

1876
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,170
it's necessary for any large-scale

1877
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,610
change and that's how we're changing the

1878
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:30,480
world right now it's a privilege to be

1879
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,480
part of that thank you

1880
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,239
well said this is exactly what we lure

1881
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:48,119
kryptos about well said all right so

1882
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:49,650
thank you all and I again I want to

1883
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:51,630
remind everybody that we're looking for

1884
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:53,670
nominations for next year

1885
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:56,219
so go nominate please we take the

1886
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:58,830
nominations very seriously and we select

1887
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:01,500
from what we get from the community so

1888
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:02,699
with that thank you all again well we're

1889
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,409
gonna have we're gonna break for lunch

1890
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:06,599
now lunch is going to be served right

1891
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:08,629
outside and we'll resume again at 2:00

1892
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,630
p.m.
