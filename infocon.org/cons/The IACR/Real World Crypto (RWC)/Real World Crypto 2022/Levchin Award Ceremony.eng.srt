1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
of this is what you will come for is the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,799
annual award ceremony um and it's for

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
the uh levchin price um dan bonney who

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,040
usually gives out the prize cannot be

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,519
here so i've drawn the short straw to

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
introduce it so i do apologize that i'm

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,920
not danbot a

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,960
um and

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,560
um

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
it honors major innovations in

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
cryptography that have had significant

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,960
real world impact okay so let's kind of

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
see so it was uh started in 2016 by max

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,640
levchin who if you don't know is a

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,040
serial entrepreneur who's supported a

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
lot of cryptography projects over the

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,760
years

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
he

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
was one of the people behind paypal and

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
he has uh donated in perpetuity

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,960
a award of ten thousand dollars a year

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
to two uh recipients so that's twenty

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
thousand dollars a year in total okay so

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
um while uh max also can't be here but

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,440
let's kind of give him a virtual round

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,030
of applause for supporting the community

27
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:09,119
[Applause]

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
okay so it's been going since 2016. so

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,560
we have a plethora or

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
if that's a plethora i don't know of uh

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,520
winners um and as you can see

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
um we kind of

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
divide them into every year we kind of

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
give a a one award which is for

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
long-standing achievement in applying uh

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,159
in in applications of cryptography for

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
the real world so you know you all know

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
the names of phil rogers johann damon

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
hugo kratchek larry mihir belare

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
merkel and neil and victor of um on the

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,399
on the left and then on the right we

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
normally kind of uh give an award for

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
something that's kind of got immediate

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,079
impact and has been done relatively

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,560
recently and often by

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
some well not often but kind of half the

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
time by a team of people okay so there's

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
a kind of there's a kind of method to

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,560
the madness of giving out the awards

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
what do they get they get this the left

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,599
chin trophy which is a uh cryptex

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
um and the award winners today have

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
apparently already received their um

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,840
physical thing

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,879
um

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
so i didn't have to bring it with them

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
or whatever um

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
and it's kind of based on the jefferson

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,599
wheel from

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
many many years ago

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
okay so that's that's the lovely thing

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
they will get and if a team wins it i

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
suppose they have to fight over who has

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760
it yeah so there we go

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,160
okay

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
so we're now at the point we could do

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,599
drum rolls and whatever and i don't know

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,720
yeah

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
good thank

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
you the first

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,959
the world

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,680
is to don coppersmith

73
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,740
[Applause]

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
and so i'm glad you all know who don is

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
because your clappings are great um

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
that's good uh so this is for

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
foundational innovations in crypt

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,239
analysis um

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,120
and

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
we can see uh just three of the uh

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,959
papers up there which were uh authored

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,599
by don and which were quite foundational

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,720
um

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
obviously des which we all still use

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
today i mean we all know and love it

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,519
every time we go to an atm machine is

87
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,080
we're still using des so this is like

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,599
great um uh impact on on on on

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,080
cryptography work on rsa lattice attacks

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
work on

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
discrete logarithms and don

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
um oh i'm many more apparently i missed

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
that one so don is the recipient there

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
is his prize and we can now by the magic

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
of the interweb

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
go over to don and he can uh talk to us

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
a little bit about whatever he wants to

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
say over to you dom

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
thank you nigel

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
and thanks to max

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
sorry thanks to max levchin for endowing

102
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,760
this prize and to the committee for

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,798
selecting me this year

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
i was fortunate to be in the right place

105
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
at the right time i was a summer

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
employee at ibm research in the early

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
70s and

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
i had the office next to horst feistel

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
who was the inventor of des

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
the inventor of the scheme that

111
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
eventually became des became the data

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
encryption standard which

113
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
since

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,320
horst was generous with his time and his

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,440
guidance my task that summer

116
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
was to strengthen des against

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,479
differential cryptanalysis

118
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
it was a wonderful summer job

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
the initial real world impetus for an

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
encryption algorithm came from a

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
particular large bank

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,440
large bank which wanted to secure

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
communication between its central

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,479
computers

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,240
and these newfangled atms

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
so des needed to provide privacy

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
as well as security against tampering

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
with messages on route

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
but once the des was in place

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
all sorts of applications presented

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
themselves

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,280
and

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
these applications continued to expand

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
over the years

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,199
ibm allowed me latitude to work on

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,080
projects of my own taste which included

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
signature schemes

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
integer factorization with partial

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
information

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,000
[Music]

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
discrete logarithms and finite fields of

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
characteristic 2

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
and which of course are

144
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,319
applicable to rsa and to diffie element

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
i was able to dabble with message

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
authentication schemes and various

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
public key schemes

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
it was a

149
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
uh it was a great environment to work in

150
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
because you could

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
work in what you needed to

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
but a favorite occupation of mine in

153
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
those days was serving on

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
many program committees

155
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,400
for crypto or eurocrypt

156
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,919
so you you guys are iacr members if you

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,800
happen to submit a paper

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
to crypto or eurocrypt in the early in

159
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
the 90s or the early 2000s

160
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
and if that paper happened to have a

161
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
proposed crypto scheme

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
and you might have gotten by feedback

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
from the committee to the effect that

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
uh this paper is rejected because the

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,479
committee has discovered a devastating

166
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
attack against this crypto scheme namely

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
x y and z

168
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
that was me

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
sorry

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,060
was asked to give a p and

171
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,919
[Applause]

172
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
i was asked to give opinions on where

173
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,479
real world cryptography is going or

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,160
where it ought to go

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
and that's a tough question it was a lot

176
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,319
easier to answer in the old days

177
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,639
when the applications were commercial

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,039
cryptography banks and stuff

179
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,759
or military and diplomatic

180
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
the purview of government agencies

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
a certain quid crow a certain

182
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,960
quid pro quo was clear then

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
if we have high grade cryptography and

184
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
nobody can read our mail then probably

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
they have high grade

186
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
cryptography and nobody can read their

187
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,720
mail either

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
but some newer applications have such

189
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,199
far-reaching negative effects i'm

190
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
thinking particularly of

191
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
cryptocurrency which has enabled

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
untraceable ransom payments and thus

193
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,919
encouraged exorbitant ransom demands

194
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,639
i'm very sorry to see that happen

195
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
and

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
i wish that that scheme

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,960
had never escaped from pandora's box

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
um

199
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,199
again thank you to the committee and

200
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,360
thank you to max lovechin and thank you

201
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,780
for your attention

202
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,559
[Applause]

203
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,799
[Applause]

204
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
uh thank you don and um

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
i i perceive it's a different time in

206
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
the day for you so you could you've had

207
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
to get up early for this so thank you

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
very much for that thank you

209
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
once more anna paul

210
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
and

211
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
back to the slides please

212
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,959
yeah okay so

213
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,160
the second award is to let's encrypt

214
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,849
[Applause]

215
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,519
and

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
and the uh

217
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
citation is the word is for fundamental

218
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,959
improvements to the certificate

219
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
ecosystem that provides three

220
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
certificates for all and um anyone who's

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
kind of followed

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
certificates knows that lexington huge

223
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
impact

224
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
on certificates so this is the uh a

225
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
graph

226
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,240
um from a couple of days ago or going

227
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
back to the year dot which in their days

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
was 2016 of the certificates issued per

229
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,160
day by let's let's encrypt so these this

230
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,120
is

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
the certificates per day issued which

232
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
therefore is securing the internet

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,399
securing websites for free for everybody

234
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
so that's really cool

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
and here's the team

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
and um we have josh

237
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
who's going to come up

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,880
in person and say a few words

239
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,269
[Applause]

240
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,139
[Applause]

241
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
thank you so much uh we really

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
appreciate this recognition and thanks

243
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
to the real world crypto steering

244
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
committee and max levchin

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
i'm tempted to name names but there are

246
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,560
a lot of people who have devoted a

247
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
pretty significant portion of their life

248
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
to this work it'd be a long list i'm

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
worried i might forget somebody so

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
i hope you know who you are and i hope

251
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
you're proud as i am today

252
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
though currently let's encrypt is used

253
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,440
by about 280 million websites and we

254
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
issue a few million sorts per day

255
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,560
when i was thinking about same thing

256
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,839
maybe i should think back on this

257
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
experience and maybe i can come up with

258
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
some kind of profound nugget of wisdom

259
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
to pass on other people i'm not sure

260
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,320
that i have succeeded in that so i

261
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
apologize for that but i got five

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
minutes you're here i'm here so i'm

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,560
gonna give you some thoughts anyway

264
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
as you might expect i think this started

265
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
with a pretty good idea and a strong

266
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
team and we kept focus

267
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
on the things that are important and i

268
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
think one of the most important things

269
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,160
to us is ease of use

270
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
in the beginning those of us who are

271
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
thinking about this problem we're

272
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
thinking about you know there's billions

273
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
of people in the world who are living

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
more and more of their lives online and

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
they deserve a more privacy you know a

276
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,839
more secure and privacy respecting

277
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
experience and if we wanted to give them

278
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,399
that we were going to have to move

279
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
hundreds of millions of websites to

280
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
https

281
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
not only we want them to move to https

282
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
we wanted that to happen fast at least

283
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
on an internet time scale like we wanted

284
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
most of them to switch within three to

285
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
five years so we spent a lot of time

286
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,959
thinking about this difficult problem in

287
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
front of us and we consider a lot of

288
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,279
options

289
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,760
and then in the end you know what became

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
let's encrypt started in a new ca of a

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
certain type

292
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
really seemed like the only option that

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
was going to work and in hindsight

294
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
it feels like a good and rewarding idea

295
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,920
to have done that but at the time

296
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
honestly it was a bit of a frustrating

297
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
conclusion to come to it

298
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,800
it's not an easy solution to commit to

299
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
it meant building an organization

300
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
raising money hiring a bunch of people

301
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
building a ca from scratch something i

302
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
did not know how to do at the time

303
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
certainly

304
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,519
and

305
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,560
it's just

306
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,439
it's a lot of work

307
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,639
i think

308
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
there's a part of all of us that just

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
wanted to find a little bit easier

310
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
solution that wasn't gonna you know we

311
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
didn't have to stand up for an

312
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
organization that might last two decades

313
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
maybe it works maybe it doesn't

314
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
we wanted to find something a little

315
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
easier maybe we make a dent in the

316
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
problem and move on to other interesting

317
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
solutions but

318
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,920
it really seemed like this needed to

319
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,399
happen so we we set out to build it we

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
built a great team initially mostly

321
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
volunteers with a couple staff and over

322
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,639
time that ratio reversed but we're still

323
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
really fortunate that today we have a

324
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
huge community of volunteers who help us

325
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
with everything from translating our

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
websites

327
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
to

328
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
you know offering great advice on our

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
community forums maintaining a bunch of

330
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,839
the client software that people use

331
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,519
there's dozens if not hundreds of pieces

332
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
of client software for let's encrypt

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
we're really grateful to that community

334
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
day to day there's just 11 engineers

335
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
that work on let's encrypt and there's a

336
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,279
small team that work alongside them

337
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
working on things like fundraising

338
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
communications and administration

339
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,839
so it's not a big team for a big job and

340
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,200
this includes

341
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,560
you know there's a lot of rules in our

342
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
industry

343
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
the tech can be a little complicated

344
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
there's audits there's a lot of high

345
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
expectations for security and

346
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
reliability so it's a huge job and these

347
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,199
these people are doing incredible work

348
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
eventually we're going to serve maybe a

349
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
billion websites and we're getting ready

350
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
for that today and when that happens the

351
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
team will be a little bit bigger

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
but probably not a lot bigger um

353
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,600
efficiency is really important to us and

354
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
it's important for two reasons the the

355
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
first reason is is more principled

356
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,600
is that

357
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
we think it's our responsibility to do

358
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
the most good that we can with the

359
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
dollars that are entrusted to us

360
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
and the second reason is a little more

361
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
you know out of necessity

362
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
raising money is hard it is

363
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
you know we have to get our mission done

364
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
on what's available to us

365
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
so

366
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,519
yeah efficiency is really important this

367
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
team is doing amazing work

368
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
it's no surprise that

369
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,639
ease of use is really important to any

370
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
success that we've had we try to make

371
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,480
easy watson crypt as easy to use as

372
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
possible

373
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
i think it's sort of underrated how

374
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
important the strategy that our

375
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
certificates are free

376
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
is to the ease-of-use question it's not

377
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,839
just a question of money and how much

378
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
people are willing or able to pay

379
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
not charging people is a really

380
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
important part of ease of use because if

381
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
you charge people that it prevents you

382
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
from fully automating your system at

383
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,480
some point someone's gonna have to find

384
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
a credit card maybe that's going in your

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
wallet but maybe that's

386
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,120
spending three weeks in a corporate

387
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
approval process so eliminating the

388
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
payment question is a huge part of ease

389
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,399
of use because it lets us truly automate

390
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
our service living payments are also

391
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
important for our reach so i'm really

392
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
proud of the fact that we serve every

393
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,079
single country in the world today

394
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,160
there are people who need that

395
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
but if we charge anything for that we'd

396
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,399
have a whole bunch of sanctions that

397
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,959
come into play are additional sanctions

398
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
and a bunch of financial logistics that

399
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
would really limit the reach that we

400
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
have today so

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
all these factors the financial stuff in

402
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
particular led us to create a non-profit

403
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
called internet secure research group

404
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
isrg to support let's encrypt and we're

405
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
so thankful to everybody who has

406
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
financially supported our organization

407
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,839
and the work that we do over the years

408
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
it you know

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
it's how we get everything done as

410
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,920
people who who recognize the value of

411
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
tls everywhere and contribute

412
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
so we're pretty easy to use today

413
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
i think especially under normal

414
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
circumstances but we can do better there

415
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
are exceptional circumstances where we

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
can do a better job with ease of use

417
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
you know one of the things i'm most

418
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,440
excited about right now is some work

419
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
we're doing in the ietf around acme

420
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
renewal info which is going to help with

421
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
sort of mass revocation events

422
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
resiliency is really important in a pki

423
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,199
ecosystem

424
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,920
automated smooth resiliency is even

425
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,279
better so i'm really excited about that

426
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,880
work and

427
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,399
the progress we can make on easy views

428
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,720
over the next few years

429
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,680
so

430
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
wrap up a couple more thoughts on ease

431
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
of use

432
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,440
it's not it's not just about

433
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
the software it's about this sort of

434
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,000
positivoid dance for three i'm a ballet

435
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,959
fan

436
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,839
between software finance and and legal

437
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
and these things really need to work

438
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,320
together to make a service that

439
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,639
has a great outcome

440
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,000
it's going to continue to be important

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
for our future projects uh i'm excited

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,839
with some privacy preserving metrics

443
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,880
work that we're doing you'll get a

444
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,399
chance to hear about that in some

445
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
sessions this afternoon

446
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,079
ease of use gonna be critical there so

447
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,559
thank you so much um again we really

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,959

those nominations to submit a nomination

459
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
completely privately you can't look at

460
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
other people's nominations that would be
