1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
three guests on stage and and the idea

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,080
of this session is that you get to ask

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,080
them anything within reason

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,040
um

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
and um but i think it'd be nice to start

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,240
maybe with a couple of minutes of

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
introduction from each of our uh

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,519
panelists each of our celebrities and

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,680
uh i'm gonna start with yuan and maybe

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
you could just take a couple of minutes

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
to introduce yourself if you don't mind

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,119
yeah you yeah yeah

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,640
and then then we'll do kathy and then

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
we'll do then we'll do you i think that

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,519
will help seek questions from the

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,160
audience so maybe

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,880
i didn't prepare anything so uh yeah so

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
i um diamond i um

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
do symmetric crypto

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,640
i did a phd at the time at cosic

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
at 95 and then i went to work for

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,200
industry

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
and i continued to collaborate

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
with vincent who i met at uh kylie

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,879
leuven

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
and we did a series of papers that led

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
eventually to reindeer which became a

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,640
yes

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
and that

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,760
gave me the opportunity to do crypto

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,240
research free crypto research at the

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
company i was working on and my boss

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
even

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,880
that

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
kind of was um i should say

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,159
um

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,560
shielding me from the upper management

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
and to do what i like and that's

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
when i met sheil vanash and mikhail

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
peters

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
and we did

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
research that would lead with a lot of

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
detours to finally catch up which became

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
chatri

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,200
and then

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,439
at some point

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,720
i got on the radar of hotboat university

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
and i started there one day per week

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,119
and later two days per week you know

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,479
three days per week and then five days

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,479
per week and i'm now there since i think

52
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,720
2018 full-time or 17

53
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
and i have now a team and i tried to

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
keep them busy with the same symmetric

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
crypto we're trying to innovate

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
that's it great thank you johan so if

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
you want to win in this competition you

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
know who to go to

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
okay kathy could you give us a quick

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
introduction thank you hi cathy yun

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,200
um let's see where to begin well i um

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
currently am at google i've done sort of

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
a variety of things at google i've done

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
like protocol design for cryptography

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,680
i've done security reviews focusing on

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
cryptography and ads

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
and i'm currently working on fhe and

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
prior to that i worked on zero knowledge

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
proofs in the blockchain space um

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
co-wrote the bulletproofs library with

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
henry and oleg

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
and prior to that i was at mit for

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
undergrad and my master's

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,599
i did my master's with vinod and shafi

75
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,000
doing function secret sharing so that's

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,879
a little

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
about me thank you very much welcome to

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
the stage

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
hi i'm yuval um i'm currently to the

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
university of adelaide in australia

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,519
i mainly work on trying to understand

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,120
what

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
computers do when we tell them what we

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
want them to do

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
and

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,519
how that affect the the security that

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
they claim to promise

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
and

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
before that

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,319
i've been i've done my phd at the

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,599
university of adelaide so it's homegrown

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,720
and they

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
before that i've been a bit in the

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
industry and

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
yeah then it's really far in the past i

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,959
don't remember much

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,440
thank you and welcome great so if you

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
have a question for our panelists either

99
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
collectively or individually just come

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
up to the mic and

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
join the queue there currently there are

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
zero people in the queue so until the

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
queue forms i'm going to start off with

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
a question for our three panelists

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
um i read on twitter today that tomorrow

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
is world quantum day

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,080
um

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
apparently so if you go to the twitter

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
account world quantum day you can read

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,959
all about it

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
doesn't matter

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
it depends on which side of that you

113
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,560
look

114
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
so you guys need to share three mics

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
between two um so i guess you just

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
indicate to each other so do should we

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
really care about quantum computers is

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,439
it really a thing

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
yeah

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,918
but

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
yeah i think it it helps um keeping a

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
lot of good mathematicians busy

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,919
so

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
maybe it exists maybe it doesn't but at

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
least there's a lot of mathematicians

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
that get a job because of it because

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
again they can do crypto research or

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
they can do mathematical research

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
calling it crypto so

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,479
i think it's good and if a quantum

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,919
computer exists we will have what it

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,040
takes

133
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
but if we have what it takes maybe it

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
doesn't there's no need to develop a

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
quantum computer anymore so yeah

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
okay thank you

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,000
other panelists i mean you can just say

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
pass if you want to pass that's also

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,479
okay

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
you get three passes and then and then

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
it seems hard to evaluate the

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,639
probability but the impact of that small

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,960
probability is high enough that i think

144
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,479
it makes sense to at least look at

145
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,440
hybrid

146
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
um options

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
well um

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
i guess from my perspective

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,199
it gives

150
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,080
cryptographers incentives to develop new

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,759
cryptographic schemes and the new

152
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
cryptographic schemes offer new

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,759
opportunities for people that want to

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,039
break them

155
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,800
and

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,440
but until i really get a

157
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
quantum computer under the oscilloscope

158
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
then

159
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
i don't know what they are used useful

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
for

161
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
okay thank you so now we can come to the

162
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,479
line and i see you already eleanor's

163
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,440
there so go ahead yes so i'm helena

164
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,639
uh my question is probably for yuval

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
i would like to know how you stumbled

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
across micro architectural side channels

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
how did that come about there were other

168
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
side channels before but this is totally

169
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
new and kind of out of the blue and how

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
how did that happen

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
so

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
i assume that we are talking about the

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
recent wave and um

174
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,400
the way it happened is uh in chess 2017

175
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,719
not like what was in the uh

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
in santa barbara i think 2016 2016-17

177
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,680
one of those

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
i spoke with a

179
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
mike hamburg

180
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,520
and

181
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,800
he suggested hey you know that there is

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
speculative execution

183
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
and that might

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
might do something

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
and then we uh

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
we started looking at that and uh

187
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
i guess that

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
admitting

189
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
failures at this stage i looked at that

190
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
as a way of breaking a

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,479
donna 64 way of breaking a

192
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
cryptographical implementations only

193
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,400
uh

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
next chess 2017

195
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759
we met

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
paul kocher and we discussed that with

197
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,720
him and

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
he showed us that it can be used for

199
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
more than that so we had things working

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,479
and he showed us how to use that and

201
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,680
that specter

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
and after that it

203
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
just exploded so

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
it's a new field now so thank you

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
so maybe i can ask a quick follow-up

206
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
should we care about psychiatrists

207
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
um

208
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
probably about as much as we should care

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
about the

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
mpc fully homomorphic encryption we

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,160
should care about the quantum computers

212
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
okay

213
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
thanks um there's a question in the chat

214
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,960
actually specifically uh for kathy um

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,599
muhammad usama sardar is asking

216
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
what kind of tools are used in google

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
for verification of security of

218
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,560
protocols

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,759
is that something you can say something

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,560
about

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
um that's not something i directly work

222
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,319
on i know

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
jade is an audience somewhere works on

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
formal verification in general and um is

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
working on trust zone so that's

226
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,919
something that is looking at formal

227
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,520
verification i also know there's project

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,800
oak which does formal verification um so

229
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
yeah those are teams that exist but

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
that's sort of the extent of my

231
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
knowledge okay thanks

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
uh nigel oh yeah so i kind of noticed um

233
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
this is the first conference for two

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
years so i noticed there's a bunch of

235
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
people here i don't know so there's

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
loads more youngsters in the audience

237
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,319
okay and they probably don't want to get

238
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
up and ask this question but you've got

239
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
people here who you know we're in

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
academia people in a big corporation

241
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
someone who's went from a big

242
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
corporation and jumped into academia

243
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,440
what advice do you have to all these uh

244
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,599
young people in the audience who are

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
looking to step out on their career or

246
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
those who are looking for a change in

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,919
direction

248
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,560
you and you've not said anything for a

249
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
while why don't you take it i'm not

250
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
the guy giving career advice

251
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,040
i'm the worst person possible i think

252
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
i think you should do what you like

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
what's your passion i follow your

254
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
passion that's i think what you should

255
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
do

256
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
and that can make you happy

257
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,560
if you want some pseudo advice

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
i feel like it's really helpful to have

259
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
in whatever capacity you're able to but

260
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
have a little taste of both whether

261
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
that's you know doing internships at

262
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
companies but doing research just to

263
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,839
understand if you're doing research

264
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,399
who's going to end up using this

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,680
to inform

266
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,399
your direction of research

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
yeah

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
i guess

269
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
very similar

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
do do what you believe in do what you

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
think is is interesting what you find

272
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,839
interesting because if you do what

273
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
someone else finds interesting you'll

274
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,560
get bored

275
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
okay thank you um so from the chat um

276
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,760
kevin mccurley no less is asking for any

277
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
of you what do you think will ultimately

278
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
happen with cryptocurrencies

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,959
he's a controversialist well-known

280
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
controversialist

281
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
i can take the hat seat i think that

282
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
some really cool cryptography is going

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,519
to come out of it

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,200
unclear about the rest though but you

285
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
know i'm excited about the cryptography

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
part there's some really cool work

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,279
happening in this space there's a

288
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
smattering of applause there but it's

289
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
not wholehearted applause for those

290
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
maybe we should do maybe should we do a

291
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,480
quick poll of the audience since you

292
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
know everybody's here so hands up if you

293
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
think the effect of cryptocurrencies is

294
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
a net positive for the world

295
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
oh

296
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,600
to the world

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
not for us for the world

298
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,519
and hands if you think if it's a net

299
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
negative

300
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
okay that's like 80 20 maybe even 85 15

301
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
i would say

302
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
that's very interesting uh so other

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,440
other views on cryptocurrencies from the

304
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
panelists

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
yeah there's mostly this uh

306
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,680
ecological aspect of course of all this

307
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
mining and i don't see a solution for

308
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,560
that so

309
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
except for the uh

310
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
there are like

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,880
interesting problems there it's not

312
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
for cryptography for a

313
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
other stuff but

314
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
overall uh i don't see anything

315
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,200
positive that came from the

316
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
cryptocurrencies themselves outside the

317
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,200
things that how they operate and the

318
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,279
how we can build them answering these

319
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
questions so as an academic exercise

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
they would have been wonderful

321
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
um at least from my like

322
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
from what i've seen because i used to

323
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,959
work on zero knowledge proofs in the

324
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,680
blockchain space i think that um like

325
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
cryptocurrencies have allowed for and

326
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,200
like funded so much interesting research

327
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,279
and really pushed that space forward and

328
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
now we have way more efficient proofs

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
and now we can do things in like

330
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
for instance google where we're like hey

331
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,399
now we have really efficiency and

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
knowledge proofs where can we use that

333
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
for different applications like you know

334
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
federated learning or you know other you

335
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
know

336
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
other places where you'd want to do uh

337
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
verification so i think that's really um

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
helpful and it's maybe sort of like

339
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,200
arguing you know when we like

340
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
you know launch rockets we get like

341
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
velcro out of that it's like maybe maybe

342
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
velcro is like very tangential but at

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,680
least for um for me i am very interested

344
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,320
in the velcro part so i'm very excited

345
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,279
thank you

346
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
uh chris i think is it yeah go ahead

347
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
chris uh my question's for kathy um but

348
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
for starters did you say at the

349
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
beginning that you're getting into the

350
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,079
fhe space for the first time

351
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
yes okay um so that's perfect um

352
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
two questions the first is uh can you

353
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
tell us a little bit about some of the

354
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
applications of aph you've been thinking

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,519
about and what do you make of the field

356
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,680
so far overall

357
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
right so um some context is i just

358
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,839
changed teams within google to work on

359
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,800
fhe so i'm yeah super new to the space

360
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
um i think the math is super fun it's

361
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
not very apparent to me

362
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
what um applications there are that are

363
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
practical right now i think the like

364
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
moonshot applications are like if fh is

365
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
super practical everyone can like

366
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
encrypt all of their data and then have

367
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
someone else do computation for them or

368
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
even join encrypted computation sets

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,760
between like healthcare providers or

370
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
anything else that is handling really

371
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
sensitive data so that would be really

372
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,079
cool

373
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,160
but i think you know as iran um

374
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
mentioned in his uh talk

375
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
right now it's really really impractical

376
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
and so i think we have many years of

377
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
work before we get to a place where like

378
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
yeah just you know send your fhe

379
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
encrypted data to the cloud and then

380
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
like have them do compute for you um

381
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,000
that'll probably

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
not be something we see for a bit um but

383
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
i'm very excited to

384
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
work in that direction can i ask a quick

385
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
follow-up of course

386
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,120
give me enough money

387
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
um is there anything you learned over

388
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
the last couple of days that gave you

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
hope about the practicality of ffhe

390
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
i think there are a lot of like

391
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
super smart people working on every step

392
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959
along the way and i think that's like

393
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
very exciting and does give me hope

394
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,560
where it's like you know everywhere all

395
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
the way down to like different the

396
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
hardware level and then all the way up

397
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,160
to like how do we do efficient compiling

398
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
from you know generic statements into

399
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
different backends and so just seeing

400
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
people come together and like

401
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,519
trade ideas and collaborate um

402
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
yeah gets me excited about maybe

403
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,199
it's not like a five-year thing maybe

404
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,240
it's like a three-year thing i don't

405
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,160
know um exactly what the timeline looks

406
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
like for this to be usable thank you

407
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,839
very much

408
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,360
thanks for the question i have one more

409
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
here from the um from the chat and this

410
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,519
may require some interpretation on your

411
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
part i'm doing my best so suppose you

412
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
have a blob of data

413
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
what provides greater security and

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,199
cryptography using any cipher to create

415
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
cipher text or cryptography using image

416
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,519
steganography to obfuscate the bob

417
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,600
and um sorry if i was giving you evil

418
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
works

419
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
i don't i only ask the questions i don't

420
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
state the questions i i didn't get the

421
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
last words there what they are so image

422
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
is something a steganography to

423
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
obfuscate the book so should we use

424
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
steganography or should we use real

425
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,839
cryptography

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,639
i feel like this is the wrong audience

427
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,800
to ask if you want a varied answer to

428
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,680
that

429
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
we should go through about steganography

430
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
next week yes

431
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
i think um image steganography may work

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
in the same way that security through

433
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
obscurity works

434
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,839
yeah

435
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,959
you know i i've never seen a

436
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,120
steganography scheme that um would hold

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
to a

438
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
little scrutiny so

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,079
i would go with cryptography okay

440
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,839
thanks you and you're also noting i have

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
nothing to add i agree completely yeah

442
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
okay

443
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,199
thank you very much okay simon you have

444
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,560
a question

445
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
hi so

446
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
we all know that rules law is dead now

447
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,399
uh what does that going to do with

448
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,839
crypto research

449
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
can we just continue looking at cool

450
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,519
mars and

451
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
go forward with that or do we need to

452
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,240
say we need

453
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,519
to focus more on efficiency and

454
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,360
to support all the new

455
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
applications as well

456
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,839
that are emerging into the market

457
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,519
can you say what you said in the

458
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
beginning what is it was law sorry it

459
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
was law uh the transistors are getting

460
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
smaller and smaller

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,440
so

462
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
i would say why not both there is enough

463
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
room for everyone

464
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,800
other panelists want to say anything

465
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,560
no

466
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,599
okay thanks for the question

467
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,480
it is an ema so you can ask anything

468
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
me again yep

469
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
so you won maybe this time yes um

470
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,919
given that you already have i guess two

471
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
winning algorithms in this competitions

472
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
what is your pitch right now to get the

473
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
third one as a winner too yeah

474
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
in the lightweight crypto section this

475
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,400
time

476
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
yeah but i think it will not happen this

477
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,679
time

478
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,720
why not

479
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,679
yeah just that's my feeling

480
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
yeah

481
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
what are you very much counting on

482
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,559
i'm not counting on it no no

483
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,640
no but i think we just tried to break

484
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
better algorithms for the future

485
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
yeah and the current

486
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
competition is just more like

487
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
the current thing but let's try to make

488
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,559
things for the future that's what we try

489
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
to do yeah if they pick our thing it's

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
fine but if they don't

491
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,000
it's too bad but i'm not counting on it

492
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
no

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
shall we bet

494
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,240
shall we bet maybe yeah no i'm not gonna

495
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
bet against my own proposal

496
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
no i'm not doing that

497
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,120
okay thanks

498
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,840
mateo go ahead

499
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
so speaking to the man who gave us shah

500
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
3 and as

501
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
beside

502
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
unpronounceable names what's the secret

503
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
ingredient of very strong cryptography

504
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,400
[Music]

505
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
that's a difficult question no but

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
yeah like

507
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,520
yes

508
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
the nice thing was that we were already

509
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
years

510
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,840
uh

511
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
working on it

512
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
before this competition started so

513
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
vincent and myself and we actually had

514
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,799
already done what they were asking

515
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
before they asked it so that was kind of

516
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
we had a head start

517
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
that was

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
and for satri i don't know

519
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,280
i don't know

520
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
but we also took a long we really

521
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
invested a lot of time

522
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
and it was like uh

523
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
open research so it was not we didn't

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,360
have to publish

525
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,760
we were just looking at the crypto so it

526
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,640
was not

527
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
we were not under pressure of producing

528
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,880
a psd or having students that have a phd

529
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039
we could really do free research

530
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,880
and that really helped

531
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
and i messed up now a bit because now i

532
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
really have all these students that have

533
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,799
to get a phd so i have to publish so we

534
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,919
have to

535
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,559
write papers about stuff but i would

536
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,679
rather do

537
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,120
open research but yeah

538
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
so the answer is open research and time

539
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
i think so yes but also luck of course

540
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
so you must be lucky a bit

541
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,280
to be in the right place at the right

542
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
time yeah i work with great people so

543
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
because it's not me yeah it's the team

544
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
it's with vincent and it's with uh with

545
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
jill and mikael and guido

546
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
yeah thank you for your answer

547
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
thanks so we have a question uh in the

548
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,480
chat here specifically for you val

549
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
um what do you think will be the future

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
of intel sgx

551
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,919
is that what do i think or what do i

552
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,919
hope

553
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so uh intel has uh

554
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,559
stopped producing uh the sjx for uh

555
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,360
the end user and um

556
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
there's a lot of speculation on in the

557
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
uh

558
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,320
on the internet on why they did that and

559
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
probably the

560
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,200
most appealing

561
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,360
answer i think is that

562
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,039
at the end of the day if you have

563
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,360
physical access to a machine that has

564
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,080
enough secrets you will break it

565
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,280
uh

566
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
our defenses against physical attacks

567
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
tend to put a price on how they attack

568
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,559
how

569
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,840
costly the attack is rather than

570
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,360
probably protect

571
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
and

572
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
and the original

573
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
security guarantees were not

574
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
it could not all be in practice

575
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
uh so

576
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
it seems they are shifting it towards a

577
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,840
towards servers only and in servers

578
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,679
we still have the

579
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,760
assumption that maybe the cloud provider

580
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,679
cannot access the data inside sgx or

581
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,240
so we don't have that guarantee but we

582
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
need this guarantee less

583
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
and sgx becomes sort of defense in depth

584
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
it's another defense mechanism that we

585
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,320
can use if we need slightly more

586
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,840
a lot more protection

587
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,640
so

588
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,320
i believe that it will continue or

589
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
something like it will continue because

590
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,120
it serves

591
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,600
an important purpose it does protect us

592
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,400
from

593
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
the um

594
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
cleaning crew in the

595
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,679
in the cloud providers but

596
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
it's not 100 protection as

597
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
some people try to sell it to market it

598
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
thank you kathy do you want to add

599
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,919
something what's up no just agreeing

600
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,799
yeah

601
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
good so i i have a question um

602
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,559
so

603
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,799
we saw these great talks today about how

604
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,720
techniques like prio are very quickly

605
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
going from research papers into

606
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
production

607
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
we also saw in the morning thought a

608
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,559
really wonderful talk about crypto

609
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,559
developers and how they see cryptography

610
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,039
and problems that they really care about

611
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,600
so is the gap between theory and

612
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
practice and cryptography narrowing or

613
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,120
is it increasing in size

614
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,080
i think for everybody but yeah kathy

615
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
sorry go ahead

616
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
maybe there's like a there's like quite

617
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,400
a broad spread even just like talking

618
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
within google there's like a large

619
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
spread from like now me working on fhe

620
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
being like really experimental to like

621
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
folks working on more practical things

622
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
like mariana talking about

623
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,360
exposure notifications and so i think um

624
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
on the side of

625
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
uh

626
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
folks who are working on things that

627
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,799
have a very clear end use

628
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,360
i do think that that gap is narrowing

629
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
but because

630
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,159
there are people working on that and

631
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,840
proving that hey cryptography is like an

632
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
interesting technology to invest in

633
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,919
therefore companies are maybe more

634
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,360
willing to take the risk to invest in

635
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
things that are longer tail like longer

636
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
term investments and so there um maybe

637
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,200
the gap is still very wide

638
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,480
thanks the other panelists some of you

639
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
intermediate crypto is narrowing so

640
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,159
because the requirements are much more

641
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,559
real worlds and we build no longer block

642
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,080
cycles but we build authenticated

643
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
encryption we look at site channel so i

644
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,159
think it's really improving and the

645
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,760
current landscape is much more much

646
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,840
better than 20 years ago for instance

647
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
yeah you got any thoughts i i you really

648
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,320
don't have the um

649
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
the the uh

650
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
historical view to

651
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,600
i'm not cryptography by uh

652
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,720
trade

653
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
okay thanks

654
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,559
uh there's a question in the line uh

655
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,200
i'll just add really quickly um maybe as

656
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
a teaser for the talks tomorrow i do

657
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
think that um one trend that we're

658
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
seeing like in industry is that there's

659
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,400
more of a push for privacy in like data

660
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,480
management so i think like privacy

661
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
sandbox is going to talk tomorrow about

662
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,039
that um in the ads ecosystem and meta as

663
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,880
well um and so there is a little bit

664
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,559
more industry push of like we want

665
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,320
interesting cryptography so that we can

666
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
keep your data private but still like

667
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
extract interesting information for ads

668
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,440
purposes and so that is a big driver of

669
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,200
like you know

670
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,799
applying cryptography and closing that

671
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
gap

672
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,039
i'm gonna turn the conversation in

673
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
something more practical so

674
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
whether your opinion on

675
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,159
passwords versus biometrics

676
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
passwords versus biometrics

677
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,799
the age-old question

678
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,120
guess you can always change your

679
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,230
password

680
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,610
[Laughter]

681
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
any comments from the panel

682
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
i find it practical that i can sign with

683
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
my finger on my

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
iphone so that's really practical yeah i

685
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
don't know how secure it is but i assume

686
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,799
it's secure enough no i signed a pdf

687
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,200
document the other day by um typing my

688
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,559
name in and then it turned it into

689
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,880
something it looked like writing so is

690
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
that a biometric i don't know

691
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,520
it's like okay

692
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
you know um

693
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
again i don't know much um i i tend to

694
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,039
trust passwords more because i

695
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,360
understand them more i stand where they

696
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
can fail more

697
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
but

698
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,400
i think that biometrics are

699
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
somewhat useful

700
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
as john said uh

701
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
it's easier than typing a password

702
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
easier than remembering a password

703
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
but

704
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,080
it's a difficult one what people will

705
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,400
decide i guess

706
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,880
i think maybe for this crowd passwords

707
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
are like safer because we understand

708
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,000
that we have to like set good passwords

709
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,080
but maybe for um

710
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
like the general population just rolling

711
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,960
out biometrics for like logging in might

712
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
result in better security as a whole

713
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,720
um i will add those that i really really

714
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,520
dislike the fingerprint biometrics

715
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,600
because i climb and then after i climb i

716
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,760
can no longer unlock my phone

717
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,680
very annoying so

718
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,520
[Applause]

719
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
that's my personal gripe thanks

720
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
uh deirdre

721
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
hi if

722
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
i publish a paper and it gets accepted

723
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
to a conference and then some person

724
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
goes and implements it and deploys it in

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
their crypto system and there's a bug is

726
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,360
the program committee that accepted that

727
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,410
paper responsible for those bugs

728
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,480
[Music]

729
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
i don't think this but there are people

730
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,000
on the internet who think this

731
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
after published

732
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,640
now yeah after publishing

733
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,440
f bugs part of life and uh we have

734
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,159
mistakes and we have whichever science

735
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
advances by finding the uh mistakes of

736
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
previous works

737
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
if you got a proof uh paper and

738
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
proofable security and the paper

739
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,159
contains a proof and the paper is

740
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,360
accepted at the conference you would

741
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
think that the reviewers have reviewed

742
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
the proof

743
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,000
that's not the case yeah and

744
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
i was once in the program committee and

745
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,600
i thought this proof is unverifiable it

746
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
was so complex and i said yeah i cannot

747
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,240
verify the proof and then another

748
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
reviewer said yeah but it looks sure it

749
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,760
looks okay it looks okay let's accept

750
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
the paper

751
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
but that's a plausible skill that's not

752
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,640
proven

753
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
but if it is a proof and and you had a

754
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,799
bang and you have a bug in the proof and

755
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,520
it's incorrect i think that the um

756
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
honorable thing to do is to withdraw the

757
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,399
paper not wait for anyone else to

758
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,918
to do it for us yeah

759
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,559
okay did you get an answer i hope so

760
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,679
kinda

761
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,679
okay um there's a there's a question

762
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,360
we're coming to the end now but we have

763
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
a question in the chat um

764
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,799
from giorgio nicolas who says you're all

765
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,120
very experienced which means you've seen

766
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
more real world horror stories

767
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
than most when it comes to the security

768
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
and privacy of our data have you ever

769
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
dealt with paranoia concerning this and

770
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,840
if so how did you deal with it

771
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,919
i'm not sure about paranoia but tell us

772
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,440
some good war stories what's the worst

773
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,320
thing you've seen in in production or in

774
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,559
a research paper or tell us tell us your

775
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,520
worst horror stories

776
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,320
i've seen some pretty bad things but i

777
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
can't talk about them

778
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
we have also fixed them so you know

779
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
don't worry too much

780
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
good

781
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
thanks uh do you want to take a crack at

782
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,799
that one i

783
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
it's hard to think of a concrete example

784
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,360
at the moment but

785
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,559
you see

786
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,840
that that

787
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
it seems that people don't learn i guess

788
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,279
people just keep doing the same mistakes

789
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,760
that we have known about for too long

790
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,640
and

791
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
and

792
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
in a sense it's a bit disappointing uh

793
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
you know i can't complain it gives a lot

794
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,080
of us

795
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,840
good careers but

796
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
it's it is disappointing

797
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,039
things like master keys in a word

798
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,120
document and a banking master key or a

799
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
system in the word document that's

800
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
somewhere on the on the network and

801
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
things like that yeah yeah

802
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
so maybe maybe a follow-up question oh

803
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
kathy go ahead

804
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,279
oh i think um

805
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,840
one thing that i can mention is like we

806
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
have this really cool tradition at

807
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
google when you leave the security team

808
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
where you can opt into getting your

809
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,399
password stolen

810
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,640
and um and then the security team just

811
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,440
like really gets into it and so i will

812
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,159
say that even with remote work

813
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,399
um they were successful in stealing my

814
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,440
password when i left the team um and and

815
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,679
this it's one of those things of there

816
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,679
are so many interesting ways that you

817
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
can break systems and

818
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,360
most of them at least if you're looking

819
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,679
at like successful uh leaving tradition

820
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,760
hacks are not the cryptography a lot of

821
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
it's just like the system the key

822
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,200
storage you know very simple uh wrappers

823
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,679
things like that comparison

824
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,039
yeah fishing is sometimes the last

825
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,799
resort but it also gets things done

826
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
okay we have uh question the line maybe

827
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,039
this will be the last the last one okay

828
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,080
so

829
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
i've heard several times the word

830
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
privacy or privacy depending how you

831
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
want to pronounce this uh how do you

832
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,279
define privacy

833
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,080
it's philosophical

834
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,279
very loaded question

835
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,120
it depends who you ask and what their

836
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,918
motivations are

837
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,159
you ryan do you want to take a bite at

838
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,240
that one how do you define privacy yes

839
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
uh yeah i have it on a slide because we

840
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
are teaching security the first year

841
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,679
students and i don't i cannot remember

842
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
it now

843
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,919
but

844
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,799
yeah they asked our students to uh to

845
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
provide an answer to that at the exam so

846
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
i would fail at my own examination you

847
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
just take all of their answers and then

848
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,399
you average the results yeah that's what

849
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,919
we do yeah that's then that's your

850
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,880
definition of privacy yeah okay maybe um

851
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
i'll ask one more question since i think

852
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,559
we have 30 seconds left so there's a

853
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,159
truism in cryptography that you should

854
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,240
never roll your own cryptography right

855
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,360
this is something you know you shouldn't

856
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,200
design your own blog cipher

857
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,799
um and now we have to think about the

858
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,320
protocol level you shouldn't roll your

859
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,750
own protocol so who should

860
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,000
[Music]

861
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
um actually deirdre's got a really great

862
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,279
podcast

863
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,919
uh cryptography security whatever where

864
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,919
she spends a whole podcast episode

865
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,200
answering this question and i think the

866
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,559
takeaway is like

867
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
someone has to do this in the end and

868
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,919
maybe the best thing that we can do is

869
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,720
say

870
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,000
you should give it a shot but you should

871
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
get it peer reviewed bring a friend

872
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,120
basically make sure you get a lot of

873
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
eyes of people who have done this before

874
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
successfully

875
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,399
that can take a look and that way we're

876
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,039
not filtering people by confidence but

877
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,919
rather by actual competence

878
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,919
is that an okay summary

879
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,799
okay great

880
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,679
i certainly think it's true that the the

881
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,679
dunning-krieger effect you know is is

882
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,480
alive and well in cryptography um so you

883
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
and did you want to say something no no

884
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
no okay i was just accepting the mic

885
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
okay then i think that's a great place

886
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
to leave it because there should be a

887
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
reception very soon just remains to

888
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
thank all of our panelists for being so

889
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,039
game and thank you so much
