1
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,879
uh please excuse me for interrupting uh

2
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
we need to unmute the uh

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
the digital support team account

4
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,090
nigel

5
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,400
[Music]

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
on friday

7
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
and the online sorry the in-person um

8
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
lightning talk session will be here and

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,439
the way it will work is you do not have

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,040
slides

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
and everyone forms a cue

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
and the person at the front of the queue

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
gets up on stage

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
they handed the microphone they have to

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
give a a talk of a varying number of

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
seconds depending on the length of the

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,000
queue

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
and some more queue

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
less time shorter queue more time so you

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
can make you can do a denial of service

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
attack by adding people to the queue

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
um and then we kind of retort like that

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,240
we're going to put some stairs here to

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,520
make it easier for you to get up on

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,799
stage so you don't have to break your

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
necks getting up on stage so

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
that will all become clear at the time

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,320
but if you're worried about giving the

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,079
lightning talk don't don't purchase

30
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
splits don't prepare anything just be

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
prepared to talk for a varying number of

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
seconds

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
lightning okay so

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,719
with that we need to move on to the uh

35
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
next session which is on cryptographic

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
attacks on privacy

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
and the uh first speaker

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
is uh marilyn mallory noddle and she's

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,840
going to be talking about encryption and

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
runs legal challenges from around the

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,680
world over to you

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,760
[Applause]

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
hi thanks for inviting me it's been

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,760
really interesting to listen to the

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,080
talks so far and so this is a bit of a

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
turn i'm not going to be a very

47
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
technical talk but i hope it's one

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
that's useful and practical to all of

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
you to know what's going on in the

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
policy landscape

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
around encryption because there is quite

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
a bit of

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
threats to it and i consider that an end

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
run i consider that

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
you know we've built privacy preserving

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
tools we've built

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
tools to keep conversations confidential

58
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
and people secure um and the attempts to

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
to weaken encryption really are cheating

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,000
in a way um sort of not facing some of

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
the real issues um and rather trying to

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,400
force um implementers and um academics

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
and folks like yourselves to change the

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,879
technology itself and how it works so

65
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
we're constantly watchdogging that and

66
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
this is what we've learned so just to

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,239
put this in context for you

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
i work on encryption quite a bit in my

69
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
day job and at a policy nonprofit based

70
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
in washington dc called the center for

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
democracy and technology we have also an

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
office in brussels because in general

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
cdt's mandate is to look at all

74
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,319
tech policy

75
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
there's a range of issues

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
and some of those are related to privacy

77
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
and security and they have implications

78
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,319
for encryption

79
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
in addition i do work in the internet

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
engineering task force a bit i have a

81
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
research group on human rights

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
considerations for protocols

83
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,439
and i'm on the internet architecture

84
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,480
board

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
and all of this also then relates to

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
work on encryption there's folks in here

87
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
itf has been mentioned before already

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
this morning

89
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
but it's an important venue

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
and i'll talk a little bit about that

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
later

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,918
as part of my solutions

93
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
then as well then there's this global

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
encryption coalition so the global

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
encryption coalition if you haven't

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
heard of it yet is a lot of groups like

97
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
cdt that are more focused on policy or

98
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
more focused on sort of end user needs

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
um

100
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
for for a variety of reasons in in

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
technology this one though is focused on

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
keeping encryption um secure um and and

103
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
keeping the threats from policy away

104
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
although we also have worked with

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,280
private companies and implementers um on

106
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
on some of their specifications just to

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
help understand what are some of the

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
threat models for the groups that we

109
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
work with um and

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
this is we we spun up the global

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,919
encryption coalition expressly for what

112
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
i'm about to talk about there are a lot

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,280
of countries out there a lot of ways in

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
which encryption could be weakened from

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
a policy perspective so with the

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
internet society and global partners

117
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,840
digital cdt steers

118
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,800
this

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
dozens if not more than 100 members now

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
strong

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
coalition

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
and some of you in the audience are

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
advisors to that group so i thank you

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
for helping bring some real

125
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
technical knowledge to help ground

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
our policy recommendations and the work

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
that we do in the global encryption

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
coalition and just to note too um every

129
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
year on

130
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
october 21st we have global encryption

131
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,400
day just so you know

132
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
um i was afraid that might happen this

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
should be a video

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,479
oh there

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
nope

136
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
anyway there's a video we don't need to

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
show it but it's from the global

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
encryption coalition um isoc um

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
commission

140
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
okay it's no problem actually it's no

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,319
big deal let's go on but just to say

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,080
that part of the global encryption

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
coalition and its work is to be um part

144
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
of mainstream discussion so we've

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
produced a lot of or isoc in particular

146
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
has produced a lot of materials aimed at

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
end users aimed at policy makers so

148
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
we're trying as well um to

149
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
i guess sensitize these issues to a

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
broader community and that's an

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
important piece of work

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
as i'll get to also later um in some

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
cases so

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
what is global um what does encryption

155
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
policy look like what are some of the

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
threats to it there are traditionally a

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,479
few different policy pieces they're not

158
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,479
terribly controversial or that have been

159
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,039
around for a long time those are import

160
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,360
and export controls

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
a lot of governments have them related

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,360
to encryption they tend to try to define

163
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
things a little bit more specifically so

164
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,080
that companies can avoid having their

165
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
products controlled

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
with exports because that you know for

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,120
commercial reasons can be a bit of a

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,199
problem

169
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
they can be severe export and import

170
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,720
controls can be used as a way of

171
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
discouraging encryption we've seen that

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,160
in

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,479
a few countries in africa for example um

174
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
but typically they're again

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
non-controversial necessarily licensing

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,639
is another one in that bucket where you

177
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,240
have to if you make encryption

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
technology you have to obtain a special

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
license

180
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
and there may be parameters around that

181
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
depending on how restricted they are

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,919
gives you a sense of of maybe um

183
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,440
how how the country feels about

184
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
encryption in general if they're afraid

185
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
of it or they embrace it that sort of

186
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
thing um and then we've also seen maybe

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,759
in two or three cases countries that

188
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,199
actually specify

189
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
a minimum key

190
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
um length which is interesting the

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
philippines does that i think in an

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
effort to be

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
pro encryption um and then there's

194
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
another one that has a maximum

195
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
key length that you can use without

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
having actions or whatever

197
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
another one that's really important i'm

198
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
not going to focus on so much is

199
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
compelled decryption this is when you

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
know you've you've been arrested or

201
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,360
something and police officers taken you

202
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
into the station and asked you to

203
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
decrypt your iphone or your laptop or so

204
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
on that's it's a controversial one

205
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,919
because um for the most part people will

206
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
maybe comply because they just don't

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
want to be in that situation um but then

208
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
there's a lot of law around um what that

209
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
means are you incriminating yourself for

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,520
example if you're being asked to decrypt

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,639
which would be

212
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
contravening um

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
existing legal standards where you

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,839
aren't you shouldn't be compelled to do

215
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,599
that so there's that's an ongoing area

216
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,880
it's not something i want to talk about

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
but something to pay attention to

218
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
because it matters quite a lot in terms

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
of civil liberties the one i'm going to

220
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
spend most of my time talking about is

221
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,880
the last one this is lawful intercept um

222
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
so there are many proposals out there

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
some of them in law

224
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,839
of how to

225
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,120
intercept communications that is

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
encrypted and it's not just that it's

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
actually much bigger than just can you

228
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
decrypt this one piece of ciphertext

229
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
that was in

230
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
um you know a messaging app it is

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,720
actually a systemic change in a lot of

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
proposals um and and goes beyond just

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
like that one piece of cipher text and

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
it's an important actually reframe um it

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
also kind of

236
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
what we're seeing now goes beyond sort

237
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
of what we would consider

238
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
a back door quote unquote it's a lot

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
more nuanced than that so there's many

240
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
many different um

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
ways we would

242
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
what we would call a backdoor these days

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
right so this is so you can also go um

244
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
and look at this map this is by global

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
partners digital um

246
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
you could probably do a web search for

247
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
um

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
global encryption laws or policies but

249
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
it gives you a just an overview of the

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
countries that we've been looking at

251
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
some of these laws like like i said are

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
import export controls they're not

253
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
terribly interesting and it hasn't been

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
updated in quite a while but it just

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
gives you a spread of places where there

256
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
have been controversies over

257
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
the policies that have been enacted say

258
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
in the last

259
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
well some of them that are cited go back

260
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
to the early 2000s but you know in the

261
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
last say five to ten years

262
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
which is important for it to be updated

263
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
i think and something we could maybe

264
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
work on as a community

265
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,440
given that uh you know direct

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
um into encrypted messaging is now

267
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
rather ubiquitous so

268
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,920
the laws are changing

269
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
and and they're catching up

270
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,200
this is not now directly policy

271
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
related to

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
weakening encryption these are

273
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
intersections with other policies that

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
now have an impact on encryption so i'm

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
going to try to run through them i've

276
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
also tried to color code where i think

277
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,000
there are opportunities

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
in green

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,279
real threats in red and then there's

280
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,120
some ambivalence around other things so

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
let me try to run through them again

282
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
they're not going to on their surface

283
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
seem like direct threats to encryption

284
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,040
but they have implications um so maybe

285
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
the first two are obvious actually trust

286
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
and safety so for a long time there was

287
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
a narrative around terrorism so trying

288
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,519
to um you know stop

289
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,200
um other attacks after 9 11. um things

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
like that have led to a feeling that

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
there's the terrorists use encrypted

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
messaging to organize online that's a

293
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
motivator

294
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
and it's something that

295
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
police and law enforcement intelligence

296
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
communities use

297
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
as a narrative for why

298
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
encryption needs to be weakened

299
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
also now it's really popular to talk

300
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,040
about child safety so it means that

301
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,519
we've had to work with groups

302
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
that work on these issues directly child

303
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
rights in particular

304
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,160
to come up with the narrative instead

305
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
that actually of course encryption

306
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
protects children as much as it does

307
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
anyone else and to have

308
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,680
you know children be using weakened

309
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
encryption while the rest of us use

310
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,519
fine encryption or whatever seems like

311
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,120
um you know the wrong approach right or

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
whatever it is

313
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
another one that um

314
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
we have to look at is cyber crime so

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
cyber crime especially right now because

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
there's been

317
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,880
an ad hoc committee in the u.n spun up

318
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
around a new cyber crime treaty there is

319
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,800
an existing one in place but it's all

320
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,279
the way back from 2001 so it's quite out

321
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
of date as you can imagine um

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,760
there there are some um issues that

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,959
invoke

324
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,920
intellectual property so um the budapest

325
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
convention is the treaty that's in place

326
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
now

327
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
and that does talk about intellectual

328
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
property it doesn't implicate weakening

329
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,920
encryption but it would be and has been

330
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
in the past a reason

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
just like child safety and terrorism to

332
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
to try to weaken encryption criminal law

333
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
also might be another reason we'll get

334
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
to a case in bangladesh a little bit

335
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,880
later where criminal law is the sort of

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
thing that's motivating people around

337
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
this issue um but i think also there may

338
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
be an opportunity again because

339
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,079
cybercrime

340
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
can be committed against people running

341
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
encryption and trying to keep data safe

342
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
that there's a there's an opportunity to

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,959
maybe

344
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,279
define what encryption is and and what

345
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,880
it means to break it and actually keep

346
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
that safe there we'll see

347
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
um

348
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
also then a place where um encryption

349
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
policy intersects is with freedom of

350
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,839
expression freedom of association and

351
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
the right to information so if you

352
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
imagine and i i'm sure you can because

353
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
you're technical in from a technical

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,040
perspective um privacy and censorship or

355
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
anti-censorship have a lot to do with

356
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
one another because if you can't sort of

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
see who someone is or see what they're

358
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,720
looking at you can effectively

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
circumvent blocks and filters and so on

360
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
so there's a relationship there

361
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
and so in some parts of the world

362
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,760
we want to look at

363
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,040
the the ways in which encryption enable

364
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
censorship circumvention and the right

365
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
to information um

366
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
the opportunities here are pretty direct

367
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
we tend to talk about constitutional law

368
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
and the human rights framework

369
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,639
as antidotes to a lot of these threats

370
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,519
but then we have to be careful around

371
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,240
framings of information security because

372
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,399
information security is kind of like

373
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
cyber security but includes content and

374
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,959
data um and and we try to avoid that

375
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
language because we don't actually want

376
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
the content involved right

377
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
um

378
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
then of course there's a lot of work

379
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,160
folks are doing around privacy data

380
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,399
protection data localization

381
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
i would maybe put localization in orange

382
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
because having localized data centers is

383
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,320
a bit controversial and there are some

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
risks there

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
but again the opportunities in this

386
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
space are to proactively define

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,839
encryption and what it is considering it

388
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
can be implemented in so very many

389
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
different ways there's no clear

390
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,680
understanding of what is the core of

391
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
intent encryption for example

392
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
and then the other way that this works

393
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
really well in our favor against some of

394
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,639
the other threats is by talking about

395
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
proportionality so you know if you want

396
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
to perhaps

397
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
weaken encryption for the specific

398
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
target that you're going after

399
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
because of an investigation or whatever

400
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
there there's some

401
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,600
you know legal um

402
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,279
recourse around that but it's

403
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,720
disproportional to then make that week

404
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
for every single person who uses the

405
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,320
tool everywhere around the world right

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
so the proportionality

407
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
requirement is is really good then this

408
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
last one has come up really recently but

409
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
it has been around for a while actually

410
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,920
it's just now kind of in the public

411
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
discourse around interoperability so um

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
that you know we want to

413
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,839
um

414
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,839
ensure that encrypt like all of our

415
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,760
tools are interoperable it's a really

416
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,199
important principle of a free and open

417
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,759
internet um but that there could be

418
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
issues around implementation and what

419
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
that looks like if if end-to-end

420
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
encrypted messaging apps all

421
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
interoperate so there's a fine balance

422
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
there but that is coming in and it's

423
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
being invoked most recently under the

424
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,240
auspices of antitrust and competition

425
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,079
law

426
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,639
i actually want to probably move a lot

427
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
faster sway time for commons um so i

428
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
have three i'm gonna tell a story of

429
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
three different stories about where this

430
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,519
has happened um and give you a picture

431
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
it's just a tiny little sliver of what

432
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,079
is going on because i don't have a whole

433
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,160
lot of time but like i said you can look

434
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
this stuff up online so my first case is

435
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
in bangladesh and it's fairly

436
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
contemporary so the narrative that's

437
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
happening there is um

438
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
that there are

439
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
crimes being committed

440
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,519
petty theft and things like that but

441
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,680
they're all being done in a sort of

442
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,959
common

443
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,440
way they're they all look similar and

444
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
the um assumption then or what's being

445
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
talked about is that the um thieves and

446
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
crime criminals are using end-to-end

447
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,560
encrypted

448
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,120
channels to to organize

449
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
um and and to so there's this notion

450
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
that the police and the government needs

451
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,120
to crack down

452
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
on encryption

453
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,480
um not because crimes are being

454
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
committed online actually it's it's got

455
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
this interesting offline component and

456
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,440
also that that um they are behind that

457
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
the government has fallen behind and has

458
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
allowed these technologies like

459
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
encryption to overtake

460
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
um the you know the country and and now

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,280
it's like a place where thieves are

462
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
organizing it's a really interesting

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,880
narrative because it kind of cuts into

464
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
this idea that um

465
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
encryption is critical for cyber

466
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
security and for keeping you safe online

467
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
it gives this really offline component

468
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
so what's happened there is also

469
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,839
happened previously in india and brazil

470
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,599
they've suggested something called

471
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
traceability so they don't want they're

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,120
not asking for the content of

473
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,679
the messages what the police are asking

474
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,160
for is the ability to trace messages on

475
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
the platform where they came from so um

476
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
implicit in that of course and many

477
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
people didn't point this out at first

478
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
but is that the police probably already

479
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,320
have the message in question maybe

480
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
somebody's forwarded it to them they've

481
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
come to the police station they've shown

482
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
them the message so they probably have

483
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
it but now what they want platforms to

484
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,720
help them do is to help trace who's seen

485
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,520
it

486
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
where it's come from and it sounds like

487
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
it doesn't break encryption but of

488
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
course anybody who's designed an

489
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
end-to-end encrypted messaging app knows

490
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
that it certainly would weaken the

491
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,480
entire platform and it creates a massive

492
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
amount of metadata

493
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
that would have to be stored and handed

494
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
over anyway so it's a bit of a mess but

495
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,120
actually it was passed in bangladesh

496
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
very recently in the last couple of

497
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
months and it was passed in india last

498
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
year a similar proposal was in

499
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
was was

500
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,240
suggested in brazil and i believe it's

501
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,039
still

502
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,640
possible and on the table but it hasn't

503
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,559
been passed and as far as i know there's

504
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
no update to that so that's once that's

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
on trace something called traceability

506
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
um this is another one um in the global

507
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
south it's in it happened in ethiopia

508
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
quite a while ago actually and i bring

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
it up because um

510
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
it's it's not again a direct policy

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
threat but it shows you kind of what

512
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,200
happens um when

513
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
encryption is used in authoritarian

514
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
government so

515
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
ethiopia 2014

516
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
these folks are called the

517
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,160
um zone nine bloggers um and they did um

518
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
a workshop probably with

519
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
um a western

520
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
ngo about how to use encryption i think

521
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
it was email encryption because pgp is a

522
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,559
little hard um

523
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
and they were all arrested

524
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
right after that or during the workshop

525
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
and some of them didn't get out um for

526
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
years

527
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
and the they really ultimately were

528
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
probably put in jail because they were

529
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,559
blogging

530
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,760
about things the government didn't want

531
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
them to blog about but the point is is

532
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,200
that they

533
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,919
were seen as kind of spies i think

534
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,200
they're

535
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,039
actually the the charges against them

536
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
include like proof of espionage

537
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,559
activities because they took this

538
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,280
encryption workshop

539
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
and so and this has actually happened in

540
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
other places as well other countries

541
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,480
have put in place regulation such that

542
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
implementers of indian encryption won't

543
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
even roll their services out um and it

544
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,679
is more of an authoritarian approach

545
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
just even the idea of it right um and

546
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,039
and so back in 2014 you can maybe see

547
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,600
that now today i think it's harder to

548
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
imagine that you could just ban outright

549
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
the use of of encryption considering how

550
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,039
ubiquitous it is um but i do think that

551
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,919
that

552
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
sort of perception is still

553
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
important to remember

554
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,760
and that when you make tools and you

555
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
assume people are going to use them in

556
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
repressive regimes it actually can put

557
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,080
them at risk more

558
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,840
and that isn't necessarily going to go

559
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,559
fully away so i just want to plant that

560
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,240
story in your mind

561
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,360
um then my third story is about zimbabwe

562
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,280
so this is back when mugabe was still

563
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,760
president the economy was tanking and

564
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
people were in the streets and they were

565
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,919
trying to shut down

566
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,000
mugabe's government because of how messy

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,679
it was and this was circulating

568
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
everywhere so this is also back in this

569
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
is 2016.

570
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,039
i don't know if you all remember the

571
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
news also in that year in 2016 is when

572
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
whatsapp encrypted

573
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
um i believe so the so what they were

574
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,000
within a couple months of each other so

575
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,919
i remember getting i was working for an

576
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,919
organization based in johannesburg at

577
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,600
the time i was getting messages from

578
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,159
people in zimbabwe that were concerned

579
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,919
that the government actually could read

580
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,919
their messages they they were using

581
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,480
whatsapp because well everybody uses

582
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
whatsapp there um it's like 50

583
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,600
of the internet is whatsapp basically um

584
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
but also they were using it to organize

585
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
because they were told it had just been

586
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,039
encrypted and it was safe but then the

587
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,559
government was saying we can see what

588
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
you're writing and if you write anything

589
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
of this nature we're going to throw you

590
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
in jail and they were rather quite

591
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
serious but they were but so there was

592
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,320
some question and those that that sort

593
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
of time period there was some

594
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,080
uncertainty about whether or not that

595
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
was true could

596
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
mugabe actually get whatsapp messages i

597
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,360
mean he couldn't but he scared people

598
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
enough um that they that they thought he

599
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
might be able to um

600
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
this um is also a really important one

601
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
because since

602
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,159
um mugabe is out now but they there

603
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
still tends to be um shut down so when

604
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,120
they couldn't um stop people from using

605
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
whatsapp they just shut it down

606
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
um which is a problem when most people

607
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
in the country consider that to be their

608
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,600
internet right um and so you know when

609
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,159
there's a crisis the the economy is

610
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,520
terrible there are protests in the

611
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
street you cannot

612
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,559
contact your loved one to see how

613
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,200
they're doing you can't now access the

614
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
news you can't make financial

615
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
transactions it's like

616
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
it's quite a big deal so another sort of

617
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,280
word of caution is when um

618
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
sufficiently motivated authoritarians

619
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
are afraid enough of of encryption and

620
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,200
things like that they will do something

621
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
perhaps more drastic like just shut down

622
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,400
the entire service

623
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
um so

624
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
i guess in the end too i want to just

625
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
make a final note um

626
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,000
about

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,640
also what's happening in in the u.s and

628
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
europe i saved it to the end i don't

629
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
actually have much to say about it other

630
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,880
than it is under attack through

631
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,559
legislation in the us called the earn it

632
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,000
act in the eu there is a proposed

633
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
action around child safety that that

634
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,679
puts

635
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,240
encryption at risk and the problem

636
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,760
obviously with those other than the fact

637
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
that they break encryption is that it

638
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,480
will if they are um if they are

639
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,600
successful enable a lot of

640
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,640
bad governments and bad um actors to now

641
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
imagine that they too can have that same

642
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
access we talk a lot about lawful access

643
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
as if a court

644
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
can can grant

645
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
the right people

646
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,440
the right access to the to the right

647
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
targets to get the information they need

648
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
for their

649
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
ongoing investigations their court

650
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
evidence a variety of different reasons

651
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,919
right but the any of those measures that

652
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,919
we make will have to

653
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,240
pass the test of proportionality simply

654
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
because of some of the examples i've

655
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
explained here because there will be now

656
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
governments who can imagine that in fact

657
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,960
end-to-end encryption is compatible with

658
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,559
certain kinds of access and i think we

659
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,279
need to remember to always say

660
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,640
very loud that it is not in fact at all

661
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
compatible

662
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
so the i don't imagine that this is

663
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,520
going to be something we overcome and

664
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,279
then it's fine it's always going to be

665
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
an issue and so that's why we have the

666
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
global encryption coalition because um

667
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
you know copycat regulation as we've

668
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
seen one country does something and then

669
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,960
other countries do it too

670
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,039
and also even if we had good laws on the

671
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
books those can always be undone um but

672
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
the good news is so can the bad laws

673
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
yeah that are already out there so i

674
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,799
think we have a few strategies we have

675
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,600
to um sort of contain the narratives we

676
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
have to offer alternative narratives

677
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
right it's not about protecting children

678
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
by breaking encryption it's about

679
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
protecting children by making encryption

680
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,279
ubiquitous

681
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,679
and protecting them too um the another

682
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,600
one is that we need to make sure we're

683
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
watching in our peripheral vision um

684
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
other policies that might have

685
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,880
implications

686
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
on um end-to-end encrypted systems and

687
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,159
then lastly we have to not forget that

688
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,919
there are some major civil liberties um

689
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
issues at stake when we look at things

690
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
like compelled decryption which seems

691
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
like a good narrow idea but has actually

692
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,600
um

693
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
bigger problems than just

694
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,520
you know does it break iphone encryption

695
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
or whatever and then also client-side

696
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
scanning which is not something i talked

697
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
about in depth here but the idea that

698
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
you can then offload some of this

699
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,080
computing to devices and treat a device

700
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,159
like an endpoint rather than a person

701
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,159
has major civil liberties implications

702
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,559
that we also can't let go

703
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,520
um

704
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
so those are the three strategies going

705
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
forward and i think a sub strategy

706
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
perhaps under the first one

707
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
when we need to shift the narrative is

708
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,279
also like i ended with

709
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,360
previously that you know we need to have

710
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
clear definitions of what intent

711
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
encryption is or one of the tactics

712
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,679
we've seen is to actually just erode the

713
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,320
whole notion of what encryption means at

714
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
all where you have folks saying no it's

715
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
perfectly fine you can have access

716
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
and you can have encryption at the same

717
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
time and that's just not true but it's

718
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,960
easy to say when it's not clear what we

719
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
mean when we say encryption

720
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
anyway that's my talk i hope i have some

721
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,360
time for questions but i think i ran out

722
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
sorry

723
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,279
okay so if people like to come up to the

724
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,080
mic

725
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
um whilst they're coming up to mike

726
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,679
we've got a question on zulip which i've

727
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,080
got my right glasses on says um uh could

728
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
you say a few more words about the

729
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
threat of intellectual property law to

730
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
encryption uh do you have uh maybe some

731
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
examples of it at the policy level

732
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,039
that's from alexandre yamayako

733
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,240
i don't have any examples off

734
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
the top of my head because i think

735
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
they've if they've been proposed in the

736
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,559
past they've been largely unpopular

737
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,840
whereas the

738
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,240
you know terrorism terrorist content or

739
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,200
um

740
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
child sexual abuse material like has a

741
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,200
little bit more of a grip um in the

742
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
public imagination but but it is to say

743
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
that the proposals we've seen to solve

744
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,960
say the csam problem would be very easy

745
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
to apply to the intellectual property

746
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,039
problem where you hash content for

747
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,559
example that is um you know ip and you

748
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
can find it very easily online then and

749
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
take it down and take down the people

750
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
who are distributing it with you and

751
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,600
anyway so that's all that's the reason i

752
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
included it there is that in at least in

753
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,000
the past that was a big motivator for um

754
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
getting it encrypted content

755
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,240
uh

756
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
has there been any discussion on

757
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,840
anti-censorship with web3

758
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,679
applications um

759
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,200
can you tell me more about what you mean

760
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
by web3 applications so kind of

761
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,840
distributed on the blockchain um you

762
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,880
know using that to bypass the ability of

763
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,559
uh for example for governments to shut

764
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,520
down say what's up

765
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
okay well

766
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
i i don't know you you what's up in the

767
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
end at the end there and i don't know

768
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,120
what to do about that but i would say so

769
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
when i was at my last position i worked

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
for article 19 which is a freedom of

771
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,480
expression

772
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
charity based in the uk and we did talk

773
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,679
about um

774
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
distributed ledgers and

775
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,640
the censorship problem because for us at

776
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
least in europe it's a little bit

777
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,799
different in the us there is um there

778
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,240
are some

779
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
um good reasons to to take content down

780
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,159
um and so that presents that problem

781
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,679
right so when you sort of solve that

782
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,600
problem where gee actually you should

783
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,240
there are some things you don't want

784
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
forever

785
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,440
you know you have to thread that needle

786
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,279
um i do and i don't necessarily think

787
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,360
that that is um intense encryption in

788
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
the confidentiality sense so it's a

789
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,320
little bit out of scope of what we're

790
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
talking about now but i would encourage

791
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
you to read

792
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,360
that paper probably do it find it on a

793
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,559
web search yeah thank you

794
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,399
thank you thank you for a great talk um

795
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,840
you mentioned some some ways forward i

796
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,640
guess

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
do you have some concrete tips what we

798
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
as cryptographers researchers engineers

799
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,200
what we can concretely do to help

800
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
achieve the goals you mentioned

801
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
yeah this is a great question so um some

802
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,320
of you already are you're helping um to

803
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,080
inform the policy debate and to talk to

804
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,640
um ngos that are working with at-risk

805
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,240
groups on the ground and so on so keep

806
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,399
doing that i would say that for

807
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,760
implementers it's important to

808
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
understand what are the risks so

809
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,039
and and i think alternatively um for

810
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,880
those of us trying to make good laws or

811
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,559
proactive laws it's good for us to also

812
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,840
be in touch with you so that we

813
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
understand what your constraints are why

814
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,840
you might for example not want to

815
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,799
implement

816
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,440
um you know in indian encryption in a

817
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,600
country that you know defines

818
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,760
key length for example or whatever right

819
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,840
it's it's useful to know so i think it's

820
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
we could we should keep you should keep

821
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,159
up with the news on it you should follow

822
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,240
groups um like those that are involved

823
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
in the global encryption coalition um

824
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,960
and and yeah i think that's just really

825
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,320
the keeping the service area between um

826
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,559
technical folks and policy folks is just

827
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,919
always important but it's especially

828
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
important in encryption policy

829
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,039
thank you very much

830
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
thank you for your talk it was very nice

831
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,279
uh i'm just wondering like one thing i

832
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,720
haven't heard that much about in the

833
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,320
news and i'm also hurting

834
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,399
hoping for your opinion on this is like

835
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,080
a compromise between full end to end

836
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,039
encryption and say a backdoor in an

837
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,960
escrow mechanism like use threshold

838
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,360
cryptography where

839
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
you could selectively open specific

840
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
messages only if a quorum of the

841
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
different organizations or ngos agree

842
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
yes we have evaluated a bunch of these

843
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
different proposals there was um

844
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
last year the european commission had

845
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,080
assembled a group of experts to look at

846
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
possible ways to solve content

847
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,399
moderation and intent encryption they

848
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
put forward i think like 13 proposals

849
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
some of them including like plain text

850
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,360
but we evaluated those and we found that

851
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,039
none of them are satisfactory and i

852
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,399
would say that

853
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,799
in the case of escrow

854
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,279
what you really are dealing with though

855
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
is authority central authority that has

856
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,720
that control and even if um you sort of

857
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,519
use computation right say like there are

858
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,320
authorities like nick mc which is an

859
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
established authority that keeps a hash

860
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
database right you have all these like

861
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
really um

862
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
trusted parties handling the hard

863
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,240
decisions but then you use any kind of

864
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,320
automation or you use any kind of tool

865
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
to make that a little bit faster and

866
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,159
work at scale the problem is you have

867
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
human review right so if you're taking

868
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
down content you need to actually check

869
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,159
that you're you know you're taking down

870
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,760
the content you bring a human into the

871
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
loop and the promise of confidentiality

872
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,679
is gone or um

873
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,240
you know we've proposed for example one

874
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,320
that wouldn't be so terrible is user

875
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,600
reporting so that you know people that

876
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,840
don't want to be sent garbage on into

877
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,519
encrypted messaging that's good like

878
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,440
it's a user-centric approach but then

879
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
once messages are reported you have to

880
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,279
check them for abuse so they're not

881
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,559
abusing the platform and trying to

882
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
censor someone else and so that requires

883
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,080
a lot of care and thought into how to

884
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,840
action it how to follow up if it's

885
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,240
you know not turns out to be a violation

886
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,159
that sort of thing so i would say that

887
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,399
all of those problems are inherent in it

888
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,480
in the key escrow problem as well in

889
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
addition to the main one which is that

890
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
do you trust the people who make the

891
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,919
decision and that's one that i'm not

892
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,200
sure i would even agree is solved so all

893
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,320
right thank you

894
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
okay so we have two more questions but

895
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
make them short questions and short

896
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,399
answers okay i i struggle with concision

897
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,399
and precision but i will try to do both

898
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,480
um it seems to me this this whole

899
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,080
subject kind of strikes at the heart of

900
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,440
questions about like

901
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,679
what even should states be allowed to do

902
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,720
or not

903
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,440
but i'm a democrat like a democracy has

904
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
a fundamental value i don't want to live

905
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,080
in a technocracy even though my values i

906
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,399
share your love of civil liberties but

907
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,399
what happens not in an authoritarian

908
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,799
state but in a democratic state when it

909
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,760
is the democratic will of the populace

910
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
that they wish to make a different

911
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
exchange between civil liberties and

912
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
securities than the one you're proposing

913
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,120
because

914
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,840
i

915
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,080
i don't think my values should override

916
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
democracy

917
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,159
but i have my values how do we address

918
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,720
that paradox without just being one

919
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
source of many values in a in a

920
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,159
democratic world

921
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
i like this um i really i like the

922
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,480
philosophical part of it i do think

923
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,039
though that in our real lives we have

924
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,159
the right to whisper we can walk outside

925
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,919
maybe near a water fountain and have a

926
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,240
conversation it is very hard to do that

927
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,039
online and just because it's it's just

928
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
because we can potentially um you know

929
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,519
listen in on every conversation that

930
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
goes across the internet doesn't mean we

931
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
should and i think i think actually our

932
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,159
democratic approach to solving some of

933
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,960
these very difficult social issues would

934
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
be a lot

935
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,120
deeper and richer and longer lasting if

936
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,640
we sort of took breaking encryption off

937
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
the table if we just sort of said like

938
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,000
this is the minimum beyond which we will

939
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,879
not go and then worked on top of that to

940
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
address some of these other problems i

941
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,760
actually think that we would come up

942
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
with better solutions but that's just a

943
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,119
suspicion because we haven't tried it

944
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,800
yet so i don't know we're all focused on

945
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,359
like this one particular angle to solve

946
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,280
these problems i feel like we're missing

947
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
a whole lot of other things

948
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,320
hello so one of the

949
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,159
things you mentioned as not really a

950
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,119
threat was uh export controls

951
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,440
i don't think this is the case i know

952
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,918
that for instance well web crypto api

953
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,599
the reason there's no mandatory to

954
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,879
implement

955
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,440
part was due to concerns of vendors

956
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,679
around export controls

957
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
and that's permanently reduced the

958
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
usefulness of that standard and made it

959
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,159
harder to implement to play cryptography

960
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
in the browser yes so the us has

961
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,800
recently relaxed its export controls

962
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
around encryption which is welcome i was

963
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
talking about on a global level export

964
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
controls are used as a way to squeeze

965
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,920
encryption in maybe more authoritarian

966
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
places they use that as like the one

967
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,680
thing they have on the books about

968
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
encryption and it's the place if you

969
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,040
were going to put it anywhere in the in

970
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
the in the law you would put it there so

971
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,960
i agree with you in in most democratic

972
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
countries import export controls not a

973
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,119
real issue but just to say it is a

974
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,760
vector for making it less popular and

975
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,680
for making it harder to obtain and to

976
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
export

977
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,079
cool thank you for those

978
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,920
very lucid answers and thank you for the

979
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,200
talk and a round of applause again

980
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,200
please

981
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,280
[Applause]

982
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,960
so uh next talk in this session um

983
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
whilst the speaker sets up

984
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,320
is all about that data towards a

985
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
practical assessment of attacks on

986
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,200
encrypted search and it's by a multitude

987
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,400
of authors and amos will give the talk

988
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,480
yeah thank you for the introduction this

989
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
talk is based on joint work with cindy

990
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
camara abdel karankarti take more tests

991
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,720
tomorrow schneider and michelle

992
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,480
although any opinions here will be my

993
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,119
own uh and uh yeah this work will also

994
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,680
appear at euro s p this year

995
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
uh it is concerned with the topic of

996
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
encrypted search which is motivated by

997
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,040
the fact that in current applications

998
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,119
the user usually has to give up like her

999
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,200
data as plain text information to a

1000
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,880
service provider or at least a service

1001
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
provider will have plain text access to

1002
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,119
this information so this not only gives

1003
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,760
up her privacy but it also poses a grave

1004
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,079
threat in the case of data breaches

1005
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,520
because

1006
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,280
if a service provider has access to such

1007
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,119
information this information will also

1008
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,160
leak out

1009
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
in a data breach so ideally we would

1010
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,480
want like some encryption mechanism

1011
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,560
where we can encrypt our data give it to

1012
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,119
the service provider server um and then

1013
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,640
like in the case of a data breach this

1014
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
data would be unusable

1015
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,400
but the issue if you just use like

1016
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
well-known encryption techniques is that

1017
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,200
then the data is also

1018
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,440
unusable for the client or the server

1019
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,839
particularly we won't be able anymore

1020
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,359
to

1021
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,599
to index and search this data and for

1022
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,280
that reason researchers as well as

1023
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
industry came up with the topic of

1024
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
encrypted search

1025
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,119
so encrypted search or encrypted search

1026
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,359
algorithms here we have a client that is

1027
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,720
trusted

1028
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
and is in possession of a

1029
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
of a

1030
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,160
secret key sk and the server is in

1031
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,240
possession of an encrypted document or

1032
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,079
data collection d

1033
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,160
and at any point in time the client can

1034
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
issue a query queue which for example

1035
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,800
can be a keyword query like looking for

1036
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
all of the documents that contain their

1037
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,599
keyword crypto but also other

1038
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,599
query types are possible for example

1039
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,520
range search like looking for all of the

1040
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,960
subjects

1041
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,160
um aged 18 to 39 in a numeric data

1042
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,200
collection

1043
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
this query is kind of encrypted into a

1044
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,040
token which is given to the server and

1045
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
the server can compute the result and

1046
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,160
send it back to the

1047
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
to the client and the result contains

1048
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
all encrypted records that satisfy the

1049
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,359
query

1050
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,520
intuitively this is secure because you

1051
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,720
know at each step we are dealing with

1052
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,560
encryptions the token is an encryption

1053
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,359
the data collection is encrypted and the

1054
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,680
result is also encrypted

1055
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,200
and there are also formal models where

1056
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
we can prove the security of an esa

1057
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,400
however most efficient esis possess some

1058
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,440
form of

1059
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,200
information leakage that kind of drips

1060
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,359
down during this whole process this can

1061
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,359
for example be

1062
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,440
the query quality so

1063
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,680
an adversary might know when and how

1064
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,760
a query repeats or the access pattern

1065
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,200
like knowing the identifiers of the

1066
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,880
returned records

1067
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,920
um yeah and for the purpose of this work

1068
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,839
we will look at leakage that is commonly

1069
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,839
associated with esa's built on the

1070
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,599
cryptographic primitive structured

1071
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,839
encryption such as symmetric encryption

1072
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,079
and ws ram

1073
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,760
and because the seekage is so common in

1074
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,079
encrypted search uh cryptanalysis is an

1075
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,400
important uh part of uh of research and

1076
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,560
encrypted search because it allows us to

1077
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
see what kind of information we can get

1078
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,640
from this information that is commonly

1079
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
commonly leaked

1080
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
and to do this the literature has come

1081
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
up with so-called leakage attacks a

1082
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
leakage attack takes an observed leakage

1083
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,280
pattern together with possibly some

1084
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
auxiliary information

1085
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,880
to try and recover the plaintext

1086
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
information so either the query or

1087
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,119
information about the data collection

1088
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,280
and for the purpose of this work we are

1089
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
constraining ourselves to attacks or

1090
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,200
adversaries that are persistent meaning

1091
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
that they get a transcript of the

1092
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,640
interaction between client and server

1093
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,119
but um are also passive meaning they

1094
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,280
don't interact themselves with uh with

1095
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
this process

1096
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,640
so of course if the attacker here is

1097
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
successful and obtains the plaintext

1098
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
information

1099
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,040
this kind of defeats the purpose of the

1100
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,440
security that we would want to have here

1101
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,359
however there's kind of conflicting

1102
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,280
information of how practical

1103
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,400
these attacks are and to see this let's

1104
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,599
take a look at

1105
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
like the

1106
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
papers on encrypted search at top venues

1107
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
at the last year because they are

1108
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,200
depending on if you look at more of a

1109
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
construction paper or more of an attack

1110
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
or counter measures papers

1111
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
you find like different statements about

1112
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,040
the practicality of attacks

1113
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
in a construction paper if the

1114
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
construction possesses some leakage you

1115
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
usually find that like leakage is benign

1116
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
or common or standard or accepted and

1117
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,599
when it comes to attacks that uh that

1118
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
try to exploit this leakage it is said

1119
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
that the attacks are kind of rather

1120
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
theoretical like the

1121
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,200
uh like the attacks um

1122
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,960
like as assume extremely strong out of

1123
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
several models and are unlikely to work

1124
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,880
in practice on the other hand if you

1125
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,480
look more towards attack or construction

1126
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,599
paper or countermeasure papers

1127
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,040
there it is kind of said that the

1128
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
attacks you know pose a severe threat

1129
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,800
are devastating

1130
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
that therefore the schemes are

1131
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,680
vulnerable and

1132
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
should no longer be used without counter

1133
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,839
measures so here you know

1134
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,880
the uh the assumptions are also uh

1135
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
said to be like rather weak and you just

1136
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,520
you require some knowledge in order to

1137
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,800
obtain significant information so here

1138
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,400
the attacks are seen as a counter

1139
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,599
measure to

1140
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,720
security with some practical relevancy

1141
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
but now it's kind of unclear you know

1142
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
what is actually the case

1143
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,119
um

1144
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,200
so i i don't mean to criticize any of

1145
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
these works here i think you can make

1146
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
like you can support these statements

1147
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,960
with the data that is available but i

1148
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,319
also think there's not enough data to

1149
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
kind of settle this discussion of

1150
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,079
practicality and

1151
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,480
you can see this by looking at the way

1152
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,500
previous evolutions have been conducted

1153
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,839
[Music]

1154
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
so rightly saw previous works have been

1155
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,599
focused mainly on making the attacks

1156
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,520
better because of course we want to know

1157
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,119
how much information we can get out of

1158
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,200
leakage but they haven't focused so much

1159
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,520
on making evaluations better

1160
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,119
in bureau's evolutions

1161
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,040
the code has been largely closed source

1162
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
making it very hard to reproduce results

1163
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
and for example different setting or

1164
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,920
different data than what has been used

1165
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,440
and the data and settings that have been

1166
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,920
used we are rather

1167
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
rather restricted so for the case of

1168
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,240
keyword search uh only email data with

1169
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
the well-known android email data set

1170
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,839
has been used and for range search

1171
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,599
mainly hospital data

1172
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,520
for a medical use case has been used

1173
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,560
therefore it's been only a few

1174
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
comparisons for some leakage patterns

1175
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,319
it's not even clear which attack is the

1176
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,599
state of the art

1177
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,680
and also the data that has been used was

1178
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,880
kind of

1179
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,800
a lot of times small or restricted also

1180
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
because the attacks are computationally

1181
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,839
demanding

1182
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,160
but in my opinion most importantly was

1183
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,680
the way the queries have been sampled in

1184
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,599
evaluations so in the leakage that we

1185
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,240
look at here the uh it depends on the

1186
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,520
queries that have been issued in a

1187
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,359
system so if you're doing

1188
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
like empirical evaluation you need some

1189
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,160
queries to attack

1190
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
however it is very hard to find such

1191
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,200
data so they have been modeled

1192
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,560
artificially

1193
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,880
if you take a look here this is like a

1194
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,800
typical distribution of

1195
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,599
keywords in a document collection

1196
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,200
where you follow kind of a law

1197
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,400
distribution so

1198
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,319
there are some low rank keywords that

1199
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
occur very frequently so they occur in a

1200
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,560
lot of documents but most of the

1201
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
keywords occur in just a handful of

1202
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,680
documents so they're in the tail of the

1203
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
distribution and what has been done is

1204
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,839
that they've been like different

1205
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,920
evaluation regimes so you do a high

1206
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
frequency evaluation so you take the

1207
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
keywords from the the lowest rank and

1208
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,440
attack them or you take some keywords

1209
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,599
that have a low frequency from the tail

1210
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,680
of the distribution and attack those

1211
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,760
however there are very different results

1212
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,319
based on which regime you take and

1213
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,400
therefore you know i think both sides of

1214
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,319
the previous argument can be supported

1215
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,319
by this data because it entirely depends

1216
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,400
on your interpretation of how a user

1217
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,800
would query such a system

1218
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
and with our work we wanted to

1219
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,119
move towards like a different evaluation

1220
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,240
where we don't have to make such

1221
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,560
interpretations

1222
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,400
so in this work we

1223
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,160
we first introduced an open source

1224
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,359
framework

1225
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,480
which includes a lot of attack

1226
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,800
implementations and we also

1227
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,440
look at very different new data sources

1228
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,680
that cover a lot of different use cases

1229
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,280
and we do this to perform a systematic

1230
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,359
re-evaluation of known attacks so kind

1231
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,200
of an soc style work

1232
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,119
which also includes much larger data

1233
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,480
than what has been previously considered

1234
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,079
but most importantly we are the first to

1235
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,440
found

1236
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,920
and used uh real world query logs so we

1237
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,160
have actual data of real users issuing

1238
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,240
real queries in real systems and

1239
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,640
therefore as much we don't don't have to

1240
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
rely on any interpretation of

1241
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,599
how this how a user would query such a

1242
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,520
system and therefore i think we can make

1243
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,200
a bit more practical uh statement about

1244
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
you know non-leakage attacks on

1245
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,359
encrypted search

1246
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,880
our new software is called leaker and it

1247
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,359
contains a re-implementation of 17 major

1248
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,520
leakage attacks against encrypted search

1249
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,800
and this is an open source framework

1250
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,119
written in python that is available on

1251
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,800
github

1252
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,240
and our goal with this framework is

1253
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,000
really that it also benefits the

1254
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,240
community we wanted to make it very easy

1255
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,920
to implement new attacks

1256
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,839
or also new counter measures which is

1257
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,079
why we try to stick to a very modular

1258
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,560
design that is also interoperable so if

1259
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,000
you have a new attack a new

1260
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,079
countermeasure and even just some new

1261
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,480
data that might be very interesting uh

1262
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,560
it should be very easy to to use and run

1263
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,319
evaluations on this and i hope we can

1264
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,480
get some further contributions for with

1265
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
this framework

1266
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,200
in order to continually get a better

1267
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,319
understanding

1268
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,280
of leakage attacks

1269
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,319
our new data covers several use cases

1270
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,000
for the case of keyword search or point

1271
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,599
queries we found or we used data google

1272
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,119
data so

1273
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,040
gmail for

1274
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,800
for an email search case or google drive

1275
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,440
for cloud research case

1276
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,960
in these cases we gave some willing

1277
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,680
participants predefined leaker scripts

1278
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,920
so they could locally on their machines

1279
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
run evaluations on their google search

1280
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,280
queries

1281
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,440
and data collections and they just gave

1282
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,680
us back the results of the accuracy of

1283
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,800
the attacks

1284
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,640
for web search we have found an aol

1285
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,640
query log and for genetic search we use

1286
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,200
the tear query log which is a

1287
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,800
aquarius on the system for genetic

1288
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
research

1289
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,319
for the case of range search we have

1290
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,240
also multiple use cases

1291
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,160
we use the slow individual sky story or

1292
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,920
sdss query log

1293
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,760
to cover a scientific use case because

1294
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,240
this concerns astronomical data we use

1295
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,000
mimic data for hospital

1296
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,599
for hospital use case

1297
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,210
data from the uk government for

1298
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,720
[Music]

1299
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,599
for salary data sales data from walmart

1300
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:26,880
and insurance data from the new york

1301
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,040
city department of transportation

1302
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,440
of these nine data sources the first

1303
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,359
five have actual query logs for the

1304
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,599
letter four we had to rely on kind of

1305
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,000
repurposing the previous query logs

1306
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
into like a new artificial distribution

1307
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,440
in order to cover a variety of data

1308
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,480
settings and data distributions

1309
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,079
so with this with the software and the

1310
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,040
data we are in a position to perform our

1311
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,880
systematic re-evaluation of non-leakage

1312
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,920
attacks

1313
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
like all attacks on all data and we

1314
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
uncovered a lot of interesting results

1315
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,839
where a text performed worse than

1316
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,920
expected or better than expected i don't

1317
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,599
have the time here to

1318
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,079
go into all of the details however um i

1319
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,760
will show like a brief summary and also

1320
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,640
one highlight

1321
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,119
so in summary for the keyboard search

1322
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,800
if the leakage

1323
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,960
pertains to the response length or the

1324
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,040
response volume or also co-occurrence

1325
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,200
information the non-attacks

1326
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,280
worse than what is expected

1327
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,040
they required a lot of adversarial

1328
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,760
knowledge in order to work so here our

1329
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,680
risk assessment which is

1330
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,920
which is of course um subjective is that

1331
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,559
this is low risk and by risk we kind of

1332
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
mean you know the probability that if

1333
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,800
the system were deployed and the leakage

1334
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
observed that

1335
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,040
that an adversary or attacker would

1336
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,640
uncover significant

1337
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,400
uh a significant fraction of the queries

1338
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,480
correctly

1339
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,400
um for the case of leakage about the

1340
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,640
individual documents the attacks work

1341
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,240
much better than expected so we consider

1342
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,160
them high risk and also think that this

1343
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,960
leakage should be suppressed in systems

1344
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,880
and this is also the so the result i

1345
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,200
want to highlight and it corresponds to

1346
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,319
the subgraph attacks of black stony dion

1347
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,839
for this kind of attacks there were

1348
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,359
there was an expectation that in a real

1349
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,240
system the uh the queries of a user

1350
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,000
would be so specific that the attacks

1351
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,160
would fail to work uh so actually these

1352
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,000
were two expectations the first is that

1353
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,520
based on the previous evaluations on the

1354
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,319
enron email data set and the

1355
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,760
attacks didn't really work against low

1356
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,559
frequency keywords uh so you know

1357
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,160
keywords that just return a handful of

1358
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,920
documents and there the attacks didn't

1359
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,280
really work

1360
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,960
and the second expectation is that in a

1361
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
real system it would kind of be kind of

1362
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
intuitive that a user would craft a

1363
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
query such that it only returns

1364
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,880
not a lot of results like you would

1365
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,200
maybe search for a very specific email

1366
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
however with our data we showed that at

1367
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,359
least you know on our data both of these

1368
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,559
expectations are not supported

1369
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,400
for example we took the least frequent

1370
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,720
keywords in the the this tear query lock

1371
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,640
that we have and you know ran the

1372
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,480
evaluation here the mean frequency is

1373
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,680
just 1.54 but as you can see here the

1374
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,359
subgraph identifier attack works much

1375
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,359
better than what has been expected and

1376
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,200
it even still returns a fourth of the

1377
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,880
crevice correctly

1378
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,920
with just 10 knowledge of the data

1379
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,720
and

1380
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
similarly for the expectation that users

1381
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
would craft low frequency queries and

1382
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,960
this is also not the case on our data so

1383
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,119
even on the very small private gmail

1384
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,960
data the mean frequency of the issued

1385
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,160
queries was 326 which is rather high and

1386
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,599
you can also see here with the red and

1387
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,920
green points that the attack works

1388
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,599
really well uh

1389
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,960
we're still correctly uncovering about

1390
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
half of the queries correctly with just

1391
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,720
five percent knowledge of the data which

1392
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,480
i think is realistic for email data

1393
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
because you it contains things like

1394
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,800
newsletters and spam that are kind of

1395
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,839
public information

1396
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,200
uh yes so for the case of um of range

1397
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,960
search we didn't have such a you know

1398
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,720
strong highlight rather a lot of nuances

1399
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
about the different attacks so for

1400
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,400
response length information no attack

1401
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,240
really worked on all data so we would

1402
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,079
say this is very low risk which again is

1403
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,079
a subjective measure

1404
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,839
if also query equality or correct

1405
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,160
information is leaked then the attack

1406
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,240
saw some success depending on the

1407
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,559
data distribution so here is a kind of

1408
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,680
medium risk

1409
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,760
and uh if also crocodiles and order

1410
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,119
informations leaked then we had

1411
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,760
consistent uh consistently good results

1412
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,680
of the attacks and we said this is high

1413
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,040
risk

1414
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
and so it remains open to also

1415
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,000
look at how to suppress such leakage for

1416
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,760
encrypted range search schemes

1417
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,640
so in conclusion we present this

1418
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,800
extensible open source framework called

1419
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,040
leaker for leakage attack evaluations

1420
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,880
and we are the first to have identified

1421
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
and used real-world query logs and

1422
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,960
leakage script analysis

1423
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,200
in this kind of systematic revelation

1424
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,960
and empirical analysis

1425
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,559
of leakage attack against encrypted

1426
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,480
search and there we found some

1427
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,640
interesting results that also contradict

1428
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,359
some previous uh conclusions

1429
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,280
uh yeah however you know we were still

1430
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
constrained to just a handful of query

1431
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,760
locks

1432
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,920
so i think you know with these three

1433
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
question marks i showed in the beginning

1434
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,520
i think we maybe removed one of the

1435
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
question marks here uh there's still a

1436
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,000
lot of work to be done so while this was

1437
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,760
a tough hill to climb with all of these

1438
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,599
revelations with the framework we're

1439
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,359
finding all of this data there's still a

1440
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,200
mountain of research i had to be done to

1441
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,520
come to a truly practical assessment of

1442
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,440
a text on encrypted search

1443
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,119
however i think we've exhausted all of

1444
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,359
our options as like researchers with all

1445
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,400
of with the data that is available to us

1446
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,559
so uh what i think needs to be done is

1447
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,720
something that um

1448
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,160
that i've also seen in the information

1449
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,280
retrieval community when looking at

1450
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,960
you know how they deal with query logs

1451
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,720
or query log analysis

1452
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,319
because here they work together with

1453
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,400
industry on proprietary query logs and

1454
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,800
to do analysis so what i think could be

1455
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,880
done here is like we as researchers

1456
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,599
could for example do some legal scripts

1457
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,880
as we did in the

1458
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,800
google evaluation and give this to an

1459
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,400
industry partner with access to

1460
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,319
proprietary grow logs who can then

1461
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,559
locally run this again without violating

1462
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,280
any privacy of any subject and then give

1463
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,760
us back the results and i think with a

1464
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,920
much better databases like this we could

1465
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,000
arrive at a also much better practical

1466
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,839
assessment of attacks on encrypted

1467
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,079
search and therefore also you know

1468
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,000
adequately address this issue

1469
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,079
of uh leakage in encrypted search

1470
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,359
and with that i thank you for your

1471
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,720
attention and i'm happy to take

1472
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
questions

1473
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,160
do we have any questions

1474
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,879
in the audience

1475
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
stirring

1476
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,800
thank you very much for the very nice

1477
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,599
talk

1478
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,160
um

1479
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
simple question so you talk about risk

1480
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,720
in terms of just the probability things

1481
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,960
happen so

1482
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,800
you might also wonder like something is

1483
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,559
very unlikely and

1484
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,880
but nobody cares and there's something

1485
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,119
unlikely it's really

1486
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,480
immense

1487
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,800
so have you tried to factor in some kind

1488
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,760
of weighted risk or is it standard that

1489
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,760
i just don't know because i'm

1490
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,960
not quite yet into the community so this

1491
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
this risk assessment here is like you

1492
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,800
know for the purpose of summary we

1493
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,359
didn't really do any numerical analysis

1494
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,800
in that regard uh as many just like you

1495
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,280
know one one word summary of what we've

1496
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,160
sound

1497
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,599
as in like

1498
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,920
as an intuition uh so we used like we

1499
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,559
say if more than 15 of queries have been

1500
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,559
correctly recovered this is like really

1501
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,800
significant and consistent information

1502
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,559
of course you could adjust the two five

1503
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,880
percent one percent or something and

1504
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
then you know come up with a new kind of

1505
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
risk assessment but that's basically all

1506
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,640
i mean with risk assessment in that

1507
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,599
regard

1508
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,760
okay thanks

1509
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,559
okay

1510
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,599
let's thank the speaker again

1511
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,240
[Applause]

1512
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,720
so our i think it's the final talk of

1513
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,079
the session

1514
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,640
is on

1515
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,559
just make sure the slides are working

1516
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,640
it's all is going to be on a privacy

1517
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,240
attack on the swiss post e-voting system

1518
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,880
uh we've got three authors and alexander

1519
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,520
is going to give the presentation

1520
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,119
okay so thank you so yeah today i will

1521
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,640
talk about uh

1522
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,319
we present you a privacy attack who

1523
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,920
discovered against the

1524
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,640
swiss post system for evotic fight

1525
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,920
voting

1526
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,640
so

1527
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,839
this is a joint work with joining

1528
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,079
in france

1529
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,240
so first i will just start with a brief

1530
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,720
story of evoting in switzerland so

1531
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,200
the first mention of evoting

1532
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,760
is in 2000 when the chancellor decided

1533
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,520
to launch a project about electronic

1534
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,720
voting

1535
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,119
and this project lead to a revision of

1536
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,839
the law in 2003

1537
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,520
to

1538
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,440
start trials for

1539
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,280
evoting in

1540
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,319
federal elections

1541
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
since then

1542
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,680
evolving has been

1543
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,839
continuously adopted

1544
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,559
by more and more cantons

1545
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,839
and

1546
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,760
the an important date is 2017 when

1547
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,960
half of the

1548
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,559
voters in

1549
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,160
switzerland were able to vote online

1550
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,240
in federal elections

1551
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,599
the problem

1552
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,200
came in 2019 when the chancellor decided

1553
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,280
to release

1554
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,960
the source code and the specification of

1555
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,000
the system

1556
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,480
and that attack had been found and

1557
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,559
chancellor decided to stop

1558
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,000
evoting in all direction until

1559
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,119
further

1560
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,599
developments and so on

1561
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,880
so to prevent

1562
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,480
such situations in the future the

1563
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,960
chancellor decided to

1564
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,520
to build a strategy to avoid the attacks

1565
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,200
and detect attacks

1566
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,799
in advance

1567
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,079
and the strategy mainly

1568
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,079
rise into these two points so the first

1569
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,200
one is to

1570
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,839
discuss with experts to precisely define

1571
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,359
what the system must achieve to require

1572
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,480
formal proofs and to

1573
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,359
to do

1574
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,359
audit of the system

1575
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,599
and just the interesting point is that

1576
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,799
the

1577
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,640
characteri very precisely defines the

1578
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,559
trust model and they require in the law

1579
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,680
that

1580
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,000
that the system must be proved secure

1581
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
formally

1582
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,880
and the second

1583
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,119
strategy is to

1584
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,319
release all the code in the

1585
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,240
end end the specification and

1586
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,640
entertain

1587
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,200
all the users and all the experts to to

1588
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,680
audit the code to

1589
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,280
to participate to intrusion tests or

1590
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,920
also to require that the companies

1591
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,839
implement a bug bounty program to

1592
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,040
institute

1593
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,480
users to to find bugs

1594
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,440
so it's in this and the main target

1595
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,079
for the chancellorist was to reintroduce

1596
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,400
e-wroting in the next federal election

1597
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,680
in september this year so it will be

1598
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,440
it will come quite

1599
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,040
quite soon

1600
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,200
so in this context that

1601
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,480
swissport so

1602
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,559
public company in switzerland decided to

1603
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:45,839
buy the

1604
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,200
cycle solution in 2020

1605
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,599
[Music]

1606
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,960
to

1607
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,119
contribute to the reintroduction of

1608
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,119
evoting in suzanne

1609
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,160
so they first fixed all the

1610
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,799
non-vulnerabilities of the seitar

1611
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,480
solutions they improved the code the

1612
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,920
specification

1613
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,720
they made all this stuff public

1614
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,799
and to

1615
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,119
satisfy the requirements of the society

1616
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,200
they need to update all the symbols

1617
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
proof of the system and it is in this

1618
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
context that we've been contacted by by

1619
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,240
the company to do this proof

1620
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,640
and unfortunately when we did this proof

1621
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,359
we discovered a new attack against vote

1622
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,960
secrecy

1623
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,760
and

1624
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,000
the attack

1625
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,240
allowed us to to recover

1626
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,160
the vote of all the voters

1627
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,960
and this is what i will present now

1628
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,280
so first i'll start with just a

1629
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,520
big overview of the of the system i will

1630
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,280
not uh

1631
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,799
present the cryptographic details so

1632
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,280
we'll just give you a flavor of

1633
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,000
how the protocol evolves

1634
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,880
so

1635
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,280
first we have three components the setup

1636
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,200
components four control components of

1637
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,280
the voting server who all together

1638
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,599
generate some cryptographic

1639
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,640
material during the setup phase of the

1640
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,839
before the

1641
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,760
beginning of the election

1642
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,280
so the general sort of cryptographic

1643
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,079
material and at the end the setup

1644
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,319
component just print a paper ballot and

1645
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,200
send it to the to all the voters

1646
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,180
so they send it by postal mail

1647
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,640
[Music]

1648
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,799
and then after the beginning of the

1649
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,839
election when the voter wants to to vote

1650
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,760
you just send an encrypted ballot to the

1651
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,160
server the server broadcasts this

1652
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,599
encrypted ballot to all the control

1653
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,799
components

1654
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,960
and all together they compute

1655
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,680
a written code

1656
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,160
at this step the voter

1657
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,319
checks that the return code occurs onto

1658
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,160
the paper parrot

1659
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,280
and

1660
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,920
if it if the written code occurs appear

1661
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,160
occurs on the paper pilot then he

1662
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,359
confirmed that the vote is correct and

1663
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,520
they want the the vote the ballot is

1664
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,760
confirmed and the ballot will be counted

1665
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,200
during the

1666
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,640
during the decryption during the

1667
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,440
telephase of the election

1668
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,119
so all the voters

1669
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,400
vote

1670
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,799
and at the end

1671
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,359
we will have to to do the tally to sort

1672
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,200
of decrypt of the ballots

1673
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,720
and to improve

1674
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,640
the security

1675
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,760
the

1676
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,240
chancellor requires that the time is

1677
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,440
performed by

1678
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,359
four control components for mixing

1679
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,359
control components

1680
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,920
each of them

1681
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,359
own

1682
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,280
a part of the decryption key so there's

1683
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,599
three green and

1684
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,920
and the yellow one

1685
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,720
and we have an editor to

1686
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,520
to check proof

1687
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,720
so

1688
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,559
when the tally starts

1689
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,799
the voting server

1690
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,720
gather all the

1691
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,960
confirmed ballots they put it in the

1692
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,520
metallic box and send this back back to

1693
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,839
the first control component

1694
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,160
the control components

1695
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,960
mix this electronic box and apply a

1696
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,480
partial decryption

1697
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,119
and generate a proof or certificate

1698
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,200
and send it to the editor the

1699
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,280
main purpose of the proof is just to to

1700
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
ensure that the mixing and the

1701
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,960
decryption have been computed correctly

1702
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,079
the second one and the third component

1703
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,760
applies the same algorithm so mixing and

1704
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,079
decryption and at this step the auditor

1705
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,200
must

1706
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,680
verify that all the proofs are valid

1707
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,000
and if all the proofs are valid

1708
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,359
you can reveal

1709
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,680
the last part of the key to the last

1710
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,760
component and the last component

1711
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,079
mix the clip and publish the

1712
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,599
the final decryption

1713
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,839
so the plain text observance

1714
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,240
and we have the result of the election

1715
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,559
so this is how the

1716
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,319
the protocol is described in the

1717
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,119
specification and

1718
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,680
how the protocol has been studied so far

1719
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,520
but if we

1720
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,240
look at how this protocol is implemented

1721
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,839
in practice

1722
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,160
we'll have one ballot box for each city

1723
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,240
so for example we have the gray one for

1724
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,599
zurich

1725
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,079
the blue one for ben and let's say

1726
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,480
and the last one for follusam and the

1727
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,720
main

1728
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,960
element here is that the decryption

1729
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,119
trust the mixing component control

1730
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,240
component

1731
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,039
will

1732
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,359
receive a stream of electronic blackbox

1733
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,160
and they will apply the decryption

1734
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,440
step by step

1735
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,280
for all these electronic ballot box

1736
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,520
so this is how the

1737
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,880
the protocol

1738
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,640
is defined and how it's implemented

1739
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,640
in the current version of the of the

1740
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,839
code

1741
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,280
and uh before presenting the attack i

1742
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,119
just need to

1743
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,960
to define

1744
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,359
what to consider by voting secrecy so

1745
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,839
very importantly because we we want to

1746
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,160
to prevent an attacker to to learn the

1747
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,640
vote of of a water and what is

1748
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,000
interesting in switzerland is that the

1749
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,359
chancellory uh

1750
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,680
very precisely defined all the security

1751
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,200
requirements so all the trust

1752
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,520
assumptions that

1753
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,200
that we can do to make an attack

1754
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,000
uh so the first element is that

1755
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,480
the system can rely on

1756
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,200
on the auditor on on a judge to verify

1757
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,280
all the proofs so this is accepted by

1758
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,960
chancellori

1759
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,079
and

1760
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,559
the second element is that the system

1761
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,960
must provide vote secrecy

1762
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,920
if only one system so one miscontrol

1763
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,240
control component is honest

1764
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,599
so if i just come back to this picture

1765
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,480
we will move data considering that the

1766
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,240
first the third and the fourth control

1767
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,480
component are malicious so we we satisfy

1768
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,400
the the requirements of the chancellor

1769
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,599
so we have the second one that is the

1770
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,480
next

1771
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,599
and in this scenario the

1772
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,400
the system that must not but but what's

1773
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,960
secrecy

1774
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,880
so now i can

1775
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,799
show you the attack

1776
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,119
so we have the four control components

1777
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,799
we'll just focus on the tally phase

1778
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,920
so as we as i said before

1779
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,640
the

1780
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,160
the control component receive a stream

1781
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,240
of black box so let's say that the first

1782
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,359
component

1783
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,200
uh receive

1784
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,079
the the electronic box for this cell

1785
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,520
this component will

1786
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,400
mix and decrypt as expected send the

1787
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,760
corresponding

1788
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,319
box to to the second control component

1789
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,400
and at the same time the first control

1790
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,480
component receives the second electronic

1791
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,039
box for forbidden

1792
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,039
again the protocol can

1793
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,680
execute as uh honestly as expected so

1794
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,960
the second control component decrypts

1795
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,359
the first box and the first component

1796
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,200
decrypt the

1797
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,280
the second one

1798
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,039
what's interesting is that

1799
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,480
at this step

1800
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,920
the

1801
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,559
an attacker so for example for instance

1802
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,640
the first control component can

1803
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,960
introduce a fake ballot box and send it

1804
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,680
to the second control component without

1805
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,400
being detected

1806
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,960
the second control component will

1807
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,119
apply the mixing and the decryption of

1808
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,760
the algorithm to the fake ballot box so

1809
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,880
the

1810
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,839
the b box three

1811
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,760
and the unique action that data cameras

1812
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,760
do to to not be detected is just to

1813
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,480
intercept the the certificate produced

1814
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,559
by the by the second control component

1815
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,559
so at this step

1816
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,720
we have the two by the two firstborn box

1817
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,520
that

1818
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,960
that have been

1819
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,119
uh partially decrypted and received by

1820
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,599
the last control component all the

1821
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,359
the six proof has been produced and sent

1822
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,039
to the auditor so the editor can check

1823
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,480
their validity

1824
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,520
and

1825
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,599
since everything is correct as auditor

1826
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,000
will we raise the last part of the key

1827
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,520
to the last component and the last

1828
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,280
component will decrypt

1829
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,359
the two first bullet blocks

1830
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,319
the

1831
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,880
most important thing here is that if we

1832
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,319
assume that the two last components are

1833
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,960
malicious then they can

1834
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,119
call you to find to complete the

1835
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,359
decryption of the fake ballot blocks

1836
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,039
and if we assume that the fake ballot

1837
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,119
box contains a unique

1838
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,039
ballot so let's say the ballot of the

1839
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,000
vote alice then at the end

1840
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,960
the article will be we will learn the

1841
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,280
vote of of alice

1842
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,440
and of course to break the

1843
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,359
vote secrecy

1844
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,920
so this is how the attack works so that

1845
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,520
accord just need to introduce a fake

1846
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,880
bullet box too

1847
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,119
to do the attack

1848
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,680
so if we

1849
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,559
think about the impact of this attack so

1850
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,280
in surrey interior's attack is

1851
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,839
very

1852
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,480
we can break the we can the attacker can

1853
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,280
land the vote of all the voters

1854
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,880
you just need to introduce a fake ballot

1855
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,839
box

1856
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,039
one thing buy a box pair per water

1857
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,960
but in practice attacker will not be

1858
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,680
able to to introduce

1859
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,280
all these fake ballot box because

1860
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,640
introducing effect biobox will introduce

1861
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,440
another computation overhead and thus it

1862
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,000
will be detected if it introduces too

1863
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,240
many infected

1864
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,160
but if we

1865
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,920
if

1866
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,680
because all these bad blocks are quite

1867
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,520
small the attacker can still introduce

1868
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,760
a quite large number of fake white boxes

1869
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,520
that the attacker will be able to learn

1870
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,799
the vote of

1871
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,119
quite a lot of water

1872
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,119
and the important point is that here i

1873
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,340
presented just one attack one

1874
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,720
[Music]

1875
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,039
one scenario of attack but if you think

1876
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,200
about

1877
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,640
this scenario you you can

1878
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,720
find a lot of variants of

1879
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,359
of this attack

1880
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,480
and thus

1881
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,400
when we presented this attack to

1882
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,960
swisspost to the company into the salary

1883
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,960
they consider that this attack is very

1884
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,079
critical and

1885
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,720
yes

1886
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,200
the chancellory uh recorded the swiss

1887
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
pos fix this attack before

1888
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,640
any

1889
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,119
use of the system in practice

1890
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,960
and

1891
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,420
this attack

1892
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,080
[Music]

1893
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,880
has been recognized as critical because

1894
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,359
they gave us a quite generous bounty so

1895
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,920
i think it's a proof that the attack is

1896
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,759
is very

1897
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,679
practical

1898
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,679
so this is for the attack so we decided

1899
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,000
to also discuss with the company to find

1900
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,960
the fix of this attack so the first fix

1901
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,319
we can

1902
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,679
become the company proposed was to just

1903
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,640
require that the components and the

1904
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,560
auditor decrypt and receive exactly one

1905
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,719
uh

1906
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,679
one proof and apply

1907
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,600
the decreased language algorithm the

1908
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,319
correct number of times so exactly if

1909
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,520
there are

1910
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,920
end cities then

1911
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,080
these two components must

1912
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,640
execute the algorithm end times and not

1913
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,000
more

1914
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,759
so doing so you can detect the attack

1915
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,000
but you do not prevent it because you

1916
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,359
will detect

1917
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,520
this attack too late

1918
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,120
so

1919
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,839
we were recommended to the company to

1920
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,198
implement

1921
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,439
more

1922
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,319
other

1923
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,359
fix

1924
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,279
and the fix we

1925
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,600
we recommended is to require that all

1926
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,759
the control components we compute the

1927
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,880
initial barrier boxes

1928
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,560
we'll compute those about box and

1929
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,799
require that they all verify the proof

1930
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,719
of the previous component so for example

1931
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,560
the third component must verify the

1932
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,759
proof of the first and the second

1933
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,360
component

1934
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,239
when we said that the companies say oh

1935
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,320
it would be quite difficult to implement

1936
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,400
because the control component

1937
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,320
has no access to to the initial bullet

1938
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,520
box

1939
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,120
it will be very expensive in terms of

1940
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,520
computation in terms of communication

1941
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,199
it will have the delay before publishing

1942
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,440
the results and so on so yeah it was

1943
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,560
quite

1944
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,480
difficult to commend them but we we

1945
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,920
managed to to convince them in the

1946
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,480
chancery management

1947
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,440
so now what we are uh data could be

1948
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,520
fixed with the strong

1949
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,480
fix we proposed even if the company was

1950
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,360
not

1951
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,280
so happy to do that

1952
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,199
from the beginning

1953
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,600
now in swaziland there is

1954
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,040
a system

1955
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,679
that i've been

1956
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,080
audited many times

1957
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,320
with high level of transparency and thus

1958
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,599
i think we can have quite

1959
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,920
a good

1960
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,040
trust in its security even if probably

1961
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:53,920
not

1962
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,760
perfect

1963
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
an interesting lesson we learned during

1964
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,280
this this work is that

1965
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,679
the security of the formal proof we do

1966
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,800
the system

1967
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,840
must

1968
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,239
consider all the specific cities of

1969
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,360
the protocol

1970
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,760
because protocol before was formally

1971
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,280
approved in computational and in

1972
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,719
symbolic models

1973
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,400
just because i

1974
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,159
completely

1975
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,040
forget to model that there is a lot of

1976
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,880
bad boxes and a lot of

1977
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,480
cities

1978
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,960
and we

1979
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,120
we think that this kind the same kind of

1980
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,480
attacks uh apply for against uh many

1981
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,320
other evolving protocols

1982
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,760
probably uh

1983
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,440
against all the protocols for which we

1984
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,800
you have

1985
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,480
different about boxes or different

1986
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,159
elections using the same cryptographic

1987
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,400
materials

1988
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,920
and i will just stop

1989
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,480
with an interesting question

1990
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,239
an interesting thing

1991
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,880
that is recently the chancellor

1992
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,159
introduced

1993
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,239
a new trust model

1994
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,159
for vote secrecy

1995
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,480
and

1996
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,280
at least from an academic point of view

1997
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,280
they made a mess of all the security

1998
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,440
properties you know security guarantees

1999
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,880
that were

2000
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,400
defined so far

2001
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,760
and this uh

2002
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,360
it will be very interesting to see how

2003
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,360
uh

2004
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,520
the society the company and all the

2005
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,800
experts will find a solution to

2006
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,120
to bridge the gap between

2007
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,840
what we can do in the academic world

2008
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,000
with definition of

2009
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,640
what secrecy and so on and what is

2010
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,719
required in the

2011
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,040
in the system in the

2012
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,440
requirement situation

2013
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,840
but yeah i will not detect this and

2014
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,239
you can just stay on the attack and if a

2015
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:45,199
question

2016
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,480
i'd be happy to

2017
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,480
answer

2018
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,040
okay whilst we write for some questions

2019
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,480
here um someone

2020
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,000
giorgio in the chat has actually got the

2021
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,159
same exact same question i i was about

2022
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,199
to ask you

2023
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,679
um can you sh uh share info about the

2024
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,120
method

2025
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,600
can you share info about the methodology

2026
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,360
used to find the attack

2027
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,199
and um

2028
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,280
did you obtain a contradicting proof or

2029
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,199
in them if you did use the symbolic

2030
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,280
model or how did you do it

2031
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,440
okay so

2032
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,880
to be

2033
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,520
honest

2034
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,360
we

2035
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,840
we discovered the attack because

2036
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,640
two years ago when i arrived in nancy i

2037
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,800
started my postdoc and said okay i have

2038
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,520
to

2039
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,679
i will make do a security proof of

2040
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,600
billionaires so anybody system developed

2041
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,120
in nazi

2042
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,880
and i was very young in booting so

2043
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,880
we started to do assembly proof we

2044
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,480
started to do some reproof with provere

2045
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,199
f with a tool and i said okay we'll

2046
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,400
model

2047
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,760
all the

2048
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,400
scenarios with a very naive point of

2049
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,960
view so i started to model the protocol

2050
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,199
the in the specification it was said

2051
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,280
yeah we can have many elections so i'd

2052
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,199
say it's okay we model many elections

2053
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,080
and

2054
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,280
we found out an attack so oh okay it's

2055
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,480
true

2056
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
we did not found this attack before

2057
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,800
and uh a few months after swisspost

2058
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,679
contacted us we had to to do the same

2059
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,719
job with uh prosperous posts

2060
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,280
so again we decided to

2061
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,360
to model all the elections with all the

2062
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,280
black boxes and

2063
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,440
just yeah just because

2064
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,960
[Music]

2065
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,120
just with a knife point of view

2066
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,040
and again we found out this is this

2067
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,400
attack and

2068
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,239
yeah in symbolic in the symbolic wall

2069
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,080
it's quite easy to detect these attacks

2070
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,199
it's uh

2071
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,440
yeah it's just something that previous

2072
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,040
experts did not do just because they

2073
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,520
they did not think it was

2074
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,440
interesting but yeah it's a symbolic

2075
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,760
model it's very easy to to do this proof

2076
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,800
and to detect this attack

2077
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,080
so i i was looking at a solution and it

2078
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,199
it seems

2079
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,800
very heavyweight

2080
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,360
um was there a reason you couldn't just

2081
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,960
have each

2082
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,239
ccm

2083
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,320
publish a commitment to the messages

2084
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,520
they'd sent

2085
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,760
because obviously the i think in your

2086
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,920
example the third one

2087
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,600
has to lie about the messages they

2088
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,760
received or the it receives different

2089
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,960
messages to the second one sent

2090
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,320
i think you can

2091
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,360
do

2092
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,440
anything like that but

2093
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,199
mainly one problem that you will detect

2094
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,920
the attack too late

2095
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,080
or the second

2096
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,960
problem maybe

2097
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,000
you detect attack before the fourth

2098
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,159
auditor gets any messages before the

2099
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,640
fourth ccm sorry yeah but

2100
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,239
it is

2101
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:01,199
either the system

2102
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,480
do commitment on all that of on all the

2103
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,239
ballot box

2104
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,040
it

2105
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,239
received

2106
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,480
once and if you do that the auditor

2107
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,159
cannot

2108
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,880
check the proof step by step for all the

2109
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,920
ballot box so you add a delay before

2110
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,800
revealing the last part of the key

2111
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,560
so you want to reveal some of the

2112
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,560
election results before all of the votes

2113
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,000
have been counted

2114
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,719
what you want to do is to

2115
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,080
you want to reveal

2116
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,920
the results as soon as possible so you

2117
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,199
want to

2118
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,440
do the to check the proof as soon as

2119
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,400
possible

2120
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,360
and

2121
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,520
if you so if it's an accumulating hash

2122
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,199
that's not a problem right it's you just

2123
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,440
keep adding

2124
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,280
we can take it offline yeah you can

2125
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,040
discuss

2126
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,360
okay very very very quick question you

2127
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,880
have a related question under counter

2128
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,719
measures i'm wondering if the air

2129
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,320
service is in scope for the forward

2130
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,040
verification and how to prevent these

2131
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,920
additional checks to be able to describe

2132
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,800
her

2133
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,520
doubt about the outcome of the correct

2134
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,199
election

2135
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,600
if you uh create a false ballot then you

2136
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,280
will be detected and the election will

2137
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,159
fail

2138
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,600
is it part of the threat model is it

2139
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,000
something you can verify against

2140
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,679
no i think it's not

2141
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,040
considered

2142
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,880
okay thanks

2143
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,239
okay

2144
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,320
thank you very much thank you speaker

2145
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,559
again

2146
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,800
and now it's time for a break
