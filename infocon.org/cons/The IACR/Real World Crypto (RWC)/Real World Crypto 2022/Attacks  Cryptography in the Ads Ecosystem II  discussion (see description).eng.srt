00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,840
so

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,560
can we put the signs on

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,719
hello hello my name is alan chakersky

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,880
and this is joint work with my thesis

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
advisors ayalva nan and abisha wool on

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,559
the security of samsung's keymaster

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
cryptographic design

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
we'll start with some background and

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
motivation

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,800
then we'll dive into our security

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,640
analysis of other protected keys

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
its impact on high level protocols with

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
a remote quality

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,079
and the main lessons that can be learned

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,879
from our attacks

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,479
we use

19
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,560
smartphones for a variety of security

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
critical applications

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,200
we store sensitive information

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
we pay with a service like google pay

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
and we manage most of our digital lives

24
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
on those devices

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,799
this makes them a major target for

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,960
attackers and in recent years we saw

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
public attacks that completely

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
compromise the operating system

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,360
but we still need to protect the

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
cryptographic keys of applications so

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
that attackers will not be able to

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
transfer money from your bank account or

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,240
login to a website such as paypal or

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
twitter for instance

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
for this reason

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
model android devices

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
use arm trust run

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,320
for

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
implementing a trusted execution

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
environment of tee the trans separate

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,759
isolated transon operating system in

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
parallel to android

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,040
there are many different truss zone

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
operating systems and trusted

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,399
applications

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,360
often

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
they

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
they are

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
bundle specific and their design details

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,839
and implementations are kept secret

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
in this research we chose samsung the

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
leading android android vendor as a test

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
case

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
we reverse engineer the cryptographic

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
design of its keymaster

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
analyze the security of other protected

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,160
keys

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,519
and

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
the impact on high level protocols

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
as you can see along trust zone provides

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,599
a logical separation in the two worlds

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,160
the normal world which runs android and

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,680
the secure world the transit trusted os

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,239
we follow the android

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
platform security model that states that

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
the outer protection of cryptographic

67
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
keys should withstand a completely

68
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,560
compromised normal

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,599
finally the android keystroll designed

70
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
by google provides cryptographic key

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
management

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
using the keymaster trusted application

73
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,200
industrason

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
applications can

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,800
ask for key generation and the key

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
master will generate the keys in secure

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
hardware encrypt it with with a hardware

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,879
protected

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
key output derived key and will return

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
the blobs to the application

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
the blobs can be stored on disk or used

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
for key attestation to prove that the

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
key was generated in secure hardware

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
the keys can also be used for

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,480
cryptographic operations such as encrypt

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,959
or sign

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
the important point is that only the

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,159
keymaster trusted application should

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,080
have access to the key material and the

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,599
key material should never leave the

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
trusome

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
now let's dive into our security

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
analysis

94
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
after extensive reverse engineering we

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
discovered that samsung chose to use aes

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,120
gcm to protect its keyboards

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,159
they use

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
a key derivation function to derive a

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
key from the hardware array key

100
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,798
with a

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,478
sold parameter

102
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,040
and then use the encryption iv to

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
encrypt the cryptographic key and get an

104
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
encrypted keyboard

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,840
this is a fragile

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
design

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
this is this is the fragile construction

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
which is not measures resistant and is

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
highly vulnerable to iv reuse

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
two interesting questions are

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
how are the keys derived

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
and now is the iv chosen

113
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,000
we saw that samsung

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
used

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
shot to digest for the

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
for the salt in the kidery version with

117
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
the following values with three main

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
variations

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
in the first variation they use a

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
constant string with a tackle controlled

121
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,880
application id and application data

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
the second variation on galaxy s9 also

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
binds the bootloader state which is

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
constant for our discussion

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
and only in the third variation did

126
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
samsung get

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
16 bytes of randomness that changed the

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,400
derived key every time

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
in the first two variations the salt is

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
con

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
the result is attacker controlled so we

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
can have key reuse

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
to our surprise we also discovered

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
that the android client can set the

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
encryption iv

136
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
this leads to the following iv reuse

137
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,759
attack

138
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
given a key blob a that we wish to

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,600
recover we can extract the iv and

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
using the same iv and salt we can import

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
a known key b into the keystone with the

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
keystore api

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
and we get an encrypting keyblob b

144
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,960
now

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,919
we can serve the ciphertext of a with

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,080
the ciphertext of b to get the cell of

147
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
the plaintext

148
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
and we can so with the non-plaintext of

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,239
b to fully recover the key a

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
the first trivial observation is that

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
once we recover the key material

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
we can use the keys without any

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
restriction

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
so

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
we can bypass protected confirmation and

156
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,280
biometric prompt on android and we don't

157
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
need user consent

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
or presence and we can just transfer

159
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,960
this amount to that account from android

160
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
without the trusted ui taking over

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
but this works only on galaxy s9 and

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,360
similar devices and not on the latest

163
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
galaxy s10 and newer devices

164
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
this is because in the third variation

165
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
the salt is randomized and the derived

166
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
key changes every time so we don't have

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
key reuse

168
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
to our surprise we also discovered that

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
the client is allowed to set the

170
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,479
encryption version

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,240
and

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
this allows an attacker to downgrade all

173
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
new key blobs to a vulnerable encryption

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,080
version and then use the iv reuse attack

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,318
we just saw to fully recover any key

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
now let's see how we can use this to

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,919
break higher level protocols

178
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
we'll start when with an informal

179
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
introduction

180
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
a informal description of the feeder 2

181
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,919
web authentication standard which is

182
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
used for passwordless authentication and

183
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,440
to the sec

184
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
end the second factor

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
for the usual password-based login

186
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
web authentication uses

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,080
a secure

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
secure element to generate and use

189
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
authentication keys

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
usually

191
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
this secure element is an external

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
security key

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
but we already have an internal secure

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
hardware so we can just use the android

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
trusted custom based keystore

196
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,479
the attacker should not be able to

197
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,160
extract then

198
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
the authentication keys and should not

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
be able to clone the

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
platform authenticator

201
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,240
web authentication has two main stages

202
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
in the first stage the user generates

203
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
the keeper

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,080
uses key attestation to prove that they

205
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
will generated insecure outdoor and

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
sends the certificate to the server

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
if the certificate is valid the server

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
registers the user with the public key

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
then when the user wants to log in

210
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
the server sends a unique challenge

211
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,240
and

212
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
after getting user consent the device

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
signs the challenge

214
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
with the private key in the secure order

215
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
if the signature is valid the user is

216
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
signed in

217
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
using nav attacks

218
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
we can downgrade the authentication key

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
to a vulnerable encryption version

220
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
we can use the iv use attack to fully

221
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,760
recover the key material and now we can

222
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,839
clone the platform authenticator and we

223
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
can sign any server challenge

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,920
in our demo on galaxy s10

225
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
we use gdb to implement the downgraded

226
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
attack and then use user

227
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
previous

228
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
iv use attack to recover the private key

229
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
we use the strong key feed to

230
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
server

231
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
and sample application without any

232
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
modifications

233
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
after registration

234
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,820
we recover the private key

235
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,160
[Music]

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,519
we recover the private key of the

237
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,200
authentication key blob

238
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
we verify it against the attestation

239
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
certificate

240
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
and to complete our demo we use a

241
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
separate alternative

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
application that does not use trustzone

243
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,720
and simply uses the recovered key

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
we managed to successfully authenticate

245
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
against strong key's server

246
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,800
strongest remote server over the

247
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
internet

248
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,120
we disclosed the findings to samsung

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
last year and they issued two high

250
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,040
severity cvs and patched over 100

251
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,760
million devices

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,959
now

253
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
our research

254
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,600
involved a lot of extensive reverse

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
engineering and about a month ago

256
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
the lobster soccer group

257
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
leaked the entire samsung source code

258
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
so now you can verify the patches

259
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
and you can see that they

260
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,760
they used to check the iv key parameter

261
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,079
and use it if possible and otherwise

262
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,200
they would randomize the iv and now

263
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,990
they put a little comment instead

264
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,240
[Music]

265
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
they also completely removed the legacy

266
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
keyblob in the legacy encryption version

267
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
and now only the third variation is

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
supported

269
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
we'd like to think that if this code was

270
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
open source then those issues would have

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
been found years ago hopefully before

272
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,399
reaching production devices

273
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
and if not it would still make our

274
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
research much easier and much faster to

275
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
complete

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,120
what can we learn from this

277
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
first of all

278
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
the root cause of both issues is api

279
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
misuse the client should not be able to

280
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
set the encryption iv or the encryption

281
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
version

282
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
also

283
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
the key master as a security critical

284
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
application should have minimal attack

285
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
surface and should not involve

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
any hidden code instead

287
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680
the the ivies in ascm should be unique

288
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
or random

289
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
or we can use a misuse resistant

290
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
construction instead

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
we should also

292
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,399
always use the latest encryption version

293
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,079
if possible

294
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
the bigger issue is in the composability

295
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,639
with higher level protocols that rely on

296
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,440
the

297
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
outdoor protection

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
in protocols like web authentication a

299
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,440
remote trusted public

300
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
remote trusted property uses key at the

301
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,839
station to verify that the key was

302
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
generated in secure hardware as we've

303
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
just seen for samsung devices the secure

304
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,600
outdoor implementation was flawed and

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,560
the cryptographic keys were extracted

306
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
but the feeder server has no way of

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
knowing that

308
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
those devices are vulnerable and to

309
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,200
reject us such certificates because the

310
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,959
attestation certificate does not contain

311
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,240
any information about the

312
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
vendor-specific encryption method

313
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
also

314
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
in fact

315
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
the as long as we have vendor-specific

316
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
black box design

317
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
we can't

318
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
actually prove the correctness of the

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
composition

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
we we hope that our research will

321
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
motivate a uniform open standard for the

322
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
key master to prevent such issues in the

323
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,240
future

324
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
in conclusion

325
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,079
we saw

326
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
the dangerous pitfalls that arise when

327
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
the cryptographic design is kept secret

328
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
we

329
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
would like to argue that the

330
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
cryptographic design should be reviewed

331
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,839
by independent researchers and should

332
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
not rely on the difficulty of reverse

333
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,040
engineering proprietary systems

334
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,279
we also advocate for an open standard

335
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,040
design

336
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,720
finally we think that the

337
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
the design choice of the fragile asgcm

338
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,040
should

339
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
should raise discussion

340
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,839
after too many years of iv reuse in real

341
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
world systems

342
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
thank you for your time

343
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,279
feel free to ask any questions

344
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
uh thanks i love hardcore security stuff

345
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,680
um so you showed us how samsung's fix

346
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,959
for this problem was to remove the

347
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
legacy uh

348
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
backwards compatibility path

349
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,800
um but did they ship that fix to

350
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
existing pieces of hardware and if so

351
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
did they have any kind of like migration

352
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,959
path for old key blobs that um weren't

353
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,000
encrypted

354
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,959
uh with that unique hash

355
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,760
so

356
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
they shipped it in a firmware updates

357
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and you can update the keymaster

358
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,199
trustless application in such updates

359
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,480
and

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
they claim that

361
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,639
the

362
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,560
legacy encryption version should not be

363
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,839
used at all in the world but but as we

364
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,399
saw it an attacker can force and just

365
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,120
ask for such creation but they claim

366
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
that it shouldn't exist at all so any

367
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,519
legitimate apps that use it just got

368
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,480
broken

369
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
yes thank you

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,639
there's a question online from james

371
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
muir who asks what would you recommend

372
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,880
to replace aes gcm a keywrap mode or

373
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,519
something else

374
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
there are other constructions that are

375
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,480
misused resistant uh

376
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
sav i think and

377
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,680
maybe a different cipher

378
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,580
but

379
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,320
[Music]

380
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
or you can just use the cipher

381
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
with

382
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
with the recommended

383
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,920
usage that the nist recommends you just

384
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
thank you

385
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
uh great talk thank you um so i was

386
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,480
curious though the web often spec

387
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
specifies a counter field that the

388
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,680
attestation certificate is supposed to

389
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
conform to

390
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,600
so

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
i'm wondering did you test against uh

392
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,959
like first party services uh and was the

393
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
uh webauthen key that was stored in te

394
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,639
usable after

395
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
uh cloning it because it should be

396
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,519
rejected after you clone it because the

397
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
accounts no longer match

398
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
so actually cloning

399
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,759
to a different device is a subtle issue

400
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
because of the counter

401
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,639
but

402
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
it's not it's not in in the trust zone

403
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
it's only in the android part so yeah if

404
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
you actually want to clone it you you

405
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,120
actually

406
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
need to make sure that you update the

407
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,440
counter on the other device but you can

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
still use it on a different device on

409
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
all on this device and do it without

410
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
yourself knowledge at all oh that's a

411
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,920
good point yeah if you control the okay

412
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,040
yeah all right great thank you

413
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,839
we do have time for any more questions

414
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
all right seeing none then uh please

415
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
join me in thanking the speaker again

416
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,399
thank you

417
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,220
[Applause]

418
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,279
our next speaker in this session will be

419
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,279
luca defeo who will be talking about the

420
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,360
insecurity of elgamel in open vgb

421
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,559
[Applause]

422
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
thank you douglas and

423
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,599
ahoy everyone

424
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,160
i be luca de fero and i'm going to

425
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
present work with me mateys bertram and

426
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,439
alessandro all of ibm research

427
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
on

428
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,039
openpgp and how well gamal is misused in

429
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
openpgp

430
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
so the one slide summary of this

431
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
presentation is

432
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
that details matter

433
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,559
so let's say we're writing a niso

434
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
standard for how to hang pictures you

435
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
must be careful how you

436
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,000
state things

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,799
and obviously it would be to take hammer

438
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,760
and

439
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
strike the nail

440
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,640
and here in the ambiguity you see where

441
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
problems may arrive

442
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
so

443
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
if instead of writing a standard on how

444
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,320
to hang pictures we are writing a

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,880
standard on how to do cryptography

446
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,039
what's the worst that can happen of

447
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,000
course your protocol may be just broken

448
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
we've seen this arrive

449
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,160
something that may happen is that the

450
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,520
protocol is particularly fine the

451
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
specification is correct but then the

452
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
details are in the implementation and

453
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
there may be some psychiatric leakage

454
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
you which you can exploit

455
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
we're going to talk about something

456
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
that's more subtle it's what happens

457
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
when the specification is about a

458
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
cryptographic algorithm that has no

459
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
problem in its own

460
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,520
is just underspecified and so it's

461
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
difficult to come with an implementation

462
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
that's that's correct

463
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
so the easy case is when you have

464
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
implementations which work they pass

465
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
tests they are secure but just they

466
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,559
don't

467
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,240
interoperate because the specification

468
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
is not clear enough

469
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799
the worst that can happen is where these

470
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
implementations do work they pass tests

471
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
they are secure in isolation but they

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
are insecure when they interoperate and

473
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,120
in a silent way which is hard to detect

474
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,039
this is exactly what i'm going to

475
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
show you today

476
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,400
so what's up mpgp in case you don't know

477
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
it's an encryption standard well and

478
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
more signature encryption standard it's

479
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,919
an eatf uh for more than 20 years now uh

480
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
it is one of the most common ways to

481
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
encrypt

482
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
emails along with s mime the s mime

483
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,880
standard

484
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
um of course in the real real world no

485
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
one encrypts emails end to end but here

486
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
we are only a real world crypto so raise

487
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
your hands if you encrypt your emails

488
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
great okay

489
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,039
proves how real this word is

490
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
so there are a few implementations

491
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,120
because it is a standard so you you can

492
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
implement in many different ways

493
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,160
one of the most popular ones is gpg also

494
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,679
known as gnu pg the new privacy guard

495
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
you have button which is used by

496
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,559
thunderbeard since a few releases back

497
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
you have go which has an implementation

498
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
of the parts of the standard in the

499
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
standard library

500
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
libkrito plus plus which is usually used

501
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
for research purposes and there is more

502
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
some of these are not even open source

503
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and we don't know about them

504
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
as for the specification there are a few

505
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
rfcs but the only one that that really

506
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
defines all the protocols and what's

507
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,120
supposed to be in openpgp is the 4880 uh

508
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
which is not really a specification on

509
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
the crypto but just on the message

510
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,760
format what an open pgp message looks

511
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
like

512
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,320
and so if you open this rfc and you look

513
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
into it you will see that there are a

514
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
few uh cryptographic algorithms which

515
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
you're supposed to which you can

516
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,760
implement if you're implementing the

517
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
open pgp standard

518
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
you have a bunch of hash functions uh a

519
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,240
bunch of symmetric ciphers

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,120
then you have public key encryptions um

521
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
at the moment the only ones that are in

522
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
the rfc are rsa elgamal and ecdh

523
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
although if you take specific

524
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
implementations they may implement

525
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,400
something more for example gpg

526
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,679
if i remember correctly implement

527
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
something more

528
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
and then you have also signature

529
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,039
algorithms rsa dsa and cdsa

530
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,600
and this talk is about encryption and

531
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
specifically on the algamal part of this

532
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,360
uh standard and when i say al-gamal i

533
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
really mean the

534
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,120
90s elgamal so finite field algomal no

535
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
elite occurs in the scheme so you take a

536
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
finite field and you do elgamal as it

537
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,679
was first published back in the in the

538
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,960
80s

539
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
and if you look at the standard that you

540
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
see was written until not long ago you

541
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,919
will see that elgamal is the only

542
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,799
mandatory encryption algorithm although

543
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
it's definitely not the most popular the

544
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
most popular is rsa in the open pgp

545
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
ecosystem

546
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,039
and now

547
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
what does it mean to use rsa what does

548
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
it mean to use algamal because the rfc

549
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,240
doesn't really define these

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,559
cryptographic algorithms the rfc just

551
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,400
points to places where you will find the

552
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
definitions of algorithms so for rsa

553
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,760
it's the pkcs standard which is

554
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,880
standard

555
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
fairly used ecdh it sends to two

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
specifications one by nist and one the

557
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,799
rfc

558
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,679
uh dsc and ecdsc is just the phipps

559
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
standard which is the the only one

560
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
that's used for dsa style signatures and

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
elgamal well turns out there is no

562
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,200
elgamal standard at all

563
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,520
so what the specification does is point

564
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,480
to two places uh elgamal's original

565
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
paper from 85 and the handbook of

566
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
applied cryptography which is 10 years

567
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,960
younger than gamal so let's open the

568
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,919
books

569
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,520
what do they say

570
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
i'm afraid it's a bit small to read at

571
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,559
the back

572
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,159
but i'll help you

573
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,520
on the left

574
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,440
oh is there a laser okay no on the left

575
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,039
you have the handbook and on the right

576
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,080
you have

577
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
the

578
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,039
elgamal paper

579
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
so the bots say that you should take a

580
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,320
large random prime p

581
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
and the generator alpha of the

582
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,080
multiplicative group

583
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,039
okay elgamal definitely doesn't say how

584
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,440
you should choose the prime

585
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,520
whereas the handbook says that you

586
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,919
should use algorithm 4.84 now don't go

587
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,679
look at that algorithm it's terrible you

588
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
don't want to implement it it's never

589
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
going to work

590
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,200
next

591
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
you need to select a random integer a

592
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,320
which is going to be your secret

593
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
exponent and both agree that it should

594
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,600
be

595
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,880
somewhere between one and p minus two uh

596
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
elgamal is not entirely clear if you if

597
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,480
you take the extremes of the range

598
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
doesn't really matter much for security

599
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
both are fine

600
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,480
um and then yeah the other place it's uh

601
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
when you do the encryption part uh how

602
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
do you choose the ephemeral exponent and

603
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,000
again it's one between one and p minus

604
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
two depending on which specification you

605
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,559
read so they seem to agree more or less

606
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,960
on what gamal encryption is although

607
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
they don't say how you should generate

608
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
the prime which is fairly important of

609
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,760
course if you want to implement this

610
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,640
and so

611
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,440
what do we do we we went fishing in the

612
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
wild and see what kind of

613
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
choices the various libraries have made

614
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
and so we find a wide range of different

615
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
choices some of which do not even match

616
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
the specification in the handbook and in

617
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,840
algoma's paper

618
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
so for the choice of the prime you have

619
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
various families uh safe primes nor

620
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
primes lim lee primes and other stuff

621
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
some of which we couldn't even guess

622
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
what it was

623
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,000
um i'll get back to this later

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
for the generator of the group so this

625
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,679
is very important for people who do

626
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
proofs for example when you do provable

627
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,760
security you always assume the group is

628
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
a prime order and you have a generator

629
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,440
of the group this does not match the

630
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
definition of elgamal and the handbook

631
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
and so this is a delicate choice and

632
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,400
some implementations choose to do like

633
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
in elgamal's paper some others choose a

634
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,799
generator of the primitive of the

635
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,320
order sub group

636
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,840
and then for the private and public key

637
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
well of course you need to take some

638
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
exponents you need to take them from

639
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
some range it's obvious that you could

640
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,200
take them between 0 and p

641
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,919
but some use a short exponent

642
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,720
optimization because you can

643
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
in the finite field setting at least you

644
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
can take exponents which are only 200

645
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
bits instead of being 2000 bits and

646
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
still have a reasonable security at

647
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,320
least heuristically and so some

648
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
libraries do because it's a 10 times

649
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,199
speed up that's not nothing

650
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,080
but of course when you have all this

651
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,440
variety

652
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
all these different

653
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,320
ways of interpreting the standard and

654
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
all these disagreements what's the worst

655
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
that can happen and so there is one very

656
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559
classical example of engineering

657
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,520
mistakes where two components didn't

658
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
agree fully on the standard and things

659
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,080
went completely haywire that's the mass

660
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
orbiter history uh story where you had

661
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,240
nasa and lockheed martin who were

662
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,720
producing components for this satellite

663
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
to be sent in orbit around mars and nasa

664
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,919
was peaking metric units and lockheed

665
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,559
martin was speaking imperial units and

666
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
this led to a miscalculation of the

667
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
trajectory of the satellite which

668
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
crashed into mars or maybe went out of

669
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,360
orbit we don't know actually

670
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,559
not so

671
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,679
bad in our case no one got injured we

672
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,480
hope

673
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,640
uh what did we find we studied three

674
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,919
popular libraries uh new pg uh crypto

675
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,000
plus plus and sorry four new pg button

676
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,840
crypto plus plus and go

677
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,240
and we found that they

678
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
none of them follows the rfc because of

679
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
these minor variations but they are each

680
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,480
secure if taken in insulation they

681
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
interoperate correctly and securely

682
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
there is no problem if you encrypt a

683
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
message with gpg to someone who's

684
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520
decrypting with button perfectly fine

685
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,520
go is slightly different that it does

686
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
not implement key generation

687
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,720
and actually it's

688
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
it does everything perfectly fine go is

689
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,039
the least offender in the list uh so i

690
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,799
won't speak much about google because uh

691
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,000
apart for

692
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
uh some uh

693
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
side channel leakage which go is not

694
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,120
trying to prevent any way everything is

695
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,919
fine plus i think go has or is

696
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,679
deprecating elgamal encryption

697
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
thank you filippo

698
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
and

699
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,559
the real problems come from keys we

700
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,960
found in the wild because

701
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
okay we could analyze these libraries

702
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
which are open source but

703
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,799
there are other libraries which we don't

704
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,200
know nothing about which we which may be

705
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
using the open pgp standard so we went

706
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
looking for public keys which are

707
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,559
registered on public pgp server and see

708
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,799
what we could find so by

709
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
factoring the order of the groups we

710
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
could understand some things on how

711
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,360
these keys were generated not always

712
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
everything because sometimes factoring

713
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
is too hard what a surprise we need

714
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
quantum computers

715
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,559
and we found that among 800 000 keys uh

716
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,159
only two thousand

717
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,880
of those about two thousand of those are

718
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
vulnerable to a practical uh plaintext

719
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
recovery attack

720
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
which only can only be exploited when

721
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,279
one among gpg button or crypto plus plus

722
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
encrypts a message to these public keys

723
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,440
we don't know who generated this public

724
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,880
is because these public keys clearly

725
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,240
were not generated by any of the

726
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
libraries we studied so

727
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,559
some other software generated this keys

728
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,120
and if you are the unhappy user of the

729
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,279
software you have a problem if someone

730
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,080
with gpg is sending messages to you

731
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,159
some other findings we had

732
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,120
are also some side channel conditions

733
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
in essentially all the libraries we

734
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
looked at the most interesting one is

735
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,760
gpg because gpg claimed to be side

736
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,279
channel resistant

737
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,880
and we showed that there is still some

738
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
leakage in the

739
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
in the exponentiation routine of gpg

740
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,440
which you can exploit to do a plain text

741
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
or more seriously key secret key

742
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,559
recovery

743
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,120
um and also in this case we found that

744
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,159
if

745
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
if you work in a is in a scenario where

746
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
one library is generating the key and

747
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,000
another library a different library is

748
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
doing the uh the encryption then you can

749
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
uh more easily

750
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
implement these side channel attacks

751
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
and so uh collaterally we call we refer

752
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,320
to this as cross configuration attacks

753
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,919
because they come from the interplay

754
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,440
between different libraries that have

755
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,679
made different algorithmic choices on

756
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,039
what it means to do elgamal encryption

757
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
and now i'm going to just give an idea

758
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
of the first one the one that does not

759
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,399
use side channels

760
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,000
just to give you an iteration of how it

761
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
works it it's fairly simple um

762
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
if you stick with me

763
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
so the problem comes from the choice of

764
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
what prime you pick and so as i said

765
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,799
there are more than uh there's more than

766
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,039
one choice your goal is to pick a prime

767
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,200
p such that p minus one has a large

768
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
prime factor because then you have a

769
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,600
strong discrete logarithm problem uh

770
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
related to that large prime factor

771
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
so one popular choice is safe primes so

772
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,360
primes of the form two times q plus one

773
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
where q is prime

774
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,440
but these are kind of expensive to

775
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,760
generate nowadays it's perfectly fine

776
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
but back in the 90s the gpg developers

777
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
found those quite

778
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,679
unusable

779
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,360
so there was another choice which was

780
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,600
popular at the time which was

781
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,360
essentially appeared in a paper by lim

782
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,120
lee and which proposed to use two times

783
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,039
many a product of many primes all large

784
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,039
but none as large as what you would have

785
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,880
in a safe prime

786
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,320
so this is a an easier

787
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,880
prime to generate in terms of

788
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,480
power you need to spend time you need to

789
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,799
spend to find these primes

790
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
and it protects essentially against the

791
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
same attacks against which safe primes

792
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,679
protect

793
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,880
and then you have a different way of

794
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,399
generating these primes which is which

795
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,320
we call the norway because it's

796
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
essentially the way that's recommended

797
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,720
to uh to do snore signatures to do dsa

798
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
it's what you find in fips

799
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
it's definitely the cheapest way to

800
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
generate these safe primes which is you

801
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
first choose q the or the prime order

802
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
and then you multiply by any cofactor

803
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
until you find a prime of the form two

804
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,840
times q times cofactor plus one and half

805
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
here can be arbitrary and usually we'll

806
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
have small factors but this is not a

807
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,120
problem because you have the q factor

808
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
which is large

809
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,799
you have other choices you can take

810
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,399
random primes and just cross your

811
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,240
fingers don't do that

812
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,679
maybe some people have done it we don't

813
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,399
know

814
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
and then we definitely found other ways

815
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,720
that primes were generated and we don't

816
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
know exactly the algorithms but it's

817
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,919
clear that they did something strange

818
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,399
and so when we looked at these 800 000

819
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,240
keys in the wild this is what we found

820
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
the vast majority of primes are just

821
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,519
come from a list of only 16 primes

822
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,480
which

823
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
someone must have standardized but we

824
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
couldn't find the standard so we don't

825
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,120
know where these primes come from we

826
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,559
found a few in some million list

827
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,279
messages but we don't know who's using

828
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,279
these primes and why

829
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,200
and only a very tiny fraction of these

830
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
safe primes were actually generated and

831
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,519
so they may come from crypto plus or

832
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
button

833
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
another fairly large part is a liemly

834
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,039
style primes so this is matches the gpg

835
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,559
implementation so they're probably

836
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,320
generated by gpg

837
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
and then you have a small family which

838
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
we call quasi-safe because the way they

839
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,159
are generated it's close to the way you

840
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,760
would generate safe primes but they're

841
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,039
not safe

842
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,399
doesn't mean they are unsafe actually

843
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,399
they are not vulnerable to our attack

844
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,399
and then even a smaller percentage but

845
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
which is actually quite popular in the

846
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
last five years we found is uh nor style

847
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,360
primes so these primes where it's two

848
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
times q times something some cofactor f

849
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,720
which may be quite smooth

850
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
and so this is where we have the plain

851
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,559
text recovery attack against these

852
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
particular sets of keys there's only two

853
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,200
thousand of them uh in the whole set

854
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,919
so how does the attack work picture this

855
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,799
uh prime p minus one is equal to two

856
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,679
times q times sum product of small

857
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,080
factor so you can imagine this l3 l4 to

858
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
be small uh primes five

859
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
seven a million three

860
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,240
whatever

861
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
and you want to solve the discrete

862
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
logarithm of alpha to the power x so you

863
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,519
want to find x

864
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,880
what you do

865
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
textbook polygelman you can decompose

866
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
this problem

867
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
from a discrete logarithm in the full

868
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
group of order p minus 1 to several

869
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
discrete logarithms in the groups of

870
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
orders 2

871
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,120
2 l 3 l 4 etc

872
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
now for some of these if the prime is

873
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,799
small you will easily solve these

874
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
discrete logarithms by using polar row

875
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,360
or whatever exhaustive search even if

876
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,720
it's two

877
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,279
and so you will get x mod the order of

878
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,799
each of these groups

879
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,039
you won't get x mod q because that's the

880
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,640
large order stock group so you have no

881
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
chances of doing that but if you have

882
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,760
enough primes if you have two l3 l4 and

883
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,918
there are their product is big enough

884
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,440
then you can use the chinese remainder

885
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,560
theorem and recompute x mod 2 times l3

886
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
times l4

887
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,520
which

888
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
normally wouldn't give you x because you

889
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,399
still meet miss the x mod q but if x was

890
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
chosen to be short which is a common

891
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
optimization used by gpg used by button

892
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
used by libre crypto plus plus then you

893
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,800
have a problem because you have found

894
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,639
all of x

895
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,560
and so this is exactly what we did as

896
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,000
simple as that algal encryption just for

897
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
recall what it is it is

898
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,800
prime p generator alpha the message is m

899
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,760
you take a random y then you

900
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,839
put the generator to the power y and

901
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,520
this is where we can solve one discrete

902
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,760
logarithm and the other way where the

903
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,119
other side where we can solve the

904
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
discrete algorithm is in the public key

905
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,320
which is alpha power x so either we can

906
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
find x or we can find y depending on

907
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,200
whether it's x or y that is short

908
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
and so now if we look at what things are

909
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,880
done in practice

910
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
well first thing that may happen is that

911
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
you have version or style prime

912
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
alpha generates the full group and the

913
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
secret key is short

914
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,440
this is an attack which is not cross

915
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,000
configuration and was already proposed

916
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
in the back in the 90s and no library is

917
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,480
vulnerable to that because it's a

918
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,720
well-known attack well we weren't much

919
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,200
smarter than this we just looked okay

920
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,560
which libraries have short exponents

921
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,040
for the encryption part so for the y and

922
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,839
which public keys have snort type of

923
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,680
prime and generators that generate the

924
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,800
full group

925
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
when these libraries

926
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,560
interact

927
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,400
when these libraries interact then you

928
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,839
have a problem because the first three

929
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,800
things

930
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,760
the p minus one the alpha and the x they

931
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,160
are chosen by the library which is

932
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,240
generating the public key whereas the

933
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,680
last thing is chosen by the library

934
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
that's encrypting so if they do not

935
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
agree on how to do things you have a

936
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,880
problem

937
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,680
and yeah this is how we break we broke

938
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
the things

939
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,200
looking again slightly more in details

940
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,520
at this whole set of public keys the two

941
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,680
lines in red are the kinds of public

942
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
keys against which we can mount the

943
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
attack which is more or less practical

944
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
depending on how unlucky you were doing

945
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,760
your key generation but for some of

946
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,200
those keys we could definitely run the

947
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,240
attack on a laptop

948
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
and just one last word on the side

949
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,160
channel as i told you we also have some

950
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,240
side channel attacks they also use these

951
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,040
same kind of things where the leakage

952
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
gives you some information on the public

953
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
key but you still need to run a little

954
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,320
bit of discrete log computation to find

955
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
the missing bits of the secret key

956
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,839
our

957
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,079
framework is a co-located attacker for

958
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,560
example in a cloud environment one core

959
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
is run in gpg and the other core is the

960
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,160
attacker and you can find the secret key

961
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
this way

962
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,240
and so

963
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
this is pretty easy against uh

964
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,680
crypto plus plus and go against gpg it's

965
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,920
interesting because if you try and

966
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,000
attack gpg it's pretty tough like we

967
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
don't have the resources to do it

968
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
but if you suppose that the key was

969
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,720
generated by crypto plus plus and then

970
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,320
fed to gpg

971
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
and then it's gpg that does the

972
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,079
decryption routine then in that case the

973
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,160
attack becomes much easier just because

974
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
crypto plus plus takes even shorter

975
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,839
exponents than gpg

976
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,920
and in that case depending on how lucky

977
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
you're unlucky against again you were

978
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
the attack will be within reach of a

979
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,359
nation-state actor or even within reach

980
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,040
of my laptop

981
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,359
and that's it thanks for your attention

982
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,839
and questions

983
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
thanks for the great talk um you said

984
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
you could do some of the attacks on a

985
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,400
laptop but could you do it in a weekend

986
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,040
on a laptop

987
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,480
um

988
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
i mean the the attack the plaintext

989
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,280
recovery attack it's even a few hours so

990
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,520
much better than a weekend so this is

991
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,680
all basically that they don't implement

992
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,359
key validation

993
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,599
they don't say the key comes in is it of

994
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,079
the right form is the generator blah

995
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,680
blah blah this is all stuff that was

996
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
known in the 90s

997
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,359
and and deployed in electric curve

998
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,920
protocols do they also do not do the

999
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,480
stuff for the elliptic curve versions

1000
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,079
elite curve is a bit more solid because

1001
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,839
they implement the rfc so uh okay

1002
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,520
but yeah yeah these are things that

1003
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,040
could have been prevented but the rfc

1004
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
doesn't even give even give you the ways

1005
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
to prevent them because there's not

1006
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
enough information in the public key

1007
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
format and

1008
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,680
just more so really basic elgamal

1009
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,920
naively just encrypts a message how are

1010
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
they actually using elgamal because just

1011
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
say we're going to elgamal encrypt

1012
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
doesn't mean anything for an email so

1013
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,800
what does that what does it mean it's

1014
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
hybrid encryption it's uh

1015
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
you use algamal and then uh to to to

1016
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,760
encrypt the secret key in an aes secret

1017
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,440
key or some other symmetric cipher

1018
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
secret key

1019
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,960
yes

1020
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,359
uh hi um

1021
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,720
uh i saw a slide that said that uh

1022
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
these implementation implementations

1023
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
were proven secure in isolation

1024
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,160
uh

1025
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,079
and i was wondering uh

1026
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
like what

1027
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
because they're not secure when they're

1028
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,440
interoperating

1029
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,240
uh what was the failure in the security

1030
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
proofs and is there any insight on how

1031
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,880
to do i didn't say proven i said they

1032
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
are securing

1033
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
in isolation that's to the best of our

1034
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,400
knowledge that's as far as we can tell

1035
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,680
they are secure i didn't say there is a

1036
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,960
security proof

1037
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
but we are talking about the algorithm

1038
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,839
so uh i mean elgamal has the usual

1039
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
security proofs in the rom et cetera so

1040
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
in that sense they're proven secure so

1041
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,040
this is not the problem of security

1042
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,160
proofs because we're really talking

1043
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,599
about some very basic cryptographic

1044
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,000
primitive encryption

1045
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,160
again since this is transporting a

1046
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
symmetric key and it's

1047
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
not exactly what is proven secure in

1048
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,599
ccsa secure but i mean in practice they

1049
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,400
are secure if they implement one of the

1050
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,640
safe versions of elgamal and each an

1051
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
isolation implements a safe version of

1052
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
elgamal

1053
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,400
all right thank you

1054
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,880
very quick questions

1055
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,079
so and did you consider the actual pgp

1056
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,680
software by simon tech which used to be

1057
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,960
open source as a book on amazon i know

1058
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,520
you could generate keys with simon tech

1059
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,839
software and test them no we didn't is

1060
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,240
that software still around

1061
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,359
i'm afraid in corporate setups it's

1062
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,000
really used okay it may explain some of

1063
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
our findings we still have a lot of

1064
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,520
questions on where do these keys come

1065
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,400
from we don't know

1066
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,400
have there been any changes to libraries

1067
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
as a result of this or are they still

1068
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,000
continuing with absolutely it's all

1069
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,319
patched right okay botanist patch so

1070
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,040
thunderbird is safe gpg has patched it's

1071
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
fine

1072
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,440
there's also a question online about the

1073
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,119
schnorr primes possibly matching the

1074
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
oakley group so please take a look there

1075
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,599
and on discuss on the zulip please join

1076
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,720
me in thanking our speakers again

1077
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,780
[Music]

1078
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,959
[Applause]

1079
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,520
okay

1080
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,960
oh it's working great

1081
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,359
so let's see for the next session our

1082
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,319
session chair will be dan bonai

1083
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,760
uh he is online so we are just setting

1084
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,720
up so we can see him as well as later on

1085
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,440
the

1086
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,240
invited speaker he will introduce

1087
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,078
yes thanks a lot can everybody see me

1088
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
okay dan we can see you i think you see

1089
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,480
the queue for questions at the top there

1090
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,599
and

1091
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,359
yeah as soon as

1092
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,960
you're done with your introduction then

1093
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,359
we will see slides in the speaker thanks

1094
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,000
terrific all right so uh thank you

1095
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,119
helena

1096
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,960
uh let's see so welcome everyone to our

1097
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,119
last technical session of the day

1098
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,960
um i'm very happy to introduce michael

1099
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,640
clubber who's going to talk tell us

1100
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
about google's efforts in providing

1101
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,359
privacy in the ad ecosystem

1102
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,480
so michael

1103
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,520
floor is yours please go ahead

1104
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,480
great thank you very much uh can you all

1105
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,040
both hear me and see my slides are we

1106
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,960
technically set here yeah we can hear

1107
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,640
you maybe just increase your volume a

1108
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,040
little bit

1109
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,599
increase my volume uh okay i'll try to

1110
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,960
talk louder i don't know what else there

1111
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,440
is to do other than that

1112
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,119
and slides are good you can see the

1113
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,160
slides

1114
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
excellent great okay good cool thank you

1115
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,160
very much um so hello i am michael

1116
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,200
kleber i'm a software engineer at google

1117
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,599
i work on the chrome web browser and

1118
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,720
specifically on a chrome effort called

1119
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,839
the privacy sandbox uh thank you dan and

1120
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,359
others for the invitation to talk i'm

1121
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,920
very sorry that i'm unable to join you

1122
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,280
in person

1123
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,400
um

1124
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,640
the starting point of this work dates

1125
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
back to

1126
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,440
2018

1127
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,319
uh that was

1128
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,280
hold on a sec are we doing this

1129
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,520
there we go uh that was the year that uh

1130
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,480
bashir and wilson had a pets paper uh

1131
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,560
diffusion of user tracking data in the

1132
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,880
online advertising ecosystem

1133
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,920
uh they instrumented a web browser to

1134
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,160
understand the widespread cookie

1135
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,040
matching practices that were used by the

1136
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,599
online advertising industry

1137
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,720
they found that there were 52 ads and

1138
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,800
analytics companies that were each able

1139
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,599
to

1140
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,680
build a pseudonymous profile which

1141
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,480
contained more than 90 percent of the

1142
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000
urls visited by an average web browser

1143
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
and if you lower your threshold for

1144
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,480
yikes from 90

1145
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,520
to uh observing 50 of the urls that our

1146
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,440
browser visits the number of companies

1147
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,000
that could do that skyrocketed to

1148
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
over 600

1149
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,240
um

1150
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,280
so

1151
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,160
the bashir and wilson paper was focused

1152
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,200
on tracking using third-party cookies

1153
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,280
that is uh using pseudonymous

1154
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,480
identifiers that one particular domain

1155
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,160
can read and write anytime a source from

1156
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,119
that domain is used in a web page that

1157
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,560
you visit

1158
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,440
um it is more pervasive than that

1159
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
description makes it sound though

1160
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,160
because the advertising industry

1161
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,040
maintains giant cookie matching tables

1162
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,079
so that is even though food.com and

1163
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,880
bar.com seem to have two different

1164
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
pseudonymous identifiers they may

1165
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,200
cooperate with each other to let both of

1166
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,480
them learn about a web page even if only

1167
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
one of the two interacts with your

1168
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
browser

1169
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,800
beyond cookies the same sort of

1170
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,560
cross-site trafficking

1171
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,359
also happens in more covert ways

1172
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
particularly using

1173
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,319
device fingerprinting techniques

1174
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,079
uh so some other related things were

1175
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,040
also happening in 2018

1176
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,000
uh first gdpr came into effect in the eu

1177
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,400
i think many people

1178
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,640
hoped that would lead to a dramatic

1179
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,040
decrease in the type of tracking that

1180
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,760
i'm talking about but observations since

1181
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,160
then are that it instead led to a

1182
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,240
dramatic increase in cookie consent

1183
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
banners

1184
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,280
uh

1185
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,440
also in 2018 uh apple's uh safari web

1186
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,839
browser started blocking third-party

1187
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,880
cookies from some particularly large and

1188
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,240
prevalent sites with the release of uh

1189
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,359
webkit itp 2.0

1190
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,720
um

1191
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,280
it eventually uh safari eventually

1192
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
switched to blocking all third-party

1193
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
cookie

1194
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,720
keys in 2021

1195
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,040
the impacts here are a lot more

1196
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,119
complicated uh

1197
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,200
just to point out a few things they

1198
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,079
include some ad tech switching from

1199
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,359
cookies to fingerprinting or other types

1200
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,359
of covert tracking

1201
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,920
and they include some content and

1202
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,119
therefore some ad money and therefore

1203
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,119
some tracking moving from the web to the

1204
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,000
app ecosystem instead

1205
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,920
uh those two things are actually

1206
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,160
interrelated because

1207
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,240
in apps the fingerprinting problem is

1208
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,319
both easier to do and harder to study

1209
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,880
uh i don't plan to talk more about the

1210
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,520
app side of this story today but if

1211
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
you're interested in this topic uh the

1212
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,040
call at al uh prepaint uh whose

1213
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,200
title starts goodbye tracking question

1214
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,359
mark uh that just came out last week is

1215
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,040
an amazing piece of research that i

1216
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
highly recommend you uh you go and read

1217
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,040
i love it

1218
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,640
um

1219
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,720
okay uh so perhaps some of these

1220
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,280
outcomes surprise you like why would all

1221
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,000
of these things happen and the answer is

1222
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
it turns out that this tracking that

1223
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,079
we're talking about really does make

1224
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,440
money

1225
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,319
um i stole this literature review slide

1226
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,960
from garrett johnson from boston

1227
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
university's questroom school of

1228
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,240
business

1229
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,760
across studies from academia and

1230
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,920
industry those are the gray rose which

1231
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,800
you might be more suspicious of um and

1232
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,200
government agencies uh we have pretty

1233
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,400
consistent results uh if you stop using

1234
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,680
third-party cookies for targeting then

1235
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,480
most ad-supported websites lose

1236
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,599
something like 50 to 70 percent of their

1237
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,119
revenue

1238
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,079
and

1239
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,760
listen by the way i i

1240
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,200
we all know that i work for google so

1241
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,880
let me be clear that uh google is not a

1242
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,280
site that would suffer that kind of loss

1243
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,520
google makes a lot of money on ads it is

1244
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,880
true but most of that is from ads on the

1245
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,520
google search results page and the ad

1246
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,119
choices there don't need third party

1247
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,040
cookies to help guess what kind of ad to

1248
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,920
show you

1249
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
right people who come to google.com type

1250
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,920
into a little box exactly what we should

1251
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,960
show them the ads for um so

1252
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,240
and there are some other sites that are

1253
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,119
likewise just fine there are web pages

1254
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,440
about reviews of new cell phones and

1255
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,640
they're great they don't need third

1256
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,400
party cookies either to know to show you

1257
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
ads about reviews for hot new cell

1258
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,359
phones you might buy but web pages about

1259
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,680
the omicron variant or about climate

1260
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,760
change like ad space there really

1261
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,680
benefits from those cookies

1262
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,559
um

1263
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,440
the google a b experiment row 5 in gray

1264
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,520
on this slide measured an average of 52

1265
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,000
revenue loss overall but an average of

1266
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
62 revenue lost specifically when you

1267
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,480
look at news sites so some sites are

1268
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,440
affected much more than others

1269
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,440
um okay so let me point out two

1270
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,839
consequences of this revenue loss number

1271
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,359
uh thing one

1272
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,240
if we did have a way to just stop all

1273
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
tracking and people couldn't substitute

1274
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,079
a different tracking technique or a

1275
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,960
different platform then a lot of sites

1276
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,040
would make a lot less money right maybe

1277
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,079
not that full 50 to 70 revenue hit

1278
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,480
that's not an equilibrium outcome but

1279
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,880
most of it um and so a lot of people

1280
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,240
would lose their jobs there would be

1281
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,800
many fewer sites there would be much

1282
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,640
less on the web

1283
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,280
uh but a second thing that is maybe less

1284
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,040
obvious that i want to point out is that

1285
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
if you turn that lose 50 to 70 percent

1286
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,920
around what it means is that if you

1287
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,400
imagine a world without cookies

1288
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,119
someone who figures out how to do

1289
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,240
tracking

1290
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,720
can go around to all of these websites

1291
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,480
and ad tech companies and sell

1292
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,720
themselves as hey if you use my

1293
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
circumvention technique then websites

1294
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,960
get a twofold to threefold increase in

1295
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,040
their revenue right and that is an

1296
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,920
extremely strong incentive to keep doing

1297
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,480
whatever it takes to keep tracking

1298
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,880
people

1299
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
uh yeah i

1300
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,160
think uh well somebody posted in a chat

1301
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,760
archive reference and i haven't followed

1302
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,119
up so i'm not sure what that is thank

1303
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,040
you um

1304
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,559
okay so now at last i can tell you uh

1305
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,640
what the pro problem is that chrome's

1306
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,680
privacy sandbox is trying to solve uh

1307
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
first we want to stop all of this user

1308
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,040
tracking

1309
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,720
and in particular

1310
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,800
change the web so that it no longer

1311
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,839
supports building a profile of a single

1312
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,079
person as they browse across a lot of

1313
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,839
unrelated websites

1314
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,240
um and second we want to ensure that web

1315
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,800
developers who use third-party cookies

1316
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,880
today and that includes the online

1317
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,200
advertising ecosystem we want to ensure

1318
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,880
that these folks have other ways to

1319
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,680
accomplish their goals with better

1320
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,319
privacy properties built in

1321
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,640
right and it's really much harder if you

1322
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,119
try to do one of these two tasks without

1323
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,160
the other

1324
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,480
right because if the new more private

1325
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,920
techniques work as well or nearly as

1326
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,559
well as the old tracking based ways then

1327
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
yes it will take a bunch of work but we

1328
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,240
can migrate the ads ecosystem to use

1329
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,040
them

1330
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,839
but on the other hand if there remains a

1331
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,800
huge revenue gap between tracking based

1332
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,520
monetization and privacy preserving

1333
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,319
monetization then we will see all of

1334
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,559
that work of this billions of dollars a

1335
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,280
year industry going into circumvention

1336
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,319
and covert tracking instead

1337
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,280
okay so with that as motivation i'm now

1338
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,680
going to zoom in on two specific

1339
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,960
capabilities that we chrome want to add

1340
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,440
to the web to keep ads working without

1341
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,240
user tracking

1342
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,559
okay

1343
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,520
the first one is a way to perform on

1344
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,599
device ad auctions

1345
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,319
we have proposed a system called fledge

1346
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,400
uh that's based on an earlier proposal

1347
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,800
called turtledove i apologize for all of

1348
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,760
the bird references things got a little

1349
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,079
out of hand in 2020 i think we've mostly

1350
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,559
recovered from that phase

1351
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:21,760
anyway

1352
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,720
okay so for fledge the basic flow looks

1353
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,920
like this

1354
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,200
um

1355
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,079
uh unfortunately the adtech ecosystem is

1356
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,400
extremely complicated which has forced

1357
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,000
some amount of complexity into the

1358
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,319
system that we are designing to support

1359
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,599
it but in as simple a form as possible

1360
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,240
uh the flow is at some point a person

1361
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,359
browses a website add some advertiser or

1362
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,920
more likely an ad tech company working

1363
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,200
for some advertiser says aha based on

1364
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,359
what you just did i would like to show

1365
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,839
my ads to you in the future

1366
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,680
uh in the conventional world of

1367
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,280
advertising with third-party cookies

1368
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,400
this would involve

1369
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,240
putting the person's pseudonymous

1370
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,480
identifier on a list of people

1371
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,240
interested in something and then

1372
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,960
recognizing that identifier during their

1373
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,200
future ad requests

1374
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,160
in the fledge model instead at that

1375
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,079
point when somebody does something that

1376
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,920
leads you to want to show them ads in

1377
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,960
the future

1378
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
um

1379
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,559
uh the advertiser hands the browser a

1380
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,160
bundle of information which we are

1381
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,079
calling an interest group

1382
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,040
and that consists primarily of

1383
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,359
first a collection of ads that the

1384
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,440
advertiser might want to show the person

1385
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,359
in the future

1386
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,319
and second an on device bidding function

1387
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,800
so a piece of javascript which will run

1388
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,119
in the future and which will decide how

1389
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,359
much the advertiser is willing to pay to

1390
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,000
have their ad appear in a particular ad

1391
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,880
slot

1392
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,400
and that odd device bidding function

1393
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,599
will get to run lots of times and if the

1394
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,200
bid that it comes up with is high enough

1395
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
then the corresponding ad will appear

1396
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
sometimes

1397
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,079
so then later uh the same person visits

1398
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,240
a website that wants to show ads right

1399
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,200
we call those sites publishers

1400
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,079
and the ad tech company working for the

1401
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,599
publisher runs a normal contextual ad

1402
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,040
auction this is a world where there's no

1403
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
third party cookies anymore but you can

1404
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,200
still run a normal ad auction based on

1405
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,359
for example the context of the page that

1406
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,119
you're in the middle of visiting

1407
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,839
and then follows that up with an on

1408
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,040
device auction among those previously

1409
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,119
stored interest groups

1410
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,680
each interest group is a potential buyer

1411
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,160
in this auction their previously stored

1412
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,319
javascript functions each get a chance

1413
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,079
to emit a bid

1414
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,000
and then the seller who is running the

1415
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
auction scores those bids with their own

1416
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,119
on-device javascript that picks the one

1417
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,200
that the publisher site likes best

1418
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,400
whether that's the one that gets the

1419
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,079
most money or some other criteria

1420
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,160
whatever

1421
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,000
the javascript bidding and scoring

1422
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,319
functions all are isolated in that they

1423
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,559
don't get to interact with the web page

1424
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,680
or with servers or with storage

1425
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,559
um

1426
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,720
uh and we want some there there are some

1427
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,119
other constraints also we would like to

1428
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,720
ensure that the ads that we're showing

1429
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,680
are being seen by at least uh k

1430
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,359
different people we want some kind of k

1431
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,119
anonymity it helps with privacy

1432
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,640
properties of the reporting which i'll

1433
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,200
touch on a little later uh and it also

1434
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
may help the ads from feeling uh too

1435
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,400
creepy uh and the distributed canonimity

1436
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,720
check is tricky for all the reasons that

1437
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,799
you folks here can imagine

1438
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,920
um but i would like to

1439
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,240
talk about a bigger problem that i've

1440
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,200
been

1441
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,079
sweeping under the rug

1442
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,040
those javascript bidding functions

1443
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,839
actually do need some real-time

1444
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,119
information uh they cannot actually bid

1445
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,680
in isolation just using the pre-loaded

1446
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,240
data sitting on the device

1447
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,440
uh and just for a few examples um

1448
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,839
every ad campaign has some budget like

1449
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,160
some amount of money that they can spend

1450
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,960
this day or this week or this month um

1451
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,799
if they're out of cash they cannot spend

1452
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,040
more money to buy more ad space that's

1453
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,880
generally not allowed when you're buying

1454
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,760
things

1455
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,880
um and also uh advertisers need to be

1456
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,720
able to stop serving ads on a particular

1457
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
site right away right if their ad

1458
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,960
appears on what turned out to be a covid

1459
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,200
disinformation site they can't say well

1460
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,799
we don't support this message but it

1461
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,640
will take us a week before we stop

1462
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,079
giving them money and buying their ad

1463
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,599
space like they you know actually need

1464
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,880
to be able to control things in real

1465
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,720
time

1466
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,359
so for these sorts of use cases the

1467
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,160
fledge proposal actually allows each

1468
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,559
interest group to store in the browser

1469
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,119
alongside the collection of ads and

1470
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,440
bidding logic uh store some look up keys

1471
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,880
um

1472
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,240
uh

1473
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,000
uh

1474
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,280
sorry yeah um store some lookup keys

1475
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,680
which are used at the time of the

1476
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,079
on-device auction to retrieve some

1477
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,280
associated values from a database

1478
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,319
so of course if we just sent a server

1479
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,160
the set of keys whose values we want to

1480
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,559
retrieve this look up operation itself

1481
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,720
would be a privacy leakage a tracking

1482
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,599
vector we could avoid that risk with

1483
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,680
some type of private information

1484
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,040
retrieval scheme

1485
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,640
but the scale here is daunting like the

1486
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,760
key value database that we need to query

1487
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,400
is large it has there are millions of ad

1488
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,480
campaigns and that's crossed with

1489
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,640
millions of websites every ad campaign

1490
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,160
might have different opinions about

1491
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,720
which websites it's willing to run on um

1492
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,960
it's being queried billions of times a

1493
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,760
day like every web page that is loaded

1494
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,160
um also the database changes very

1495
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,119
quickly

1496
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,599
even if you imagine an average database

1497
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,480
entry changes only once per day that

1498
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,799
already does not play well with a pir

1499
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,359
scheme that relies on like substantial

1500
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,599
offline pre-processing in order to get

1501
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,760
sub-linear retrieval

1502
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,119
um i i don't yet know whether pir is a

1503
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,440
viable solution at the scale that we're

1504
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,480
talking about

1505
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,359
um

1506
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,720
uh or whether instead we have to rely on

1507
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,640
some kind of trusted hardware based

1508
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,599
solution like a cloud providers trusted

1509
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,200
execution environment uh for example aws

1510
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,079
nitro tpm or azure's

1511
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,480
secure enclaves that are rooted in intel

1512
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,760
sgx

1513
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,319
uh the answer here may come down to how

1514
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,799
much overhead you're willing to pay

1515
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,400
to avoid trusting that a cloud provider

1516
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,720
like amazon or

1517
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,880
azure won't mount a physical side

1518
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,720
channel attack on the machine's house in

1519
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,520
its own data center

1520
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,839
okay

1521
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,400
finally second i want to turn to

1522
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,599
one other crucial part of the online

1523
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,799
advertising ecosystem

1524
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,640
that is

1525
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,119
much less visible than the ad selection

1526
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,359
process and that's the task of measuring

1527
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,520
whether ads actually had the desired

1528
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,960
effect

1529
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,359
this question applies to all types of ad

1530
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,760
targeting whether it's an on-device

1531
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,400
auction like fledge or is purely

1532
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,280
contextual targeting

1533
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,240
the essential goal here is attributing

1534
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,200
conversions and i'll define both words

1535
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,160
um

1536
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,240
a conversion is when a person does

1537
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,480
whatever an advertiser hoped that they

1538
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,599
would do

1539
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,280
the most obvious is buying something on

1540
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,040
the advertiser's website

1541
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,920
uh attribution is the task of

1542
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,160
associating a conversion with some

1543
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,400
previous ad that the person saw or

1544
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,799
interacted with that is an attribution

1545
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,359
is an attempt to give credit to the ad

1546
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,440
that led to the conversion

1547
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,240
um in reality advertisers often stick to

1548
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,640
correlation not causation that's a real

1549
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,440
pity uh i think you heard james ray's

1550
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
talk earlier which touched on the harder

1551
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,280
problem of trying to actually measure

1552
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,200
causality i'm going to stick to the

1553
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,599
so-called easy task for now

1554
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,720
um

1555
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,359
advertisers usually use one of a few

1556
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,160
very simple models to account for

1557
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,839
the fact that the same person may have

1558
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,520
seen multiple ads from the same

1559
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,359
advertiser in the time leading up to the

1560
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,119
conversion right when a conversion

1561
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,319
happens

1562
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,000
you can say well the credit for that

1563
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,079
goes to the most recent ad the person

1564
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,040
saw that's called last touch attribution

1565
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,280
or maybe they use first touch

1566
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,440
attribution like as if the first ad

1567
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
planted the seed that later bore fruit

1568
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,200
when the conversion happened or there

1569
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,280
are other models in which multiple ads

1570
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,440
share parts of the credit spread out

1571
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,920
uniformly across all the ads or with

1572
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,599
exponential time decay so the most

1573
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,359
recent ad is the most important and so

1574
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:44,640
on like there are lots of different

1575
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,440
possibilities for how to do this

1576
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,799
um

1577
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,119
but at a high level when an advertiser

1578
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,079
shows an ad they have just spent money

1579
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,240
and then a conversion later involves

1580
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,400
them making money and so the conversion

1581
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,079
attribution is trying to get at the

1582
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,160
question of whether the spend was worth

1583
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,040
it

1584
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,520
that answer might show up in the

1585
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,359
reporting that advertisers look at when

1586
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,720
they decide how to spend their money in

1587
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,760
the future or might feed into an ad tech

1588
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,200
company training a machine learning

1589
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,079
model to optimize return on investment

1590
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,000
on behalf of the advertisers that they

1591
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,319
work with

1592
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,400
so conversion measurement is just crying

1593
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,520
out for the type of generalized privacy

1594
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,760
preserving noise aggregation that

1595
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,000
christopher patton talked about uh at

1596
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,480
this time yesterday uh advertisers want

1597
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,720
to know things like what fraction of

1598
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,280
people who saw my ad on site x later or

1599
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,200
bought something right historically

1600
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,480
they've done this using third-party

1601
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,240
cookies of course they

1602
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,920
use a pseudonymous identifier to

1603
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,680
recognize the person who saw the ad and

1604
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,359
then they see that same pseudonymous

1605
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,280
identifier at the time the person makes

1606
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,280
the purchase but that's overkill like

1607
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,839
what they really want to know is a quite

1608
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,680
privacy compatible

1609
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,920
question about groups not about

1610
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,839
individuals

1611
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,599
but unfortunately this all gets more

1612
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,440
complicated because there are lots of

1613
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,839
different parties involved right and in

1614
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,200
fact maybe some of you have already

1615
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,440
spotted the trap hiding here but just

1616
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,039
just to be clear

1617
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,640
one advertiser

1618
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,119
might run ads through different ad

1619
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,359
networks their ads are certainly going

1620
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,480
to appear on many different websites

1621
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,559
each ad network wants to report about

1622
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,280
how the ads that it showed correlated

1623
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,839
with subsequent conversions

1624
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,559
that report involves a person's actions

1625
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,640
on at least two sites the one where they

1626
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,319
saw the ad and the one where they

1627
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,720
converted and is being reported to an ad

1628
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,240
network that's often a third party in

1629
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,079
both cases or maybe

1630
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,039
even more parties uh who were involved

1631
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,240
and who want to know things if the

1632
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,319
person saw multiple ads

1633
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,880
right so the question is

1634
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,240
how do they all share epsilon like

1635
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,559
aggregation with differential private

1636
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,200
noise that's eating up someone's epsilon

1637
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,760
budget but whose budget is it and how is

1638
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,240
it allocated among all of these parties

1639
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,079
like there are a lot of possible answers

1640
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,920
here and every one of them is bad or at

1641
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,960
least every one of them has its

1642
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,160
downsides like either different ad tech

1643
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,240
companies are competing to steal epsilon

1644
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,400
budget from one another or else they

1645
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,920
might try to game the system by

1646
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,799
collaborating or by taking one big ad

1647
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,319
tech company and splitting it into

1648
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,119
multiple smaller ad tech companies or

1649
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,200
even if everyone somehow wants to play

1650
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,680
nicely with one another they need to

1651
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,760
orchestrate carefully to avoid the

1652
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,240
reporting on one event starving another

1653
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,880
event of reporting budget by accident

1654
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,200
like with some budgeting schemes

1655
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,440
completely independent ads on the same

1656
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,280
page are in competition for epsilon

1657
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,440
budget and in those cases fair choices

1658
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,599
about who can report what involve like

1659
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,200
information propagating backwards in

1660
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,039
time

1661
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,359
and finally uh in case you thought that

1662
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,599
all of that actually has answers and

1663
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,880
it's straightforward and you know how to

1664
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,400
do it i'll point out that for the

1665
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,359
optimization use case we need to share

1666
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,440
epsilon while also training machine

1667
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,119
learning models using this aggregated

1668
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,000
data

1669
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,640
uh the microsoft mask lark proposal that

1670
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,640
was mentioned yesterday in the mpc

1671
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,280
aggregation context is one indication of

1672
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,920
how this might be possible uh french ad

1673
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,920
company croteo ran a contest last year

1674
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,680
that pointed to additional approaches

1675
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,440
but this is

1676
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,920
very definitely not yet settled

1677
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,880
um so that's where i'll stop uh there's

1678
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,559
lots of real world with some kind of

1679
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,799
crypto shaped holes in them and i hope

1680
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,400
that we can come back and talk to you

1681
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,359
next year about what is done not uh just

1682
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,910
what is in progress thank you very much

1683
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,969
[Applause]

1684
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,720
great thanks michael this is a really

1685
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,480
good overview of what's happening in

1686
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,799
space uh i guess one question that comes

1687
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,200
that came up is uh this issue of uh

1688
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,799
fraud prevention and particular things

1689
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,839
like uh click fraud and um other fraud

1690
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,400
prevention in the ad ecosystem how how

1691
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,079
does this how is all this privacy

1692
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,400
technology going to interact with fraud

1693
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,200
prevention in the ecosystem

1694
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,359
yeah uh that that's an outstanding

1695
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,799
question uh as i said the things i

1696
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,880
mentioned are just two small pieces of

1697
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,000
the larger privacy sandbox question um

1698
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,799
so

1699
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,680
uh

1700
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,200
some answers is that uh there are

1701
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,119
uh

1702
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,960
a few different fraud prevention

1703
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,520
proposals that are uh in the middle of

1704
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,280
being worked on side by side with all of

1705
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,160
these um that rely on uh

1706
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,039
trust tokens so privacy past style

1707
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,599
blind signatures uh in order to help

1708
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,720
move kind of information around um

1709
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,039
uh in a way that is you know provably

1710
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,119
non-identifiable but at the same time

1711
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,400
lets you uh at least bind the fact that

1712
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,280
a person seem to be trustworthy in one

1713
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,720
environment uh and then you can say well

1714
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,839
if you're trustworthy in this

1715
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,119
environment then you're probably

1716
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,720
trustworthy in this other environment

1717
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,760
even though i don't have a single

1718
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,000
identifier to recognize that you are the

1719
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,839
same person that was considered

1720
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:04,960
trustworthy over in that other

1721
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,760
environment um and similar sort of blind

1722
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,559
signatures thing um uh can be used for

1723
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,319
example as part of the conversion

1724
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,960
attribution things to make sure that the

1725
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,160
um

1726
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,520
the individual events like the

1727
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,280
impression event and the conversion

1728
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,280
event individually look trustworthy and

1729
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,160
then you can uh pass along

1730
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,799
some sense of trust in those uh uh

1731
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,720
through the association attribution

1732
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,880
process um but

1733
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,920
i mean in a broader sense the answer is

1734
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,640
there is not a end-to-end answer to this

1735
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,720
question uh really i didn't spend a lot

1736
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,760
of my time here talking about

1737
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,920
fingerprinting right the gathering up

1738
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,319
lots of little bits of information in

1739
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:47,359
order to uh uh track people like in

1740
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,920
order to uniquely identify devices um it

1741
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,400
turns out that the the the

1742
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,559
pieces of information that are used in

1743
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,799
fingerprinting have a bunch of overlap

1744
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,400
with pieces of information that are used

1745
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,559
in fraud detection and fraud prevention

1746
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,599
um

1747
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,520
that gets into complicated questions of

1748
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,720
whether there really is a feasible like

1749
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,960
technical purpose limitation approach so

1750
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,240
that we can let people collect

1751
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,079
information if they're willing to use it

1752
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,599
for some things but not if they're

1753
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,440
willing to use it for other things

1754
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,599
in the business world people

1755
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,200
get away with doing that by signing

1756
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,119
contracts with each other all the time

1757
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,680
unfortunately web browsers don't have a

1758
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,440
contract that they are signing with

1759
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,760
every website so we can't tell a website

1760
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,440
you can only have this information if

1761
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,599
you promise to do good things with it um

1762
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,720
but there are a lot of people who are

1763
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,240
trying to figure out if there is some

1764
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,240
approximation of that approach perhaps

1765
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,880
with the cooperation of uh

1766
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,760
national privacy regulators for example

1767
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,839
uh that makes some kind of purpose

1768
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,960
limitation uh actually feasible as a as

1769
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,359
a privacy help so actually yeah that's a

1770
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,680
that thanks michael that that does

1771
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,599
clarify things there's a question in the

1772
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,799
mic so uh please go ahead yes thank you

1773
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,440
i know there's also proposals for um

1774
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,200
having users specify their own ad

1775
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,039
interests in their browsers

1776
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,440
uh i'm wondering what your opinion is of

1777
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,599
that and also

1778
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,119
with fledge how much visibility and

1779
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,720
understandability do users have about

1780
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,000
the ads that are shown to them

1781
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,759
yeah uh let me let me answer those in

1782
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,560
reverse order uh first of all the the

1783
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,198
the options for visibility and like the

1784
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,198
ui associated with understanding what's

1785
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:27,040
going on uh

1786
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,359
when the browser has become part of the

1787
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,920
ad system so like understands the ads

1788
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,198
that are being carried around for you

1789
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,520
and be shown to you is one of the huge

1790
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,000
wins here like there's a large amount of

1791
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,560
work that we have put into the uh the ui

1792
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,960
and user experience research going into

1793
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,439
how we can best have the browser like

1794
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,279
it's the user agent it can act on behalf

1795
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,080
of the user and so we have a vast amount

1796
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,560
more understanding and so uh things like

1797
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,560
why did i see this ad is a question

1798
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,799
where in the case of like not purely

1799
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,719
contextually targeted ads

1800
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,560
we think that the browser will be in a

1801
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,439
position to offer a lot more visibility

1802
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,520
the very first

1803
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,920
versions of this ui are in the version

1804
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,679
of chrome beta that is uh i think being

1805
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,439
installed on your device this week if

1806
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,679
you are on the data channel so uh please

1807
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,359
take a look at it and we'd love to talk

1808
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,520
about that more soon

1809
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,479
in terms of uh uh user specified ad

1810
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,839
interest there are a few proposals

1811
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,279
there's a proposal called topics that

1812
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,040
comes from chrome there's a few other

1813
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,520
proposals that are around uh more

1814
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,080
user-specified interests um i i think

1815
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,158
the answer is so first of all obviously

1816
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,520
all of those need good privacy

1817
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,520
properties right it doesn't matter

1818
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,439
whether you volunteer a set of interests

1819
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,960
if they're uniquely identifiable it's a

1820
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,479
fingerprint for you and all of a sudden

1821
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,839
we're right back to square one on

1822
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,600
tracking right so the browser obviously

1823
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,759
has some obligation to make sure that

1824
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,560
whatever information is made available

1825
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,799
is not enough to like quickly learn who

1826
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,040
you are of course

1827
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,320
uh uh

1828
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,320
if you spend a lot of time doing things

1829
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,719
and change state over time then

1830
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,640
eventually for a website that gets to

1831
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,800
see information about you over a long

1832
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
enough period of time unless there's

1833
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,400
again some kind of magical purpose

1834
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,239
limitation that says people can't store

1835
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
information forever you know a site that

1836
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,840
you visit every week for a year is going

1837
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,199
to have a lot more information as a

1838
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:18,719
result of that than a site that you only

1839
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,800
visit once um so i think there's not a

1840
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,280
perfect answer there um but

1841
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,000
after the question of um

1842
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,800
uh can we prevent you know prevent this

1843
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,640
type of information from just being an

1844
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,040
outright fingerprinting vector um the

1845
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,679
question of what is sensitive

1846
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,360
information like what is information

1847
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,840
that people are happy to see ads based

1848
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,920
on versus one that they're not again

1849
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,560
veers over uh i mean

1850
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,760
they went together in your question for

1851
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,120
a good reason right that veers very

1852
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,520
directly into user experience uh

1853
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,440
research questions about what it is that

1854
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,520
people are happy with so you know

1855
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,760
understanding people's expectations and

1856
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,320
people's sense of whether the browser is

1857
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,400
doing a good job of not revealing things

1858
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,239
that they consider like problematic or

1859
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,480
sensitive but is your you know revealing

1860
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,400
information they think enhances their

1861
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,400
overall experience and usage of the web

1862
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
um user experience research is working

1863
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,719
on figuring out where to draw that line

1864
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,080
i don't think the answer is completely

1865
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,159
clear but i think that there's a lot of

1866
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,440
room to make things dramatically better

1867
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,199
than where we are today great yeah

1868
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,640
thanks michael i think we're actually

1869
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,920
we're actually at uh time

1870
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:24,719
yes

1871
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,880
if i could just maybe insert one

1872
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,800
question from zulip there's three over

1873
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,440
there so we'll maybe just take one even

1874
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,120
if we're a little bit over time

1875
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,600
um okay i'll pick

1876
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,840
this one here can fledge be used to

1877
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,880
prevent competitive click fraud or any

1878
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,440
fraud in this complex system if not what

1879
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,840
else does fletch need and this is a

1880
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,480
question from bitul duroc

1881
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,679
oh actually i think we already asked

1882
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,040
that question

1883
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,320
okay

1884
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,640
then i can pick the second one here

1885
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,360
there is much less transparency on what

1886
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,520
happens on in-app advertising on the

1887
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,600
android platform is there any sharing

1888
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,159
between chrome and the google mobile ads

1889
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,719
sdk or will there be and this is a

1890
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,360
question from kevin mccurley

1891
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,159
yeah that is a great question uh as i

1892
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,080
said um there is uh uh

1893
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,920
the the app ecosystem is sort of a very

1894
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,800
different question um as of two months

1895
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,400
ago uh

1896
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,120
uh android announced that they are

1897
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,840
interested in the same privacy sandbox

1898
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,159
approach that uh that chrome has been

1899
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,239
talking about for i guess two or three

1900
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:35,679
years at this point um so things like

1901
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,080
fledge are of interest to android as

1902
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,400
well and they have the first drafts out

1903
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,199
of their attempts to take the same sort

1904
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,640
of uh uh privacy and on-device ad

1905
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,400
auction computation and user

1906
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,560
transparency story and make that

1907
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,560
available

1908
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,960
on android for for

1909
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,600
in-app ads as well um that doesn't

1910
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,080
completely answer the question of

1911
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,080
is there going to be information sharing

1912
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,960
of some sort between privacy sandbox

1913
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,880
inside the web browser and privacy

1914
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,199
sandbox on the apps even if they both

1915
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,480
adopt the same

1916
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,159
uh you know the same approach there are

1917
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,360
sort of two different things and they

1918
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,880
might share data with one another or

1919
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,719
they might not i don't have the answer

1920
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,080
to that right now i mean i think that

1921
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,360
there's going to be different privacy

1922
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,400
properties

1923
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,920
really this kind of gets to uh

1924
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,960
like

1925
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,840
what people's idea of privacy is right

1926
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,960
and and the question of whether privacy

1927
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,760
is

1928
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,800
i mean privacy is definitely

1929
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,360
contextually dependent right the the you

1930
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,120
know a lot of privacy violation comes

1931
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,000
from taking data from one context and

1932
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
using it on you know contrary to

1933
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,679
people's expectations in a different

1934
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,199
context and to some extent this chrome

1935
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:49,280
versus android question gets to the

1936
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,880
heart of what do you think the right

1937
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,920
context is like there are absolutely

1938
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,320
people who think that a context is this

1939
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,080
physical object here that i'm holding in

1940
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,719
my hand right this phone is the context

1941
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,480
and so drawing a distinction between

1942
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,880
what happens in chrome on this phone and

1943
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,840
in a non-chrome app on the same phone is

1944
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,120
like an artificial distinction that

1945
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,880
doesn't make sense and there are people

1946
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,239
on the other side who think that no

1947
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,920
actually chrome and web are totally

1948
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,760
different from each other i mean chrome

1949
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,120
and app are totally different from each

1950
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,080
other they should have nothing to do

1951
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,080
with each other at all um those people

1952
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,920
tend to be more technologists the people

1953
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,760
who think that the right uh

1954
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,159
scope is the device tend to be users who

1955
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,199
actually can't tell the difference

1956
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,640
between whether they're using chrome or

1957
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,040
using an app um i i think the answer to

1958
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,199
this is something that i will know uh

1959
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,480
two or three years from now and that i

1960
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,120
really don't know now

1961
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,719
great thank you michael this is i think

1962
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,239
this this topic is going to keep our

1963
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,480
community busy now for uh for many many

1964

1982
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,480
as you saw from the title is a bit

1983
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,840
different it's not a technical session

1984
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,400
and it's about publication and i'm yeah

1985
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,080
i would like to thank the organizers for

1986
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,679
the opportunity to discuss this here

1987
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,640
since you guys are all by attending rwc

1988
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,199
members of the iacr for next year and we

1989
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,679
now finally have a large crowd of people

1990
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,199
gathered again we thought it would be

1991
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,239
great

1992
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,960
to

1993
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,080
have a discussion about this

1994
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,239
about publication venues

1995
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,640
uh what the icr wants and something we

1996
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,800
have been working on for now some time

1997
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,560
and we'd like to have a discussion about

1998
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,679
this

1999
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,760
about the pros and the cons and what at

2000
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,040
least the folks here in the room but

2001
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,120
maybe also on zoom

2002
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
think about it such that we can take

2003
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,960
this into consideration

2004
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,280
so maybe for the folks who are not

2005
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,600
that familiar with the icr and with

2006
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,679
publication let me give

2007
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,280
a quick summary and how i would like to

2008
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,480
do this so i

2009
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,400
give a summary what we do now what we

2010
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,760
have been doing in the last couple years

2011
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,239
i hope to be done in like 10 minutes and

2012
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,840
then let's open up for uh for a large

2013
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,199
discussion so i think that is that is

2014
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,199
how i would like to approach this

2015
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,280
so the icr has three

2016
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,560
uh main conferences so eurocrypt crypto

2017
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,920
and asia crypt

2018
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,719
they have um when you go to the you

2019
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,239
publish a paper you present it at the

2020
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,239
conference and the paper is published

2021
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,040
with springer in lncs

2022
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,640
then we have four

2023
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,440
area conferences

2024
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,880
so tcc pkc chess and fse

2025
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,000
if you submit a paper now to chess or

2026
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,040
fse

2027
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,120
actually they moved to a journal

2028
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,880
conference hybrid so they have these

2029
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,719
transactions

2030
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,159
which are hosted by the university of

2031
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,440
bochum

2032
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,360
and they're completely open

2033
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,400
and if you

2034
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,440
publish with tcc or pkc your paper just

2035
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,000
as with the the main conferences

2036
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,760
gold are being published with springer

2037
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,960
then of course

2038
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,000
we have

2039
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,320
the journal the journal of cryptology

2040
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,920
which is published by springer so that

2041
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,880
is

2042
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,320
aimed for our best work at the icr

2043
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,120
then of course we have rwc where we are

2044
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,520
now there are no publications there are

2045
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,880
presentations

2046
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
for our community and then of course we

2047
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,440
have eprint so eprint is our online

2048
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,760
platform where everybody can submit

2049
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,600
their papers

2050
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,320
and there is no peer review process as

2051
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,840
long as it's not

2052
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,400
a random pdf which since i'm also one of

2053
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
the co-editors of eprint i'll try to

2054
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,400
reject

2055
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,159
more or less anything else which crypto

2056
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,760
related just gets in because i will not

2057
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,719
read all these papers

2058
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,760
so

2059
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,280
what are we talking about here so i

2060
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,960
think on the one hand and then we can

2061
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,120
open that up for the discussion is

2062
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,199
where do we see ourselves and with we i

2063
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:20,159
mean the icr in let's say 10 years in

2064
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,159
terms of publications i think this is

2065
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:22,880
more

2066
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,199
a philosophical question do we want to

2067
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:28,400
remain with springer do we want to have

2068
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,320
models like these transactions do we

2069
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,239
want to host everything ourselves so

2070
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,440
this is something you can think about

2071
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,520
now and maybe in 10 minutes during the

2072
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,159
discussion you can comment on

2073
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,679
but first i would like to talk a bit

2074
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,120
about a proposal which um the board of

2075
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,080
so the board of the icr received uh in

2076
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,239
mid 2020

2077
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,840
and you can see the authors listed here

2078
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,199
so it was

2079
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,000
a proposal by paolo breto senior camara

2080
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,440
michael nerik elizabeth also welcome

2081
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,840
western part and nigel smart and then it

2082
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,080
was endorsed by quite a number of other

2083
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,679
people from our community

2084
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,679
to create a new journal and i will in

2085
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,080
the next couple slides outline why they

2086
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,960
thought

2087
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,199
we needed to create this new journal

2088
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,800
and why this was needed and what in the

2089
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,880
meantime has been done

2090
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,880
then the board took this up

2091
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,199
and decided to investigate what is

2092
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,280
possible and what not and

2093
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,760
yeah i volunteered because i really like

2094
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,600
this proposal i volunteered to actually

2095
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,600
chair this this committee showing that's

2096
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,600
why i'm talking about it here right now

2097
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,920
so what was the main motivation for this

2098
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,280
new journal

2099
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,640
so again this was not something the

2100
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,480
board came up with this were members

2101
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,400
from our community

2102
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,159
who came to the board and they said yeah

2103
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:41,920
we see that there are a number of

2104
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,520
problems which how we publish things

2105
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,280
right now

2106
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,360
so if you've ever published in any of

2107
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,280
our venues you probably

2108
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,560
know how it works

2109
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,000
if you have you might have a very

2110
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,840
exciting new result you submit to

2111
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,199
eurocrypt

2112
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,520
it's a bit of a lottery if you get in

2113
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,960
if you do not get in you resubmit to

2114
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,800
crypto you might not get in you resubmit

2115
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,320
to asia crypt and then

2116
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,920
you do this multiple times until your

2117
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,199
paper gets in

2118
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,440
so this is of course very frustrating

2119
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,719
because you think your paper is really

2120
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,400
good and it deserves to get in the first

2121
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,080
time so for the authors it's very

2122
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,679
frustrating but it's of course also very

2123
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,679
frustrating for the reviewers because

2124
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,719
every conference has their own large pc

2125
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:20,400
and this paper needs to get reviewed

2126
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,400
over and over again so it wastes simply

2127
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,960
a lot of time

2128
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,080
this is of course because our field is

2129
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,679
growing crypto is growing which is a

2130
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,600
good thing but we only have a limited

2131
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,440
number of slots at our conferences

2132
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,280
so as a result like i said there's

2133
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,360
there's some frustration and people are

2134
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,600
resubmitting people are

2135
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,360
hyping their claims in their paper to

2136
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,400
convince reviewers hoping that if the

2137
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,840
paper looks more sexy it does get in

2138
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,239
and it also means that a lot of students

2139
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,159
in order to get their results published

2140
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:56,080
need to travel to various places in the

2141
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,320
world because if you publish somewhere

2142
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,840
you need to present your paper

2143
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,120
and conferences might become dull just

2144
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,360
by only presenting scientific results

2145
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,800
and not the cool stuff i mean that is

2146
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,400
one of the reasons why we have real

2147
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,320
world crypto where we don't have the

2148
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,679
more technical papers they're here as

2149
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,000
well but the main selection criteria

2150
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,679
here is to select the cool stuff which

2151
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,560
is happening out there

2152
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,480
so the proposal is let's try and fix

2153
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,400
these perceived problems and indeed we

2154
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,159
can open up later if you agree or

2155
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,080
disagree with these perceived problems

2156
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,320
by creating a new journal which try to

2157
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,760
addresses this

2158
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,400
so some of the features this new journal

2159
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,239
should have is that it should be diamond

2160
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,560
or gold to open access

2161
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,719
so it should be free people should just

2162
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,880
be should be able to access

2163
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,480
all the papers for free

2164
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,920
um and it should have a fast and

2165
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,639
consistent turnaround time meaning that

2166
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,159
once you submit you would like to have

2167
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,679
your decision within let's say three

2168
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,120
months

2169
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,199
such that it allows to scale for our

2170
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,760
community so when the community grows we

2171
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,960
expect more people uh submit papers

2172
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,920
and then

2173
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,239
um yeah with the current

2174
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,679
uh how we currently deal with the

2175
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,480
conferences um yeah this is not not a

2176
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,719
scalable approach

2177
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,520
as

2178
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,520
moreover we want to respect all areas in

2179
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,120
crypto so of course we now have our

2180
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,320
three generic uh conferences and then we

2181
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,800
have our four area conferences but we

2182
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,960
have of course much more areas in crypto

2183
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,960
besides the four area conferences and

2184
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,639
how should we deal with that

2185
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,600
um so the idea was this journal

2186
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,159
would be the venue if you

2187
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,440
for instance have a real world crypto

2188
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,560
paper you can submit to this journal

2189
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,560
so it's another outlet for our community

2190
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,800
to publish

2191
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,320
and of course very important it should

2192
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,159
not compete with any of these other

2193
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,400
venues it should complement so it's just

2194
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,360
another publication venue

2195
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,320
and then the whole ideology is here that

2196
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,719
since we want to avoid this competition

2197
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,960
making your paper look extra sexy

2198
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,600
if your paper is relevant to crypto and

2199
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,040
it is correct

2200
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,080
um

2201
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,280
then it should just get in so not

2202
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,719
we want to avoid all these discussions

2203
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,840
so which is more important or

2204
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,760
we now already have 10 papers on

2205
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,040
symmetrically

2206
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,159
um

2207
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,760
we are going to reject some because

2208
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,760
otherwise that session will be too large

2209
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,520
et cetera we want to avoid

2210
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,400
of these discussions

2211
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,320
so let me because we now had and i will

2212
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,480
skip a lot of the details we talked to a

2213
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,239
lot of publishers

2214
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,080
and how we could approach things in

2215
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,600
practice because it's of course when you

2216
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,600
want to embark upon something like this

2217
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,280
it's much more difficult

2218
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,320
um

2219
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
our goal was that of course when you

2220
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,560
submit a paper it's free when you access

2221
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,239
the paper it's free and then of course

2222
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,560
there is a cost associated

2223
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,400
with it and somehow and that are the

2224
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,719
details we still need to figure out

2225
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,960
it it would cost the icr money and our

2226
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
goal was for this diamond open access

2227
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,679
that it would cost less than a hundred

2228
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,199
dollars per paper

2229
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,199
so when you look around to see if this

2230
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,199
is realistic just that people are aware

2231
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,800
of this

2232
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,400
here are some some

2233
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,960
numbers for diamond open access or gold

2234
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,199
open access which publishers actually

2235
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,159
charge

2236
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,560
and then you see that um a hundred

2237
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,199
dollars per paper is ridiculously low

2238
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,760
um but we think that that we are able to

2239
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,400
do it but as you can see what other in

2240
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,960
in related communities uh publishers

2241
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,639
charge um yeah it goes from a thousand

2242
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,360
to multiple thousand dollars per paper

2243
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,800
so then yeah we had a look how can we do

2244
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,480
this in practice so

2245
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,960
we decided to subdivide the task into

2246
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,920
three so we need the solution for the

2247
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,159
submission and reviewing system so if

2248
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,639
you have ever been on a pc

2249
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,480
you know so some conferences use easy

2250
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,320
chair for instance

2251
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,960
ojs so the open journal system

2252
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,239
if you've been on the pc for for chess

2253
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,440
or for fse they use hot crap

2254
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,280
so there are a bunch of requirements and

2255
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,280
we were investigating what could we use

2256
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,199
and what not then the second step of

2257
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:10,080
course

2258
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,360
after a paper is reviewed and you decide

2259
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,480
which ones

2260
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,199
do we want to want to accept and

2261
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,520
put in the journal then of course you

2262
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,320
need to create the final versions

2263
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,760
and that actually takes a significant

2264
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,159
amount of time i also do not think that

2265
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,239
many people are aware of this but when

2266
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,000
we spoke for instance to the folks

2267
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,360
behind

2268
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,880
teaches

2269
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,480
and tusk

2270
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,239
which is hosted in baltimore

2271
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,440
then

2272
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,199
there are phd students there and it

2273
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:42,320
takes them on average one hour per final

2274
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,880
version of a paper to create and or

2275
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,480
check that everything is in order so

2276
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,880
this is actually a significant amount of

2277
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,639
time and of course does not does not

2278
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,320
scale if our community grows

2279
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,239
and then there's a problem of course if

2280
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,080
you want to get indexed and recognized

2281
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,080
as a proper journal you need to collect

2282
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,080
all kinds of metadata such that you get

2283
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,239
indexed

2284
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,840
by by various external

2285
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,800
entities and then of course the last

2286
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,960
step is the hosting system

2287
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,840
so

2288
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,280
do we want to do this ourselves do we

2289
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,360
want to talk to external publishers and

2290
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,120
pay them such that they take care of

2291
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,679
this if they take care of this how do we

2292
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,280
move

2293
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,120
from step two to step three et cetera et

2294
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,719
cetera so in the last year we looked

2295
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,400
into all these steps

2296
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,280
and we made a proposal um yeah what is

2297
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,880
possible what's not and what are roughly

2298
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,199
the costs

2299
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:36,000
and so in february this year after a

2300
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,760
discussion in the board

2301
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,840
we agreed that we would continue to

2302
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,120
investigate

2303
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,800
and look into this new journal to try

2304
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,199
and create it

2305
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,199
just so everything looks very similar as

2306
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,920
to with the transactions so use hot crap

2307
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,199
for the submission and reviewing

2308
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,520
software

2309
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,639
the editing

2310
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,639
for now then we would still do similar

2311
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,800
to the transactions but we will work

2312
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,520
will form a committee and look how we

2313
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,920
can automate this as much as possible

2314
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,600
such that also the transactions can

2315
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,040
benefit from this

2316
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,120
and it was decided to do the hosting

2317
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,360
step ourselves such that the icr is in

2318
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,440
control fully in control over their own

2319
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,159
publications

2320
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,840
so of course this is just a proposal and

2321
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,920
then of course the goal is to present

2322
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,760
this full proposal

2323
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,600
when it is there hopefully by the end of

2324
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,440
this year or maybe early next year and

2325
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,400
then

2326
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,000
present this to the membership that is

2327
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,600
you but also

2328
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,520
much wider of course

2329
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,920
to all the icr members and i'll have a

2330
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,840
vote on it if we think that it's a good

2331
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,560
idea to have this new journal or not

2332
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,920
so i really would like to stress of

2333
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,600
course that once we do this we would

2334
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,840
like that as many people as possible

2335
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,000
actually vote on this so we will make

2336
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,080
some noise and try to make some

2337
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,360
more uh

2338
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,960
yeah

2339
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,480
advertisement for it when the time is

2340
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,639
there

2341
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,960
so then don't read all this hopefully

2342
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,800
these slides will come on the rwc

2343
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
website then you can can read this in

2344
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,440
more detail but i would have two slides

2345
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,159
with with an faq questions many people

2346
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,920
when i discussed it also here in in the

2347
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,840
breakout room have asked me

2348
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,040
um and i already would like to answer it

2349
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,040
here such that we have more time for a

2350
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,400
useful discussion

2351
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,159
so of course many people are so what is

2352
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,280
the impact on and then of course um are

2353
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,000
our main venues the transactions or and

2354
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,080
a very good question on other crypto

2355
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,040
venues which are not necessarily icr

2356
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,280
organized venues so let me briefly

2357
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,400
answer them

2358
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,679
so

2359
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,480
eurocrypt asia crypt and crypto

2360
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,840
we really see this new journal as an

2361
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,159
additional venue which tries to decouple

2362
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,159
going to a conference and presenting

2363
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:47,520
your work there

2364
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,040
and publishing

2365
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,679
so when you go to

2366
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,360
chess or

2367
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,679
or any of our conferences the goal is

2368
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,719
also to talk to people to network

2369
01:28:58,719 --> 01:28:59,440
so

2370
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,040
this new journal will not take anything

2371
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,679
away from this

2372
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,360
so

2373
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,400
of course as you saw the this new how we

2374
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,000
set this new journal up it's very close

2375
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,239
to the transactions

2376
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,800
so how will this impact the transactions

2377
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,440
we really believe that the transactions

2378
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,000
so djs and tusks will be the number one

2379
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,040
venues

2380
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,480
for chess and for fsc there might of

2381
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,320
course be just related papers submitted

2382
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,840
to this new journal or fsc related

2383
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,080
papers submitted to this new journal but

2384
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,480
the number one venue would still be the

2385
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,920
transactions

2386
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,040
i mean

2387
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,719
we actually believe that

2388
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,320
it was perceived that the impact on

2389
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,800
these smaller conferences uh

2390
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
on the border of the icr so the in

2391
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,040
cooperation with uh the impact there is

2392
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,880
much more severe so think about sag

2393
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,520
africa crypt in the crypt latin crypt

2394
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,360
if such a new journal would be there it

2395
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,920
might actually take away submissions to

2396
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,440
these conferences

2397
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,800
which would be bad and of course we want

2398
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,520
to minimize a negative impact on the

2399
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,520
crypto community as a whole

2400
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,679
so we had a conversation with many of

2401
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,520
the people behind these conferences and

2402
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,760
we proposed the idea that

2403
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,760
they could then organize

2404
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,320
their conferences and that will then get

2405
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,800
published as a special issue in this new

2406
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,560
journal and they actually really like

2407
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,480
this idea and

2408
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,920
it would also be a way for them to

2409
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,080
actually get more submissions

2410
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,239
and papers which get in there of course

2411
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,520
would then get

2412
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,520
presented at these local conferences

2413
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,199
another question which is asked

2414
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,920
frequently is why not simply move all

2415
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,239
your area conferences to the transaction

2416
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,080
model

2417
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,440
so i think that is that is an

2418
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,880
interesting question by itself so that

2419
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,560
was not something this committee was

2420
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,080
tasked to do

2421
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,080
and that is also not something we as the

2422
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,040
icr board can just tell these people to

2423
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,560
do so

2424
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,159
all our

2425
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,760
sub communities have their own steering

2426
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,960
committees and they have their own

2427
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,639
autonomy to decide whatever they want to

2428
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,719
do

2429
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,800
so although they could all move to the

2430
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,320
transaction model it would not solve all

2431
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
the problems i outlined a couple slides

2432
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,280
back

2433
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,159
because there are simply much more areas

2434
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,639
in crypto than the four area conferences

2435
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,320
we have

2436
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,920
for instance if you have work which is

2437
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,600
very practical it relates to real world

2438
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,400
crypto to which area conference would

2439
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,840
you submit

2440
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,600
so

2441
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,440
i think there's a gap and this journal

2442
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,280
would fill that gap

2443
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,560
and then of course the question is why

2444
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,719
not simply change or adapt the journal

2445
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,159
of crypto because we already have a

2446
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,080
journal at the iecr

2447
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,159
and there um yeah we really believe the

2448
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,239
journal of crypto is intended for the

2449
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:41,520
highest quality the best papers we have

2450
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,360
and that is not the goal of this

2451
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,080
new journal the goal of this new journal

2452
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,320
is really to ensure that we as a

2453
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,800
community that we allow

2454
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,320
to scale in the future

2455
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,719
have many papers

2456
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,719
and also for people who actually do not

2457
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,400
want to travel and present their work

2458
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,520
provide them with an alternative outlet

2459
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:06,400
yeah to publish their work in a journal

2460
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,000
if you have any comments you can always

2461
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,679
reach the committee at newjournal

2462
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,120
icr.org

2463
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,719
maybe before we start off a discussion

2464
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,639
about a new journal or about publication

2465
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:17,840
in general

2466
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,880
i would be very curious to see how many

2467
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,480
people think it's a good idea to have

2468
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,320
this new journal so maybe we can do just

2469
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,719
an informal raise of hands so who would

2470
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,159
be informal

2471
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,519
in favor of the new journal

2472
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,400
all right and who would be against

2473
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,600
nobody okay can you comment because

2474
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,560
people yeah so in favor was

2475
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,800
uh i would say 60 70 percent of the room

2476
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,960
and against whilst nobody

2477
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,960
so i guess the other 30

2478
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,880
is indifferent they don't know yet which

2479
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,040
is perfectly fair

2480
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,310
or they are asleep yes

2481
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:58,880
[Music]

2482
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,199
good then let's open up yeah come to the

2483
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,600
mic if you have an opinion on this

2484
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,199
so i'm not the only one answering your

2485
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,960
questions we have other people here in

2486
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,719
the room who were actually

2487
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,480
the original authors of this proposal so

2488
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,760
they can answer

2489
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,760
definitely questions as well so indeed

2490
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,320
this is a discussion

2491
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,719
so again questions about the new journal

2492
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,639
your opinion if you think this is a good

2493
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,960
idea a

2494
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,800
yeah helena okay i will read a question

2495
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,159
in zulu from dan bernstein

2496
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:32,080
if authors will still be submitting the

2497
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,679
papers that they think are good to

2498
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,159
eurocrypt asia crypt and crypto then how

2499
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,400
will the stated problems for the authors

2500
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,560
and reviewers be addressed by the

2501
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,960
existence of another journal for the

2502
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,440
papers that authors don't think are good

2503
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,000
i've seen heyon let me scroll

2504
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
i've seen this question asked a few

2505
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,239
times before and have not seen an answer

2506
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,440
so i'm not sure if i get the question

2507
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,480
the question is

2508
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,960
if people still submit their papers to

2509
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,719
our main conferences

2510
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:01,600
um

2511
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,360
how would we solve them yeah the

2512
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,280
perceived problem so i guess

2513
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,360
maybe put differently are there no

2514
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,360
changes to these three conferences

2515
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,199
because i think that's the basic problem

2516
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,440
right

2517
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:14,400
so

2518
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,600
i don't know if that's the basic problem

2519
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,400
but

2520
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,320
to answer your question no we will so

2521
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,159
that we will not change anything to our

2522
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:21,679
our main conferences we will not change

2523
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,760
anything to our area conferences this is

2524
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,639
about

2525
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,719
adding another publication outlet so we

2526
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,040
would change nothing there and maybe to

2527
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,280
to answer then so if i understood this

2528
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,960
question correctly

2529
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,800
so how it would

2530
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,679
solve things in in my opinion is to

2531
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,719
since more it takes some papers out of

2532
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:41,679
the queue

2533
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,480
for eurocrypt asia crypt and crypto

2534
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,400
and hopefully

2535
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,560
that would then release the stress a bit

2536
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,239
uh the refueling stress on the pc's

2537
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:51,520
there

2538
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,000
so it would solve some of the problems

2539
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
we see at eurocrypt asia krypton crypto

2540
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,159
today hopefully hopefully yes of course

2541
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,360
only time will tell yes okay

2542
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,920
so if i am keeping my good papers for

2543
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,760
eurocrypts and whatever does that mean

2544
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,840
this journal will have a particularly

2545
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,679
low impact and

2546
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:11,679
be somewhere where if you're an academic

2547
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,040
you actually wouldn't want to publish

2548
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,400
because then you need to publish ten

2549
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,080
times as much

2550
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,719
yeah i see nigel would like to answer

2551
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,360
okay to clarify that okay so

2552
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,679
um

2553
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,320
a number of people in the community

2554
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,480
can't travel to crypto europe in asia or

2555
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,080
travel at all we have a large number of

2556
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,600
people who can't travel because of visas

2557
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,560
we have a large number of people who

2558
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,600
can't travel because they're looking

2559
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,360
after kids you have a lot of people

2560
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,119
looking after old people so there's a

2561
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,400
large group of people who don't want to

2562
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,440
travel

2563
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,880
at

2564
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,360
the last physical real world crypto i

2565
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,199
think it was the last discard lost track

2566
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,679
of two years there was a large group of

2567
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,760
very young members of railroad crypto

2568
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,080
who wanted to actually get rid of all

2569
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,159
the traveling to publish papers because

2570
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,600
they don't want to travel because they

2571
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,560
are against traveling for climate we

2572
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,679
have um if you're a european researcher

2573
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,639
getting funded by europe now you have to

2574
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,600
pay

2575
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,600
for open access whether it's with

2576
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,960
springer plus pay to go to the

2577
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,040
conference plus play the travel so these

2578
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,199
you know traveling and expenses this is

2579
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,480
killing a large number of people

2580
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,320
traveling so a lot of people

2581
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,760
will not want to travel to go to

2582
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,360
conferences and it was

2583
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,480
we now have far more people in the in

2584
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,560
the community than we had before

2585
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,520
if we scaled crypto and europe and asia

2586
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,840
crypt to the scale of the current

2587
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,639
uh

2588
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,719
size of the community we would have five

2589
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,880
or six tracks

2590
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,719
which is possible but it puts the price

2591
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,960
up have you seen the price of ccs

2592
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,679
it's like mad yeah so

2593
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,520
it will not so the whole point of this

2594
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,199
is this scales so if people want to want

2595
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:48,960
to go to crypto your crypt

2596
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,440
fine quite frankly i don't want to go

2597
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,520
anymore

2598
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,520
i've been to santa barbara enough um

2599
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,520
and i prefer a conference where we saw

2600
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,600
we curate the talks rather than just

2601
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,560
there's some

2602
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,920
academic

2603
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,440
who can piss the furthest to get their

2604
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,119
paper published

2605
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:10,560
um so the idea is is that papers it

2606
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,320
won't necessarily take the worst papers

2607
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,639
there still will be a standard

2608
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,880
so it still will be you know are you

2609
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,440
saying i'm sorry

2610
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,520
so if you say a paper is not a crypto in

2611
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,840
eurocrypt does that mean it's

2612
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,199
i don't think so because that would like

2613
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,920
be bad for pkc papers or sac papers or

2614
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,480
ctrsa papers so this there will be

2615
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,679
there's a level people you don't have to

2616
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,440
compete with others you don't have to

2617
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,199
sit as a phd student waiting for two

2618
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:40,800
years for one paper to be published

2619
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,480
because all the referees say it's

2620
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,679
accepted it's acceptable but it's not as

2621
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,679
nice or cool as trendy as all the other

2622
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,440
ones are accepted so it's just basically

2623
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,280
to take stuff out the queue so i

2624
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,760
wouldn't say anything about the standard

2625
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,520
the standard

2626
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,320
is basically set by the community it

2627
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,080
might turn out that people think this

2628
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,679
journal is better than crypto eurocrypt

2629
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,840
in the end but that's not for us to

2630
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
decide that's the community decide where

2631
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,800
people citation citing it's another

2632
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,880
outlet that's different and allows is

2633
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,280
more inclusive allows other things

2634
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,520
and for example allows real crypto

2635
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,520
papers or blockchain papers or

2636
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,480
what's the other thing i'm not

2637
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,400
steganography papers what's the other

2638
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,719
thing i'm not allowed to say

2639
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,719
no

2640
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,199
so maybe still on that topic so

2641
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:38,320
what i'm wondering a bit um

2642
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,119
if we say we want this to be orthogonal

2643
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:44,239
from publishing at say eurocrypt and so

2644
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,639
on wouldn't that also mean that we

2645
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,400
should allow to have papers that are

2646
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,560
accepted in a journal to still publish

2647
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,800
them at eurocrypt and then maybe also

2648
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,400
set a certain

2649
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,480
amount of places in europe where say we

2650
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,320
will take this many papers from the

2651
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,880
journal to a couple encourage publishing

2652
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,719
there which for eurocrypt i would

2653
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,239
imagine would have the advantage that

2654
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,239
those papers have already been peer

2655
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,000
reviewed so

2656
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,239
the committee could probably just limit

2657
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:11,920
themselves to considering is this

2658
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,360
impressive enough but they wouldn't have

2659
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,080
to worry about is this correct

2660
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,159
and i feel this would solve some of the

2661
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,400
issues that people uh here keep

2662
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,080
complaining about

2663
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,840
yeah so that is definitely an

2664
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,760
interesting thought and that comes much

2665
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,520
closer i don't know with people here

2666
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,679
remember of a proposal by nigel and

2667
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,760
others from from

2668
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,320
from 2011 which is more or less what

2669
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,400
you're describing now

2670
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,000
and that never made it so there was

2671
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,119
quite some

2672
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,119
support but also quite some

2673
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:44,000
pushback from the community so that

2674
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,840
yeah never made it and

2675
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,760
so that is not this new journal this new

2676
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,760
journal will not change anything about

2677
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,880
crypto azure crypt in europe

2678
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,719
papers who appeared there

2679
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:55,520
will

2680
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,199
not appear in the new journal because

2681
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,719
then it has already been published

2682
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:01,360
somewhere else and vice versa a paper in

2683
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,119
the new journal

2684
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,760
will not be presented or published at

2685
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,639
any other icr venue

2686
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,679
so

2687
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,760
some people also write code when they do

2688
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,320
crypto research and that has

2689
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,400
traditionally not very

2690
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,960
paper is not very friendly to to code as

2691
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,400
a lot of people know

2692
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,800
so has artifact evaluation been

2693
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,040
considered in this context

2694
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,880
yeah i think that's actually a very good

2695
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,000
point so

2696
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,719
as you might note in for djs there are

2697
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,400
artifact submissions and they're being

2698
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,159
reviewed

2699
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,280
i also

2700
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,239
strongly support this

2701
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,000
we have not discussed this as part of

2702
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,440
the new journal but i think that is

2703
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,280
actually a very good remark which we

2704
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,080
should

2705
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,679
do and i think that that makes a lot of

2706
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,480
sense yeah

2707
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,600
so in the opposite direction to what

2708
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,040
gentleman in front of

2709
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,159
said instead of elevating uh would it

2710
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,480
for reviewers be being optioned

2711
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,000
when something is

2712
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,480
submitted to one of the main conferences

2713
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,760
to say

2714
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,880
not here

2715
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,440
but it is a good paper we send it on to

2716
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:17,159
the other journal automatically

2717
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,679
that's interesting

2718
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,239
because it would prevent it to be

2719
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,360
rejected and then resubmitted and

2720
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,400
re-evaluated because it's already

2721
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
evaluated

2722
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,239
it's seen as good it's not seen as

2723
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,040
top

2724
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,560
10

2725
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,239
why not immediately create that funnel

2726
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:42,400
yeah i think if we could manage to do

2727
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,480
this it would be very interesting but of

2728
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,360
course

2729
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,000
in practice because there will be

2730
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,520
yeah there is let's say for the main

2731
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,440
conference there's a pc and there will

2732
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,960
be an editorial board for the new

2733
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,000
journal which are probably disjoint so i

2734
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,760
think in practice this would be very

2735
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,960
very difficult but uh yeah

2736
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,719
it's yeah it's something we will

2737
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:05,840
definitely take up yeah

2738
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,159
so it seems here that we have a very

2739
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:15,119
vast majority in favor of this proposal

2740
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,520
two weeks ago i was at fsc and we had a

2741
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,440
similar session and there was a very

2742
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,679
strong majority against this proposal so

2743
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,600
how come that we have a divide in this

2744
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,199
community

2745
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,320
yeah that's actually a very good

2746
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,320
question

2747
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,040
so

2748
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,040
i think we had similar sessions yes

2749
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,440
there was a strong majority against and

2750
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,199
here there is strong majority in favor

2751
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,679
of exactly outcomes so so maybe to to

2752
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,639
summarize indeed so at fsc

2753
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:43,440
the

2754
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,920
this new journal was discussed without

2755
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,080
unfortunately any member of this new

2756
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,480
journal committee involved

2757
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:51,840
and there indeed there was a vast

2758
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,960
majority against creating this

2759
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,639
the question here why is are the

2760
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,080
opinions so so different um i think one

2761
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,719
um most importantly there's a lack of

2762
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,719
which is definitely to blame on us with

2763
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,360
on trying to communicate with fse

2764
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,360
because the strongest objections are

2765
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,600
coming from the fsc community i think

2766
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,880
their biggest

2767
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,440
fear is um also what they wrote they

2768
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,119
believe that this might pose a threat to

2769
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,520
their transactions so that more people

2770
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,960
will submit to this journal and it would

2771
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,440
harm their community or their

2772
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,080
tasks their transactions

2773
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,280
so i

2774
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,199
do not believe this i think fse and

2775
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,360
chess are both very strong venues by

2776
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,679
itself the transactions are really well

2777
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,719
established i think it's a big success

2778
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,320
so i do not think this new journal will

2779
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,800
pose a threat to that but yeah time will

2780
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,480
tell because like i said i think we

2781
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,159
should try to minimize

2782
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,400
that of course a negative impact on our

2783
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,920
communities that's including chess

2784
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,719
including fse

2785
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,119
so yeah why were people there much more

2786
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:54,719
negative i think

2787
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,119
we so we started talking to that

2788
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:58,560
community i was hoping there were more

2789
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,159
people from the community here so that

2790
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:01,840
they could voice

2791
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,920
their concerns and we could discuss it

2792
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,360
but we will definitely redo this

2793
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,400
exercise also yeah eurocrypt uh end of

2794
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,679
may

2795
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,760
to to hopefully people are then present

2796
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,920
there we can then yeah we can discover

2797
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,159
uh yeah why they are so against this

2798
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,520
right here

2799
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,480
um

2800
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,400
i'm looking at sulip so i'm just trying

2801
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,159
to voice what's being

2802
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,480
what's going on there it's not questions

2803
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,639
it's comments um

2804
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,840
so a comment from i believe

2805
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,080
on dan bernstein's earlier question i

2806
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,840
personally don't think that the papers i

2807
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,719
push to e-print are not good i nowadays

2808
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,719
tend to avoid the usual formal

2809
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,719
publication process because it is a

2810
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,960
source of delays and administrative

2811
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,520
frustration i also like to be able to go

2812
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,000
beyond the usual page limit if the new

2813
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,239
journal happens i will submit there and

2814
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,360
probably only there that's his comment

2815
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,080
um very nice yeah and then the second

2816
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,199
comment here from kevin mccurley

2817
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,880
i'm on the committee and i was an

2818
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,960
advocate for expanding the scope to

2819
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,320
reconsider the strategy of all icr

2820
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,800
publications for 20 years we've been

2821
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,880
hampered in our movement toward open

2822
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,000
access but we used eprint to skirt this

2823
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,800
issue i still think icr's publication

2824
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,040
plan is too fragmented

2825
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,040
okay yeah so that is a question maybe we

2826
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,600
can so that's a different question um

2827
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,199
what i said in the beginning so what do

2828
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,600
we think should the icr do in the long

2829
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,880
run so

2830
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,280
let's not forget about the new journal

2831
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,159
where do we see ourselves in 10 years 15

2832
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,000
years do we want to still be with

2833
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,320
springer for lots of our

2834
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,000
publication do we want to do everything

2835
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,480
ourselves or something else

2836
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,760
i think that is something we should all

2837
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,119
think about we don't have to answer that

2838
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:50,560
now it would be great if we could answer

2839
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,719
this now but uh

2840
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,560
yeah i agree it's a good question but a

2841
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,719
difficult question yeah

2842
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,800
so maybe the queue yeah

2843
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,880
i want to come back to the sub

2844
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,239
communities i think you said that the

2845
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:07,920
associated conferences latin crypt

2846
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,960
sac etc could want to use the journal

2847
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,600
for making special issues

2848
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,440
yes some yeah we spoke to all of them

2849
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,199
some were

2850
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,560
okay with it they thought it was a great

2851
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,400
idea and some indeed said that they

2852
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,719
think it would really benefit uh their

2853
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,800
community and have you thought of how

2854
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,280
this is gonna work in practice um are

2855
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,760
you gonna just uh whatever is accepted

2856
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,360
at the conferences goes in the journal

2857
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,880
and there is a special committee how do

2858
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,679
you do quality control for example to

2859
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,840
be sure that the quality of what comes

2860
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,239
from these special issues is in line

2861
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:41,920
with the quality expected from the

2862
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:42,960
journal

2863
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,199
so that's a good question so no we have

2864
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:46,719
not

2865
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:48,400
worked out all these details because we

2866
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,080
haven't even decided yet if this new

2867
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,199
journal would

2868
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,199
be there but that is indeed something we

2869
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,440
would need to work out with uh yeah with

2870
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,880
the the steering committees or the

2871
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,960
people behind these journals uh behind

2872
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,400
these uh conferences

2873
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,239
well regardless of whether we are

2874
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,040
getting this new journal or not

2875
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,080
the fundamental problem is not solved so

2876
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,480
the papers will come back to us to be

2877
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:15,840
reviewed

2878
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,320
so the load is the same as long as the

2879
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,440
good papers get accepted

2880
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,199
no because that's the whole point so

2881
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,800
papers which are now submitted to the

2882
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,760
new journal if they're good

2883
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,440
they get in so they get them reviewed

2884
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,840
once maybe of course with an iteration

2885
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:38,080
um if they are bad they get rejected

2886
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,239
um and then they are not allowed to to

2887
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:41,440
resubmit

2888
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,280
um while for

2889
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,880
yeah the main conferences you do this

2890
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,800
whole circus when you resubmit and

2891
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,600
resubmit and there are new pcs for your

2892
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,840
crypt asia crypto so then it's a lot of

2893
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,360
work which is being redone because

2894
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,960
reviews are not shared between the pcs

2895
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,840
but

2896
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,040
then

2897
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,719
why don't we just

2898
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,600
accept the papers and have some kind of

2899
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,880
indication

2900
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,960
of what nigel pointed out before like

2901
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,040
whether the authors want to travel or

2902
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:09,920
not

2903
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,480
and then just select the best papers or

2904
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,360
have the pc decide what is the catchy

2905
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,320
topic for the conference and still have

2906
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,560
the good papers i mean we know that

2907
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,280
papers get rejected from these venues

2908
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,480
with three accepts so

2909
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,239
so that is the fundamental problem so

2910
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:29,679
why don't we solve the fundamental

2911
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,199
problem regardless of whether we need

2912
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,679
another journal or not

2913
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:35,360
yeah so i i

2914
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,040
do believe that this approach has lots

2915
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,639
of benefits this comes back to the to

2916
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:39,920
the question we just answered this is

2917
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,679
more or less the proposal from 2011

2918
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,639
which we failed to to materialize at

2919
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:49,600
that point um but yeah i still do think

2920
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,000
that the new journal would

2921
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,960
solve

2922
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,719
the problems raised but indeed we can

2923
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,719
solve it in in many different ways what

2924
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,840
you're saying would solve it as well

2925
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,320
um but that that that was not now the

2926
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
the question or the

2927
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,239
proposal raised by the community so that

2928
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,400
we are investigating that proposal but

2929
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,320
maybe nigel do you want to say something

2930
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,840
please use the mic

2931
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,440
politics it's easier to do something new

2932
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,800
than change

2933
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,560
oh something that because people are

2934
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,719
invested in something in the past so

2935
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:23,599
they don't want to change your crypto

2936
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:25,920
oh sorry oh i have to do this right oh

2937
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,040
sorry

2938
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,080
okay

2939
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,520
i'll have to look at you and

2940
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,320
um

2941
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,199
people are invested in something

2942
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,960
that already exists so changing

2943
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,400
something that already exists is really

2944
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,400
really hard we tried this in 2011

2945
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,080
doesn't work so doing something new

2946
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,320
there's no vested interest so it's kind

2947
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,320
of it's more likely to succeed it's just

2948
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:50,400
it's just it's people are the problem

2949
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,119
okay i got one question here i think i

2950
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,000
was first yeah

2951
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
there's no way you could take over

2952
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,840
um okay from

2953
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,560
imat heydari benny there is a similar

2954
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,800
effort in the systems community and he

2955
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,199
gives a reference link

2956
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:09,280
they published the reviews as well is

2957
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,320
there any plan to do the same thing

2958
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,400
published reviews can potentially reduce

2959
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,239
the review load if papers get rejected

2960
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,800
yes so we of course spoke

2961
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,159
yeah because we've been looking at this

2962
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,040
for now over a year and we spoke to

2963
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,960
neighboring communities so

2964
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,280
pets for instance is exactly we had a

2965
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,800
discussion with them

2966
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,880
i think two weeks ago they're

2967
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,800
doing exactly the same thing they're

2968
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,159
trying to move away i want to create

2969
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:39,760
their own journal

2970
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,679
and wanted to learn from the icr our

2971
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:43,280
findings

2972
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,960
there are other communities especially

2973
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,239
for instance in machine learning where

2974
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,800
they have much more massive

2975
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,119
conferences allows for scalability they

2976
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,960
have indeed open reviews

2977
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,599
so we considered this but we decided for

2978
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:57,599
now at least for the short term that's

2979
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:59,199
not the path we want to want to take we

2980
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:01,199
can always change

2981
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,440
our strategy right if we

2982
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,239
grow

2983
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,080
or if the community decides we want to

2984
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,800
open reviews we can always do it but for

2985
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,960
now let's stick to what we already have

2986
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,880
and yeah let's not try to change too

2987
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,719
many things at the same time at the same

2988
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,639
time

2989
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:17,760
ben

2990
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,159
i've got um two comments and one

2991
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:21,119
question

2992
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,159
the first

2993
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,920
there's a lot of insistence that nothing

2994
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,599
will change for crypto asia crypt and

2995
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:28,320
eurocrypt which is a shame

2996
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,400
um

2997
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,040
anything that makes the conferences more

2998
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,119
interesting more interactive more

2999
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:37,760
environmentally friendly will be good

3000
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,760
um second

3001
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,599
is uh

3002
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,280
regional conferences anything that can

3003
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,040
help them i think is is a good thing

3004
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,400
because they're more accessible they

3005
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,639
sort of build a local community while

3006
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:49,840
you're waiting for the new journal

3007
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,480
there'll be a sac call for papers in the

3008
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,840
very near future and you should send all

3009
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,080
your good papers there

3010
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,320
uh and the question i guess is we talk

3011
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,840
about the conferences and we talk about

3012
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,719
the

3013
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,560
like the the specialist journals but the

3014
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,239
the thing that that i

3015
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:06,800
wasn't quite clear for me is um

3016
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,840
uh

3017
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,199
everyone here

3018
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:10,719
uh will tell you that they write

3019
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:12,800
excellent papers um

3020
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,119
how are they supposed to know whether

3021
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:16,960
their excellent paper is meant for

3022
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,280
journal of cryptology or journal of this

3023
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,400
one

3024
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,920
that that's just a distinction that

3025
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,520
wasn't really clear in the presentation

3026
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,440
for me yeah so i think that i've seen

3027
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,280
what nigel was saying so it is not clear

3028
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,239
right

3029
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:30,159
it is all your personal perception some

3030
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:32,320
people think fse

3031
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,320
for their paper is the best uh the

3032
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,639
highest tier venue other other people

3033
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,000
who think crypto is the highest tier

3034
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,119
venue

3035
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,800
other people think no you should go

3036
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,199
outside our community to use next or ccs

3037
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,440
it's it's all uh at your own personal

3038
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,040
perception and your choice where you

3039
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,719
submit your paper

3040
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:50,400
i just mean if i've got a great paper

3041
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:51,760
and i think it's in the middle of this

3042
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,480
community it's for everyone

3043
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,920
it's pretty good

3044
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,199
none of this right

3045
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,760
terrible stuff

3046
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,599
do we uh

3047
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:02,400
then

3048
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,480
yeah how do i know if it's a this paper

3049
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,159
or it's at that paper there's both

3050
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,360
supposed to be good journals they're

3051
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,280
both from the same place they've both

3052
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:12,960
got reasonable turnaround

3053
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,719
so i would say if you think if it's a

3054
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,480
generic crypto paper if you think it's

3055
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,920
the best of the best you should probably

3056
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:19,920
submit to journal of crypto

3057
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,960
if you have an area topic like fse or

3058
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,400
chess you should definitely go for the

3059
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,400
transactions they are really the best in

3060
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,599
their area

3061
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,599
if you have a paper

3062
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,080
about blockchain or any other thing

3063
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,960
which is not covered by the main air at

3064
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,400
the area conferences you can either

3065
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,080
submit to this new journal depends if

3066
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,520
you want to travel or not if you really

3067
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,840
want to present your work you can submit

3068
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,320
it to our uh to crypto asia crypt

3069
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,119
eurocrypt so

3070
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:48,800
i think that makes a lot of sense yeah

3071
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,119
thanks

3072
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,920
uh yeah so justin the idea to uh publish

3073
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,920
here papers that got three accepts in

3074
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,280
other conferences but they don't get

3075
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,800
because of quota

3076
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,119
uh i think it's a

3077
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:04,719
very good way of

3078
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:07,599
sorry you can't hear me okay so i think

3079
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:08,960
yeah that would really solve the

3080
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,520
problems of re-reviewing papers but

3081
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,920
i think there is still a concern because

3082
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,719
uh like nigel said the success of this

3083
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:18,560
paper will depend on how the community

3084
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,440
views it afterwards and so

3085
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:22,800
uh then

3086
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,239
like how do you know when you see

3087
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,239
someone published there was it's

3088
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:27,760
published in this journal because it

3089
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,520
wasn't good enough for

3090
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,360
uh these other conferences or because

3091
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,040
the water didn't want to travel or

3092
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:34,639
anything so just

3093
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:36,719
to make sure not to damage the

3094
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,400
the reputation of the paper in that way

3095
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,560
if you just get everyone from

3096
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,880
the bigger conferences yeah so only time

3097
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,560
will i guess only time will tell there

3098
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,159
right so i mean there are multiple

3099
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:47,520
outcomes how this can go it could be

3100
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,280
that only the

3101
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,920
lowest quality papers will get submitted

3102
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,639
to such a new journal and then indeed it

3103
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,480
might just collapse and might not be a

3104
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,360
success it might be that it gets

3105
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,960
submissions from

3106
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,360
yeah from all kinds of levels so it has

3107
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,719
on the same tier

3108
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,440
as a chess as a pkc as a tcc as a

3109
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,920
eurocrypt asia crypt but it comes from

3110
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,599
people who do not have the funds for

3111
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:13,520
instance to present their work and

3112
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,440
travel to that conference so i think

3113
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,960
that is our goal to try and solve that

3114
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,800
problem but only time will tell how it

3115
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,360
will turn out

3116
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,000
so my point picks up on the previous two

3117
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,679
points so i think

3118
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,599
um it's kind of like not good enough for

3119
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:31,360
it to depend on how it's going to turn

3120
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,199
out like consider that you're like a phd

3121
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,880
student now and you think you have a

3122
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,719
good paper and you know

3123
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:38,639
you and your co-authors think that so

3124
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,880
that's fine so you want to submit to

3125
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:43,199
the best place it can be and especially

3126
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:44,480
if like later down the line you're going

3127
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,000
to apply to a postdoc

3128
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
the wording of the job adverts is always

3129
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,719
you need top-tier publications

3130
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,080
so if we don't know how this journal is

3131
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,840
going to turn out then as a early career

3132
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,080
researcher you're not going to want to

3133
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,480
risk publishing here for it to turn out

3134
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,880
to be a low quality venue so we need to

3135
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,800
kind of maybe agree as a community that

3136
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,800
will be a good quality venue

3137
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,320
and just like make rather than me like

3138
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,920
oh we're fine if it doesn't turn out

3139
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,040
well because then you're not going to

3140
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,560
solve the problem if everyone wants to

3141
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,400
publish it like you're a crypto whatever

3142
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,599
because these are the ones that are seen

3143
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,199
as the best venues

3144
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:16,639
yeah i think that makes sense and i

3145
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,080
fully agree and i think of course this

3146
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,080
journal was not created we are not

3147
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,840
creating it by saying this will be a

3148
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,920
very low tier venue that is that is not

3149
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,760
the goal indeed yeah

3150
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,840
so i indeed if we can here now agree as

3151
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,760
a community that it would be a

3152
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,719
solid

3153
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,800
their venue i i fully support yeah

3154
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,760
hey

3155
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,199
um so

3156
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:41,599
i often hear from other

3157
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:44,000
young researchers in the field that they

3158
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,520
unfortunately have

3159
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,000
bad review experiences

3160
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,920
uh i think many people have had this so

3161
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,280
you get like

3162
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,679
i think it's a good paper and reviewer 1

3163
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,599
and 3 are very positive and reviewer 2

3164
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,840
hates it

3165
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,080
and it gets rejected and then some other

3166
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,400
conferences are accepted without any

3167
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,440
problems

3168
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,040
and i think this even happens between

3169
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,800
your crippling crypto in in either

3170
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,080
direction

3171
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:08,960
um

3172
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,360
you mentioned uh just now at your yeah

3173
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,960
the plan is okay you can submit to this

3174
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,560
journal and then you have two rounds and

3175
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,480
then if it's rejected it's it's out

3176
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,599
forever

3177
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,040
how would you avoid uh these like

3178
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,880
negative reviewer experiences that

3179
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,440
people have had in the past

3180
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,199
have you thought about implementing

3181
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,199
measures like this interactive rebuttal

3182
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:30,719
that we've now seen a few times are

3183
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,599
there can you say something about how we

3184
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,440
avoid these kinds of

3185
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,280
recurring things

3186
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,599
appearing and this just being a fourth

3187
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:42,320
venue that you can get unfairly rejected

3188
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,280
from

3189
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,360
yeah i think that's a it's a very good

3190
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,040
point and this of course was in the

3191
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,199
original proposal described in detail

3192
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,040
already some ideas and plans how to

3193
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,679
exactly deal with this so indeed

3194
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:54,960
we should try and learn from all the

3195
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,880
good things and mechanisms we have in

3196
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,239
our community to deal with this so

3197
01:57:58,239 --> 01:57:59,679
indeed the rebuttal was one so that

3198
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,040
would definitely

3199
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,199
just as we have for the transactions be

3200
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:05,360
part of it

3201
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,880
and yeah just as we see with a lot of

3202
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,560
other conferences you have to accept and

3203
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,960
one reject yeah you're out

3204
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,159
and here for the new journal then the

3205
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,080
question would be if you have to accept

3206
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,159
one reject so why is that the case so

3207
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,880
then indeed we need to have a mechanism

3208
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,599
in place to investigate why is there one

3209
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:22,960
clear reject

3210
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,040
does he know more or did he discover a

3211
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,599
flaw or is he simply wrong

3212
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:28,800
but how we're going to deal with this

3213
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,119
exactly in practice that would be

3214
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:32,560
one of the many things we still need to

3215
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,560
figure out after we decide if we want to

3216
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,639
create this new journal or not but uh

3217
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:37,840
yeah i

3218
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,599
fully agree with your point

3219
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,360
thank you

3220
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,639
okay my turn

3221
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:44,480
yeah go ahead

3222
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,280
just to say i don't think i can ask many

3223
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,520
more questions here but just to say

3224
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,199
afterwards you can go and check out the

3225
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:53,040
zulip online because now there's kind of

3226
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,119
a discussion going on here too so i'm

3227
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,800
not going to read everything and we'll

3228
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,320
just continue in the room and then

3229
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,040
please go check online uh because yeah

3230
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,199
is very active discussion going on now

3231
01:59:03,199 --> 01:59:04,480
yes already

3232
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:05,920
i want to apologize for the folks in

3233
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,360
zulip because we get the concert

3234
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,960
afterwards so i will not reply to all

3235
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,800
the chat messages immediately but i i

3236
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,080
will try and have a look this evening

3237
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:18,080
so uh um yeah so sorry because

3238
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,679
i'm going to get back to like a couple

3239
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:20,719
of

3240
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:22,719
questions that were already asked so it

3241
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,800
was like uh by timber staying on the

3242
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,679
chart and my left area here um

3243
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:30,000
so i get the idea of this new journal

3244
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,239
and all the kind of politics problems

3245
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,880
that were pointed out by nigel

3246
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,679
but is there anything stopping us from

3247
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,199
also trying to like bring back the 2011

3248
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,040
proposal because it's been 11 years

3249
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:46,400
right we it might work this time yeah so

3250
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,239
i mean nothing is preventing us from

3251
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:50,080
bringing the deck of course so that is

3252
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,239
it's simply not the task we were asked

3253
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:54,800
to investigate right now but it's it's i

3254
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,159
fully agree

3255
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,360
if

3256
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,760
the majority of our community is behind

3257
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,080
this then we should just do it uh yeah

3258
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,280
and we should investigate if it's

3259
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,920
feasible so yeah and i think nothing is

3260
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,719
stopping uh us from investigating um

3261
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:11,040
what's the formal procedure to do this

3262
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:12,880
send an email to the board to me or any

3263
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,960
other people on the board for instance

3264
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,040
the president is of course also

3265
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,880
the first person

3266
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,960
send him an email that you support

3267
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,880
investigating this and then

3268
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,239
it will be discussed at a board meeting

3269
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:25,840
and we decide if

3270
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,840
i guess we will then

3271
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,080
have a look but or talk there are many

3272
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,080
board members here present as well

3273
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,159
uh come to us

3274
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,080
you can just tell us and then we take

3275
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,000
note and we will take action

3276
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,760
okay like thanks because i think it

3277
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:42,080
keeps coming back right like yeah

3278
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:44,000
yeah i think yeah the same in 2011 there

3279
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,400
was strong support when i talk to people

3280
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,920
i always have the opinion that there is

3281
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,159
strong support for this but yeah it

3282
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:51,760
failed in 2011 because there was also a

3283
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,840
very strong opposition people don't like

3284
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:56,159
change or some parts of our community

3285
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:59,839
but maybe nigel you can clarify

3286
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:01,760
okay so it's really difficult because

3287
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,440
you've got lots of vested interests

3288
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:06,159
however one solution one

3289
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:07,760
possible don't tell anybody there's not

3290
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,920
many people here are they okay but one

3291
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,480
way of getting to the 2011 proposal is

3292
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,400
to have the new journal and then put

3293
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,800
your cryptasia krypton uh

3294
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,440
out of business

3295
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,960
but let me reiterate that is not our

3296
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,199
goal

3297
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,400
so although it might be nigel's goal it

3298
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,480
will not happen we will ensure of course

3299
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:34,839
that will not not be the case

3300
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,080
i i have one specific thing i want to

3301
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,520
comment on and i'm actually surprised

3302
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,080
nobody else brought it up so i don't

3303
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,560
believe in pay to publish i've never

3304
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,880
paid to publish in a journal i think it

3305
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,719
creates a perverse incentive because

3306
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,960
you'd be encouraged to accept more

3307
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,040
pay-per-view just to get more money

3308
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,880
because it was a hundred dollars yeah so

3309
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,440
that so i don't think that this hundred

3310
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,840
dollars is going to go to the phd

3311
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,360
student who's spending

3312
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:04,000
an hour of their time to yeah let me and

3313
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,320
then brian can clarify so maybe i i it

3314
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:09,440
was not clear we will not do pay

3315
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,800
to publish that's at least not the

3316
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,960
current proposal but can you show this

3317
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,520
yes it says it costs a hundred dollars

3318
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,840
it would be the cost for the icr it

3319
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,040
would not be the cost for the person uh

3320
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,480
submitting or accepting the paperwork

3321
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,920
brian please go ahead yeah let me

3322
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,920
address this i am not a member of the

3323
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,679
community but it's treasure the iacr of

3324
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:28,560
course

3325
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,280
it ultimately falls to me to figure out

3326
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,199
a viable funding model working with

3327
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:36,480
folks for that so the slide that yape

3328
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,639
had was showing what the cost would be

3329
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:40,320
to the iacr

3330
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,880
to what the goal was to publish right

3331
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:45,920
there's a cost that the iacr pays for

3332
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,840
all of our publications and our

3333
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,400
transactions they get those publications

3334
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,239
get funded out of the revenues of the

3335
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:54,159
iacr your membership fees go to pay for

3336
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:56,480
some of that any you know

3337
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,320
funds that come in over the cost of

3338
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,320
running conferences etc what is

3339
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,480
envisioned is that if this new journal

3340
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,199
proposal is approved that part and

3341
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:08,960
parcel of that proposal will be a

3342
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,280
funding model for the iacr's general

3343
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,040
funds to pay for that

3344
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,599
now as you all know if you've heard me

3345
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:17,440
if you've stayed around for a membership

3346
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:20,560
meeting at york crypto or agency

3347
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,159
and you know that i have to make a

3348
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:25,679
recommendation every year on fees it is

3349
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:27,920
possible that part of the funding model

3350
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:30,000
for this might include

3351
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,520
slightly increasing the 50 membership

3352
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,920
dues every year and that some of that

3353
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,679
might help to pay for this if it turns

3354
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:39,520
out that's a way to get to it another

3355
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,960
possible funding model would be to

3356
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,800
solicit sponsorships for this sort of

3357
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,080
event and we could actually go look at

3358
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:49,280
god help me advertising um but you know

3359
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:52,639
but but sponsorship for for that or it

3360
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:55,119
gets paid out of

3361
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:57,599
you know investment gains

3362
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,520
right there's a lot of different models

3363
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,520
we have for how we cover the expenses of

3364
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,679
the organization what

3365
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:05,920
no one wants to do is say it's a

3366
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,840
pay-to-play model and that you would

3367
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,560
have to pay some some page charge or

3368
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,480
submission charge for that right i

3369
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,719
strongly believe if this goes through it

3370
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:17,040
is an activity of the iacr and it gets

3371
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:19,920
funded just like we fund schools just

3372
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,840
like we fund fellows just like

3373
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,440
everything else out of the operations of

3374
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,599
the iacr and we budget for that and

3375
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:27,520
that's that's the answer

3376
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,880
yeah so it would work really the same

3377
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,719
now for journal of crypto there is a

3378
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:32,800
cost for every paper appearing there as

3379
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,679
well

3380
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:35,599
which of course i do think you may want

3381
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:37,440
to update your slide because it does

3382
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,040
seem to say that we need to pay to

3383
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,880
publish that is a very good point i will

3384
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,400
make that much much clearer yeah thanks

3385
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,159
i wanted to get back to sort of the

3386
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,719
impact factor discussion and

3387
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:50,400
maybe ask the room what they think the

3388
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,280
impact factor of icr eprint is

3389
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,520
because yeah that's how i usually get to

3390
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:58,800
papers i look something up on iciprint

3391
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,119
and then i oh it happens to be published

3392
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:04,880
in x or y or z

3393
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,639
it's up to the editors to make sure that

3394
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:09,119
they accept good papers and then the

3395
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:10,960
rest will follow but i think that a lot

3396
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,520
of people don't discover papers based on

3397
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,520
the impact factor of stuff so i don't

3398
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:19,040
really understand the problem

3399
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,280
yeah i can say something so somebody

3400
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,360
want to react i think discovering papers

3401
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,040
on eprint i think that is very good that

3402
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,119
is a nice part of our community such

3403
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:28,560
that people can get free access to

3404
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,840
papers

3405
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,119
but

3406
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:32,560
related to impact facts and other things

3407
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,560
for lots of academics so i'm from

3408
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,400
industry in industry i mean i don't care

3409
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,880
if my papers in a journal or

3410
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,599
wherever but for lots of people who want

3411
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:44,159
an academic job it needs to be published

3412
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:46,719
at a good journal indeed so then just

3413
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:48,320
having your paper on you print this is

3414
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,320
not sufficient yeah that that is true

3415
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,679
maybe we should also form a committee

3416
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:54,400
for those things

3417
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,679
i think we heard the concern

3418
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:00,320
that that this is

3419
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,639
going to be considered as i don't know a

3420
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:04,560
place where people want to publish it to

3421
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,040
especially from young researchers

3422
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,159
and so

3423
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:10,239
i think that the the more senior

3424
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:12,480
researchers maybe have or it would be

3425
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,679
nice if they would voluntarily commit to

3426
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,920
to submit to that such that others also

3427
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:20,000
have an incentive to that because right

3428
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,719
now i don't see any incentive other than

3429
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:25,920
being idealistic and just political and

3430
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,079
so i was one of the

3431
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:31,920
people from the group from rwc 2020 who

3432
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,599
were discussing that stuff and i think

3433
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:36,320
it's super important and right now i

3434
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:37,119
think

3435
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,880
everyone who is a young researcher want

3436
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,800
to stay in academia there is

3437
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,119
actually very little incentive to

3438
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:45,119
publish to their paper although i really

3439
02:06:45,119 --> 02:06:46,800
want to have something like that and

3440
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,239
these changes

3441
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:49,440
um

3442
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:53,280
like the 2011 proposal i think this is

3443
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,280
what would change something to let

3444
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,239
people

3445
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,239
publish to that thing so i think

3446
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:01,199
reiterating that thing and also maybe

3447
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:03,199
when senior researchers talk about that

3448
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:04,880
and try to come up with ideas

3449
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,280
voluntarily committing to

3450
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,639
submit to it or something like that

3451
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:09,520
would be

3452
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:11,599
i think very important for the success

3453
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:13,679
of that thing yeah i fully agree and we

3454
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:15,040
already discussed that within the

3455
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,119
committee that of course for the first

3456
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:19,360
couple of issues we need to ensure

3457
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,360
indeed that senior

3458
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,760
members of the community

3459
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,320
submit some papers there or invite them

3460
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:27,679
to submit some papers there such that

3461
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:29,199
indeed there's an incentive for the

3462
02:07:29,199 --> 02:07:30,159
others

3463
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:32,639
uh yeah to turn to this journal i fully

3464
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:34,880
agree

3465
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,520
okay we're starting to run out of time a

3466
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,599
little bit general check came in saying

3467
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:41,280
you know guys we need to start drinking

3468
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,639
here pretty soon

3469
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:44,639
i saw the conductor also come in to

3470
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:47,119
check on us so yeah one last question

3471
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:49,040
yeah the final question oh well i'm

3472
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,880
afraid it'll be a comment but great

3473
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:56,880
just um a small incentive also as a

3474
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,880
early stage researcher to publish in

3475
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,639
this potential journal

3476
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:02,960
um i expect the quality of the reviews

3477
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,880
will be possibly order of magnitudes

3478
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:06,800
higher and i say from personal

3479
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,400
experience that

3480
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,239
the reviews that i do for journals tend

3481
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:11,679
to be longer and more thought out

3482
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:13,119
because i don't have so many to do at

3483
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:14,400
the same time

3484
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:15,440
and so

3485
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,599
one of the things that's been mentioned

3486
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:21,440
is it's frustrating as a phd student to

3487
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:24,560
sort of be thrown into this

3488
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,560
i don't know the satan pit of reviewing

3489
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,560
and not knowing like whether your paper

3490
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,079
is good or not and some of you are

3491
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,159
thinking it is and isn't well

3492
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:33,599
i think you get far more considered

3493
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:34,800
reviews when you have a journal

3494
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,800
submission process and so

3495
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,400
i don't know i think

3496
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,000
i think this would benefit your

3497
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,199
researchers very much indeed

3498
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,599
all right thanks a lot let's continue

3499
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:47,679
the discussion over some uh some drinks

3500
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:49,840
with a concert

3501
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:52,159
i look forward to continue this thank

3502
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:52,960
you

3503
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,679
and everybody
