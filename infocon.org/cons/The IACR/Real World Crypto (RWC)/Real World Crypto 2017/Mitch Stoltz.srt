1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
hi good morning everybody I'm Mitch told

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,689
so I'm a lawyer at the Electronic

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,260
Frontier Foundation in San Francisco

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,420
where a donor supported nonprofit

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,639
changing gears<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit here because</font>

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,939
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking actually trying</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to teach you some lon its law that</font>

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,680
impacts probably a lot of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> work and</font>

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,670
the security encrypt of research and

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">practice in general and I'm tell you a</font>

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,470
little bit about what we EF efforts are

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,170
doing to try to remove this particular

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,269
threat to security research and security

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:46,800
work I am a lawyer I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lawyer</font>

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:48,300
unless you know differently and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,910
u.s. lawyer so this talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,440
a bit us<font color="#CCCCCC"> focused but this particular law</font>

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,209
that I'm talking about is called section

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,980
1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,440
Act has equivalent in most developed

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,898
countries except<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel interestingly so</font>

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,780
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folks from it from</font>

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,470
Israel here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk mode you do not have</font>

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,299
this particular threat when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're home</font>

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,220
but anyone with sort of significant

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,790
connections to the US needs to know

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,479
about this and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have this have an</font>

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,479
issue here

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm doing here so so so what is this the</font>

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,229
this law<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was passed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1998 and</font>

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the basic piece of it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

32
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,460
and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this adjunct of</font>

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,000
copyright law so we all of this what I'm

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,110
talking about it has a connection to

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,439
protection of creative work including

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,289
software it's not really specifically a

37
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">like-new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking law or computer</font>

38
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:51,130
intrusion law but it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">very specific type to crypto which which</font>

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,190
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you but the basis was in</font>

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,048
protecting creative work including

42
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,369
software about some movies music and

43
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:04,959
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creative work and this is the</font>

44
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:07,000
basic the heart of it here<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

45
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,310
shall circumvent a technological measure

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,590
that effectively controls access to a

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:15,549
copyrighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> work what does that man</font>

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,290
right there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of things here</font>

49
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,080
right so what's a copyrighted work again

50
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's any all that's generally any</font>

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,319
form of creative work including software

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,120
source code object code any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

53
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,328
and then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then what a circumvent</font>

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,880
technological measure means what the law

55
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,709
gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that definition there you</font>

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,459
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very specific all out to</font>

57
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:47,440
decrypting and encrypted work so if

58
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:49,510
there is software or a video audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> pros</font>

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,790
and any other sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creative work that</font>

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,709
with some sort of access control on it

61
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,350
and the bypassing that access control

62
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,090
involves decryption or also these

63
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">wishy-washy things avoid bite has</font>

64
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,569
removed the activate very kind of

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,280
loosely defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know you can</font>

66
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,138
face liability under this law and it can

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,180
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be civil or criminal there are</font>

68
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:11,980
pretty significant civil or criminal

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,709
penalties on this and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

70
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">used it's not just not just not just</font>

71
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:22,780
words again this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> originally written</font>

72
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,780
with 1998 technology in mind and the

73
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,980
specifically technology around

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,620
traditional creative work so this was

75
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,459
the canonical example at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time was</font>

76
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,310
the encryption on DVDs and various kinds

77
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,720
of digital auto

78
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,870
encryption none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are really</font>

79
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:45,370
relevant anymore but the law is written

80
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:47,630
really broadly and then and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

81
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,900
really kind of the most troubling part

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,120
it's not just a ban on bypassing

83
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,739
encryption or circumventing a technical

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,819
measure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the terms there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

85
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,680
this is sometimes you'll hear the who

86
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,720
the term drm digital rights management

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,140
digital restrictions management this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's another term for these sorts of</font>

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,899
controls often cryptographic not always

90
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,830
but the even<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse part really is this</font>

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,209
part here because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> bands</font>

92
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,860
manufacturing importing or again this

93
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,160
wishy washy word other provider

94
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,109
otherwise traffic in any technology

95
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,710
product service device component or part

96
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:27,950
thereof this has been used against

97
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:32,599
researchers against the the discussion

98
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,550
or delivery of information about one of

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,289
these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> about crypto systems that</font>

100
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,940
are used in this way that's really

101
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,440
troublesome because it affects really

102
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,330
kind of the very thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all doing</font>

103
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,630
here and the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot does</font>

104
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,729
that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you doin in your in your</font>

105
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:56,090
day-to-day and this is exactly what we

106
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:59,120
saw so this love it was written to add

107
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,280
an extra level safeguard to things like

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,520
DVDs and the emerging digital

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,638
entertainment media of the 1990s<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

110
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,419
very quickly and in 2000-2001 it's begun

111
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,820
to be used against<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and</font>

112
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,469
encryption research many of you have

113
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably heard of some of these so that</font>

114
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,320
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> research is just in two thousand</font>

believe it was two thousand a research

118

<font color="#CCCCCC">that scheme as with many forms of audio</font>

that at a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they got a</font>

give that talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but but but not</font>

in the forum they wanted it was delayed

129
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,580
they were censored in that sense there's

130

a they was they originally withdrawn

their paper from that conference the the

2600 magazine lawsuits again this is

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably familiar to some of you I know</font>

and the contender at the conclusion of

<font color="#CCCCCC">that law says they were banned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from ever</font>

publishing this algorithm or linking to

any website that published this

algorithm this is really gets at the

143

heart of a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a restriction on</font>

speech of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort that US law is really</font>

145
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,509
very allergic to a notion that this is

these if not in a criminal sense than

but but this is where it's at these and

196
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,399
least sort of a bright side is that the

law does pretend to express a concern

198
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,820
for encryption research and security

199
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,020
research more generally and if you just

200
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">read this part of it it looks pretty</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">good right it's not a violation for</font>

pretty good right but then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

206
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:39,270
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so so the factors to be</font>

209
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,020
this you know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you advancing the</font>

facilitating a violation of law well

213
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,610
first of all what if you're doing both

214
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,250
or what if someone else violates the law

215
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,410
based on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said or and then</font>

216
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,060
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this second one here are you</font>

217
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">engaging a legitimate course study or</font>

00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,370
looks at language like this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> visions</font>

224
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,589
world what what you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in here is</font>

225
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,319
a set of steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can follow that</font>

will protect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of steps that</font>

229
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,990
reasonably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be good going to be</font>

230
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:45,589
sued there's no there's no real sort of

231
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:47,180
safe harbor in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wishy-washy and</font>

232
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:49,550
that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means expensive</font>

233
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:56,269
litigation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means again a lot of</font>

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:59,329
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> for self-censorship there's a</font>

235
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:02,810
similar one by the way for for security

236
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,638
testing rather than encryption research

237
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,829
but it's got all it's got bit kind of

238
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,029
this this this same wish you wash it

239
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,560
will will balance all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these and</font>

240
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:13,040
remember this balancing is get gets done

241
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:17,709
by either a judge or a jury of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay</font>

242
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:23,000
people so right not not by experts

243
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:25,279
there's another way to in theory protect

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,269
against these sorts of legal threats and

245
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,550
that administrative process every three

246
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:34,449
years the US Copyright Office which is

247
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,310
part of the u.s. Library of Congress

248
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,579
holds a proceeding which is used to it

249
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,449
complex it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a year and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font>

250
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:47,000
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like a court case and</font>

251
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's quite expensive we put a lot of</font>

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,290
resources into this and we have you know

253
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,559
every three years for many years now

254
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,410
many other organizations do too but what

255
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,350
results from these is temporary

256
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,500
exemptions to the ban on circumventing

257
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,009
access controls in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most recent cycle</font>

258
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,079
this is what we got and really suffers

259
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,509
from the same problems as the permanent

260
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,709
one that I just showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what dessert</font>

261
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:18,470
is a permission from the US government

262
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:21,018
to circumvent solely for the purpose of

263
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,910
good faith security research only for

264
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,910
these three

265
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,780
categories of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

266
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,910
a government process here right yeah so

267
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,650
a device for machine primarily designed

268
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:36,010
for use by individual consumers

269
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,209
including voting machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay voting</font>

270
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,520
machines good i'm not sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

271
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,670
consumer devices but we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

272
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,949
by land vehicles and implantable medical

273
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,900
devices not actually intended for use by

274
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,460
patients so these are good things but

275
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're drawn or I'll drawn pretty</font>

276
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,280
narrowly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't cover a lot of</font>

277
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,990
really security critical applications of

278
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:02,470
encryption and then same kind of really

279
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:07,720
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of narrow and subjective and and</font>

280
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:12,280
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reassuring caveat on this</font>

281
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,340
thing it has to be done in a controlled

282
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,699
environment designed to avoid any harm

283
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,140
to individuals or the public no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really knows what that means you know it</font>

285
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,770
really would take a court of you know

286
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and probably a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

litigation even figure out what that

288
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">means so beforehand it's pretty hard to</font>

289
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,620
know whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whose work you</font>

actually came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the challenges to</font>

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,320
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty well established at this</font>

point<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmca 1201 also restrict restrict</font>

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,770

of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our plaintiffs are</font>

and sir convention is a necessary

494
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:07,490
predicate to speech so in the past

495
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:12,679
courts have said you can't in the rest

496
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:14,450
of the government can't indirectly limit

497
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,590
speech by

498
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:22,010
the availability of printers ink or by

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,139
to things or citizens access to

503
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,620
recording public meetings or law

504
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,840
enforcement so you can't if<font color="#CCCCCC"> where these</font>

505
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,580
things are necessary predicate to speech

506
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,300
the government can't restrict those

507
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,419
either and so where do the ability to

508
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:54,730
decrypt with the ability to talk about

509
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:57,830
decryptions is necessary predicate to

510
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,000
the research and and and and having

511
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,429
these sorts of discussions and doing

512
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in doing this work then then there</font>

513
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,660
were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a restriction on speech and</font>

514
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,030
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the really the core about</font>

515
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,480
the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a First Amendment argument</font>

516
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,120
in many cases if any law that restrict

517
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:19,700
speech has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> written as narrowly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

518
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:23,929
possible and again this one isn't and we

519
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,040
give examples but uh this restricts a

520
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,320
lot more speech than necessary

521
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,940
particularly because it's not tied to

522
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:37,189
illegal behavior 12 section 1201 cut of

523
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,020
makes illegal the activities that aren't

524
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,550
ins that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily lead to any</font>

525
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,770
other illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities so we're not</font>

526
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,159
promoting or encouraging copyright

529
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,480
whatever other sorts of legal violations

530
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:04,550
we can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that's we're not going</font>

531
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:07,580
there now that's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes a lot too</font>

532
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:12,560
broad and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally I mentioned about</font>

533
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:14,720
the speech licensing regime there we

534
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,070
what the way you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in comparison</font>

535
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,010
here is permits for demonstrations

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:27,500
permits for street marches

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:29,549
various sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Licensing these happen</font>

538
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,659
what the First Amendment says and what

00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courts are said about these things</font>

540
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that they have some shafts and it has</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to be based on very specific criteria so</font>

542
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,700
that government officials can't use them

543
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:47,730
arbitrarily or to make sort of arbitrary

544
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,429
distinctions this<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-year process is</font>

neither<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those research that someone</font>

wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now papers that people want</font>

547

this and that the criteria for actually

551
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,289
getting those<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit arbitrary right</font>

556
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,039
think we're just about out of time but

557

it but i'll be i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here and we are</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this where it needs to go</font>

hmm

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,040
okay good luck

567
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,299
maybe we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk rude yeah yeah</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyway I was wondering if you could</font>

have my doubts that such an argument

would ever hold up in court but I'm

wondering if there is any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

582
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:03,630
what about what they've said remember

583
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not technologists and what</font>

584
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've said is really even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

585
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,820
minimal of encryption is enough to

586
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,230
invoke the protections of this law what

587
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably is not enough is is you know a</font>

588
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,410
physical or digital label that says

589

please don't copy this or please don't

590
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:26,040
inspect this code that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough but</font>

591
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:30,210
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> rot13 is probably enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

592
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,740
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so I want to apologize to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone here at everyone else's does it</font>

594
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,290
because I'm partly responsible by my

contacts with AT&T<font color="#CCCCCC"> s lobbyists way back</font>

596
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:43,500
when for a crucial error in the DMCA it

597
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,080
talks about encryption research not

598
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,210
cryptographic research and encryption is

599
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,980
defined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scrambling or unscrambling</font>

600
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,750
because hash functions digital

601
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,520
signatures and all the others lonely

602
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,940
things we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with so I want to</font>

605
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:06,990
you can ask you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bath</font>
