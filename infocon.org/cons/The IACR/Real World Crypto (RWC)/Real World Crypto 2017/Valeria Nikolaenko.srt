58
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:15,579
the server requires the certificate

chain and servers exchange message<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

60
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,540
the client sends his portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key</font>

61
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,790
exchange and they finish the handshake

and at this point from to exchange

and onwards they will increase the rest

of the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the symmetric</font>

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,319
first part is where the server

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,269
authenticate itself to the client the

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">second part is where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client and the</font>

73
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,599
server agree on the team and the third

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">part is where the traffic is encrypted</font>

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,599
using symmetric encryption so we don't

76
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,609
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting the first part</font>

against one of attacks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

78
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:01,959
because suddenly in the future when

79
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,879
quantum computers are around they will

80
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to impersonate the server but</font>

81
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,620
this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not compromise the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simplicity</font>

82
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,019
of today's connections to protect the

83
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,640
last part the symmetric encryption we

84
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,950
just need to double the size of the key

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
so that's easy but the protocol we use

86
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,668
for key agreement cannot be broken by a

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,230
quantum computer meaning they're

88
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,569
efficient quantum algorithms that can

89
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,690
recover the symmetric shared key and

90
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:28,030
decrypt the rest of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here</font>

91
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,549
is an important point to understand if

92
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,500
someone record disconnections today and

93
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,090
get a quantum computer in the future

94
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,680
then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to go back and</font>

95
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,900
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the connections that we do</font>

109
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:11,440
suddenly there was a tremendous progress

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,720
over the last decade there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many ways</font>

111
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,358
to argue that you should indeed care and

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,310
let me show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a few of them so perhaps</font>

113
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,959
the most successful groups comes from

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,559
for a budget of about 1 billion dollars

119
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,150
the next fact is in 2014 from

120
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,520
revelations of Edward Snowden who

121
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned that NSA for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example is working</font>

the guinea quantum computer and a year

123
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,820
ago they put a notice on their websites

124
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,380
urging us to move towards quantum secure

125

cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> and encourage any research</font>

126
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,310
in this direction the visitors are

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,310
coming from NSA might be somewhat worse

128
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,260
them overall there is another grown

129
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,210
effort in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> investment in this</font>

130
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,849
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so probably we need to prepare</font>

141
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,960
this assumption is very easy to explain

142
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,940
essentially it states that it's hard to

the TV land based on this assumption

disassembled assumption this piece will

231
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,850

239
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,768
the agreement is very similar except

240
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,660
instead of raising three two powers to

241
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:20,079
be multiplying matrix a by other

242
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,410
matrices so the server will kick random

small matrices X and P and sent a times

244

<font color="#CCCCCC">l3 assumption guarantees that this</font>

246

independent of that the client on his

doing multiplication from different

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,920

take clients message x x on the right

255
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:58,060
and yet something that's close to white

256
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,640
and a dance tax because when you

260
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,320
approximate the agreement at this point

both parties can discuss this

274
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,969
in mind here is that the protocol has a

nonzero probability of failure when the

over again but when tuning the

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,100
you'll see later that the new hope is a

show reductions to the largest problems

445
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,740
so we can search the space of parameters

446
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,168
to find the best set that minimizes

467

the failure probability is less than

468
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,809
once in a billion so in practice the

470
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:25,080

great thanks Laura so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

645
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:36,450
questions actually i'll ask a question

646
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh who brought up this issue that since</font>

647
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,950
we're building security for 30 years

648
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,750
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we might 128-bit security might</font>

649
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,910
not be enough so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sense of</font>

650
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,390
like if you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to say you know</font>

651
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:52,559
160-bit security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Frodo even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

652
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:56,160
settings well so our security estimates

653
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,470
are very very conservative so it's

654
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,630
likely that same parameters will

655
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,960
withstand attacks in 50 years for today

656
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,640
but that's a valid point but also the

657
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,500
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how fast will be quite a</font>

658
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,590
visitor to be and that's kind of hard to

659
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,510
predict so but it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good question</font>

660
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,129
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit security</font>

661
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,309
but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's probably more than 120</font>

662
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:20,429
at this yes probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more yes I have</font>

663
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,500
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a related question so this</font>

664
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:25,020
presentation in particular but the whole

665
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,690
session on quantum cryptography seems to

666
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,220
have this assumption or be based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

667
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,580
notion that we should already be doing

668
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:37,290
something post quantum in the real world

669
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:39,510
so by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I'm kind of mean I should</font>

670
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:42,420
immediately today basically go starting

671
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,850
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know trying to create my new super</font>

672
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,580
secret system using the stuff that's in

673
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,870
openssl for example already and all the

674
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,990
other implementations that are open

675
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,489
source and yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing that you know</font>

676
00:26:51,990 --> 00:27:00,120
you mentioned the mass<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the paper</font>

677
00:26:53,490 --> 00:27:01,920
that shook your faith in ring lwe what

678
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,139
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we recommend here I mean you know</font>

679
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,050
should I actually just increase my key

680
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,550
sizes for doing RSA and assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

681
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,879
won't build a big enough quantum

682
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,620
computer in the near future as an

683
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,360
immediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world thing or is it</font>

684
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic that I should start</font>

685
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,100
going doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something here with these</font>

686
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:25,379
new protocols just your opinion I know

687
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,429
my team us take down a<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat down shaking</font>

688
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,420
his head in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wings</font>

689
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,190
well my opinion is that you should

690
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,920
definitely start thinking about it at

691
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,110
least maybe not immediately use it by

692
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,740
start research in this direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

693
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,810
then we'll see what the progress is

694
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,400
concurrent<font color="#E5E5E5"> progressing based from</font>

695
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,429
physicist who are building a new

696
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,690
computer so and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

697
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:53,540
think about after that I mean the missus

698
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,490
process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just starting but I would say</font>

699
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,879
the advices do nothing just wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

700
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:02,930
NIST process to end and then do whatever

701
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,850
whatever is agreed upon what plan plan

702
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,530
to do nothing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

703
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,510
and wait for the niche process to run

704
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,160
its course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell my</font>

705
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,290
manager that yeah that's that work

706
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,000
people love this advice do nothing

707
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:19,250
people love this great any other any

708
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,850
other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks Larry</font>

709
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,850
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>
