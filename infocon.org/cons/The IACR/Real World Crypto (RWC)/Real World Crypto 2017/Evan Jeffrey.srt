00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
hi yes I'm Evan Jeffrey and I work at

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,219
Google the reason you see a UCSD logo

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,320
here is because I used to work at a lab

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,150
at UC Santa Barbara before Google

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,480
started this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they hired</font>

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:19,320
several of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the lab to build the</font>

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,199
Google scalable quantum hardware team so

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,340
in particular some of these this device

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,930
here I don't know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it</font>

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually says UCSB because it was</font>

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,300
fabricated while we're at UCSB so they

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,340
get some credit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as well and</font>

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,500
here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures of</font>

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,780
chips that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in our lab for</font>

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:43,290
various purposes so the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this or</font>

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,940
perhaps slightly ambitious I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,700
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is quantum computing</font>

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,209
what is google trying to do to build a

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,219
quantum computer for you guys when

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,670
should you<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried about quantum</font>

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,660
computing putting the current RSA and

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,930
just and elliptic curve cryptography at

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,369
risk and what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google hope to do</font>

24
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,229
with the quantum computer because I want

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make absolutely clear we are not</font>

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,600
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> crack your toes the lawyers</font>

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,580
definitely don't want me to give the

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,770
wrong impression there so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you the maybe the shortest</font>

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,570
introduction to quantum computing ever

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,798
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference between quantum and</font>

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,619
classical computing is kind of

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,509
illustrated here we have classical

34
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,549
computing we have bit you can have

35
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,470
multiple bits you have exponentially

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,450
many combinations as you increase the

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,220
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits and you have you know the</font>

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,070
standard gates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you learned about in</font>

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,619
you know undergraduate classes and at

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:52,008
least for logic rather than long-term

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:55,408
storage data is universally stored in

42
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:58,290
the voltage or charge on a transistor

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,170
circuit this shows a dram cell but

44
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,790
there's SRAM and logic gates as well

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,719
quantum computing well we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,610
funny brackets on the 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 1 and then</font>

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,019
we show we can also for a single qubit

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,740
we have these other states that look

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,140
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

50
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,490
10 minus 10 plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minus i1 and then</font>

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,190
you can also have just like the

52
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,860
classical computing multi qubit state

53
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,690
and there's exponentially many<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis</font>

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">States here as you increase the number</font>

55
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits and one big difference is no</font>

56
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,760
one's built one of these yet so nobody

57
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,510
who's decided whether they should use

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,870
vacuum tubes or transistors or relays so

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,670
here's like four different

60
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,440
implementations that someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

61
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,410
thinks each of these is the best way to

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,090
build a quantum computer and then we're

63
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:53,040
building this superconducting one right

64
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,540
here so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the best then</font>

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,040
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do what do you do with a</font>

66
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,220
quantum computer why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it different so</font>

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,920
a given state can be is represented by a

68
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,250
vector like there you can kind of think

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these amplitudes here as</font>

70
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,740
probabilities but they're not and I'll

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,739
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> why but these two parameters</font>

72
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,840
theta<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 it's a unit vector complex</font>

73
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,700
unit vector and you can map it to a

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,470
point on a sphere this is a nice

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,429
visualization for a single qubit in our

76
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,050
gates up for the single qubit are now

77
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,740
linear operators from the group at you

78
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">two and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two cubic gates now we</font>

79
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,740
have these four<font color="#CCCCCC"> basis States here and we</font>

80
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,310
can have any linear combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

81
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,530
and there's many possible to cubic dates

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only ones that people are</font>

83
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in for the most part are the</font>

84
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">c naught and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thus easy and again it's</font>

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:58,589
just a matrix multiplication to apply a

86
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,240
2 cubic gate and the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,500
those amplitudes different from

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,320
probabilities different from a

89
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,390
stochastic computer is that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

90
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">negative which means when you add them</font>

91
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,850
together in a matrix multiplication is

92
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiplied in some elements of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

93
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,750
can have different sign and they can

94
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,548
cancel and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get knows and this is</font>

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,350
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures from all of</font>

diffraction pattern done with electrons

98
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,000
rather than photons which is you know

99
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,920
what you normally see and it's

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,750
indistinguishable you wouldn't know that

101
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,230
that was electrons rather than photons

102
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:38,450
unless I told you because they operate

103
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:40,700
the same way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want a longer</font>

104
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,820
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend this</font>

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,140

misconceptions about quantum computing

slightly more thorough introduction than

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:19,760
I just gave so that's all I'm going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">quantum computing they'll get a little</font>

118
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,180
more into what's actually required to

119
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,000
make it in a bit but this is the system

120
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,510
we're using their superconducting

131
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,020
at the bottom there's a device called a

132
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,900
squid a superconducting quantum

133
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,630
interference device it's made of a

134
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,349
tunnel junction or two tunnel junctions

135
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,570
actually which makes this a nonlinear

136
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,750
circuit so each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices is</font>

137
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:22,130
essentially a non linear harmonic

138
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:27,289
oscillator and that is enough to allow

139

us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do qubit operations the resonant</font>

between five and six gigahertz

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,220
each one has to control lines one of

00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:04,780
phase and frequency the second line we

150
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,730
apply a<font color="#E5E5E5"> current to which changes the</font>

151
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,880
frequency of the qubit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said there</font>

152
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,460
between five<font color="#E5E5E5"> and six gigahertz we can</font>

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">wecan frequency tune them that's part of</font>

154
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,289
our personal approach not all qubits are

155
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,840
tunable and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that is</font>

156
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,210
that's the way we do two cubed gates if

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,940
we bring two adjacent qubits to the same

158
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,469
frequency there's an interaction between

159
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,990
them and it turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes a</font>

160
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,210
control V gate which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those 22</font>

161
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,730
cubic gates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about the</font>

162
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:42,549
floor so just like a NAND gate is

163
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,540
universal for classical computing single

164
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,790
qubit arbitrary rotations + ctrl<font color="#CCCCCC"> v gate</font>

165
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,710
is universal for quantum computing so

166
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a quantum algorithm it</font>

167
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,820
can be decomposed down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

168
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:59,320
elements so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of those</font>

169
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:01,330
elements in this device one of the nice

170
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,080
things about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's a single layer</font>

171
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:08,020
fab there's will say almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> single layer</font>

172
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> junctions have a slight overlap but</font>

173
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,440
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> aluminum on a insulating</font>

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,120
substrate the reason that's important

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,250
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quantum systems they're made</font>

176
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,010
of single photons or single<font color="#E5E5E5"> excitation</font>

177
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of some sort and they're very prone to</font>

178
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,870
noisy coherence from the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

179
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,480
extra materials any extra layers you put

180
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:37,270
on your chip make your decoherence worse

181
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:41,180
so we our goal is stick with this the

182
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,300
simplest possible fab a grad student

183
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,899
a new employee can learn to do this and

184
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:51,529
get functional devices in you know a

185
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,320
week or two in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean room getting</font>

186
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the design takes more effort but it's</font>

187
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,930
not like you know an Intel CMOS process

188
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:07,310
with God knows how many metal layers and

189
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:10,250
15 nanometer technology so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

190
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,170
simple the problem is right now our

191
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,690
signals can't cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> over each other so</font>

192
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,729
we're the devices we make right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

193
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,910
limited to this single line which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as</font>

194
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:25,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can imagine not a terribly scalable</font>

195
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:26,420
architecture and i'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> more at the</font>

196
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:32,240
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I of time about what we're doing</font>

197
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get past that so the process of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

198
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,820
thing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said these are super</font>

199
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,490
conducting they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

200
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,480
cooled down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten millikelvin to</font>

201
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,390
operate with lowest noise so the going

202
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,050
from a device here to something we can

203
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,970
measure this chip is mounted into a

204
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,719
sample holder here which is attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

205
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">this copper place we put this copper can</font>

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">around it and the entire thing goes in a</font>

207
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,540
dilution refrigerator which is a

208
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,330
multi-stage cryogenic system that cools

209
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,099
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hopefully below 20 millikelvin</font>

210
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,680
with nothing in it it gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 once we</font>

211
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,100
put all of our experiments<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it's not</font>

212
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,729
quite that cold and we have you know

213
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,160
there was two control lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> for qubit</font>

214
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:25,130
plus a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of extra for readout so we</font>

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:27,740
have for this chip there are 20 coaxial

216
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,350
lines going up and down from room

217
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,930
temperature to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 millikelvin and then</font>

218
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,430
they get this whole system gets closed

219
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,010
up it's right here and then there's like

220
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">racks of conventional electronics that</font>

221
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,050
apply these microwave pulses and these

222
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,770
frequency tuning pulses to the qubits

223
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,719
through the coax to allow us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do all</font>

224
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:53,019
of our gate operations on the qubits

225
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,329
so that's and then you know over here we

226
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:58,209
have classical computers that we can sit

227
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:01,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">down at we can say okay do me do a</font>

228
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:03,670
sequence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you know a rotation on</font>

229
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:09,430
qubit three<font color="#E5E5E5"> control Z between qubits</font>

230
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:15,550
three and four so on and so forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

231
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:17,279
does that pretty nice yeah so we're

232
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,719
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a brute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force approach</font>

233
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,220
other people in the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing</font>

234
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,139
different approaches they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,079
build there's topological quantum

236
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:29,529
computing which uses superconducting

237
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,569
circuits but sort of attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a</font>

238
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,230
error robust system directly in the

239
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:37,509
cubed there's people using all kinds of

240
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things people trying to make cold</font>

241
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,680
logic so all of that room temperature

242
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,199
electronics they try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put inside</font>

243
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">their dilution refrigerator</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i keeps the</font>

244
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:52,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">cables shorter reduces it improves a lot</font>

245
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,389
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can't go by you know</font>

246
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:57,250
arbitrary waveform generator is off the

247
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:59,379
shelf that work at in a dilution

248
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,829
refrigerator so we are sticking with

249
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:05,139
this brute force approach no classical

250
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:10,449
logic in the fridge lots and lots of

251
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:12,819
coaxial cables which is generally rule

252
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,469
if you've ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a physics lab the</font>

253
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll notice is that they</font>

254
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,629
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> love coaxial cables we like that</font>

255
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:24,759
too and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have built a</font>

256
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:27,399
sophisticated software stack that allows

257
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to take you know a gate sequence that</font>

258
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,639
a theorist will come to us and say can

259
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this gate sequence and and just</font>

260
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,139
automatically turns that into the

261
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:41,350
correct waveforms also does all the

262
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:46,689
calibration the conventional approach

263
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,430
here is you take a a grad student sits

264
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,959
down in front of the computer and says

265
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay measure the frequency of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two-bit</font>

266
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they write that down</font>

267
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,079
measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frequency of Cuba to and</font>

268
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:00,250
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that down that works for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three or</font>

269
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,780
five maybe ten cubits what

270
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,610
problem is these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> drift faster</font>

271
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:07,420
than grad students can calibrate them so

272
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,160
we need automated calibration there's

273
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,410
more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more and more parameters</font>

274
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,870
to do more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more accurate control so</font>

275
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:19,740
grad students are not scalable that's

276
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:23,410
the first thing we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve so</font>

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's our physical approach why</font>

278
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,770
is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hard classical computing has a</font>

279
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,810
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going for it there's many</font>

280
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,990
levels of robustness built into a

281
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,060
classical computer you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vram</font>

282
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,940
cell i showed before has tended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

283
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:48,760
electrons per bit we work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a single</font>

284
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:52,090
excitation energies much smaller than

285
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:57,130
that of a small fraction of an electron

286
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:59,530
volt classical logic can use feedback so

287
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,660
an SRAM cell has two transistors one is

288
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,240
on and one is off and you're constantly

289
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,000
measuring and amplifying each of those

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,830
two cells and feeding back so if it

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,839

292
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,790
immediately correct and then you can

293
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:17,500
build forward error correction on top of

294
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:20,709
that we don't have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in error</font>

295
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,690
correction ability in our quantum

296
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,190
systems there's a little bit of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

297
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,000
i mentioned in like topological quantum

298
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:33,970
computing but that is i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say still</font>

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:39,790
in its infancy at best we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

300
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:41,320
duplicate our quantum states there's a

301
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,630
there's a theorem that says you can't do

302
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,339
that and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse there's</font>

303
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,130
two types of errors I said you have this

304
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:51,460
sphere so there's two axes on which your

305
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,960
your cubic can screw up for H cubed that

306
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,500
means your error correction code has to

307
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:02,320
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of those so this sounds</font>

308
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty bad but oh and just I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

309
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,940
to go through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no cloning theorem but</font>

310
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,939
this is really a key problem or key

311
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,860
issue is that you can't clone an unknown

312
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:17,670
state because with linear operation

313
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,160
so we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't say initialize</font>

314
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,699
five copies of our quantum computer run

315
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,319
it for you know some period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

316
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,510
measure those five copies take a

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,550
majority vote and then reinitialize

318
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:33,630
everything start over we need to do all

319
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our redundancy has to be initialized</font>

320
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,890
at the beginning and then preserved by

321
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,970
mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't directly measure</font>

322
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,010
the state and in fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be able</font>

323
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to perform gate operations directly on</font>

324
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,870
our encoded<font color="#CCCCCC"> state it's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

325
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,560
homomorphic error correction code if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

326
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,840
want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,670
a solution there's actually several

328
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,310
solutions to quantum error correcting

329
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,380
codes that meet these requirements the

330
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,469
one that we approach we are using is

331
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,390
called the surface code so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses a</font>

332
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,580
patch geometry like this a

333
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,430
two-dimensional array<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nearest</font>

334
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,700
neighbor couplings so that's not what we

335
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,810
have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not so far off</font>

336
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,560
comparing if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed arbitrary</font>

337
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:22,040
long-range coupling between the qubits

338
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,550
so this patch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of twenty five cubits</font>

339
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,620
would make a single logical qubit and

340
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,180
you can in fact make the patch bigger to

341
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,220
get better error suppression and so

342
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,500
forth and so the the white circles here

343
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,170
are the data qubits those are together

344
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,540
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to store a single quantum bit</font>

345
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,160
and then these<font color="#E5E5E5"> n symbols are</font>

346
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,410
measurements to this so what each one

347
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,170
does in every cycle of our computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

348
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,689
it measures the parity of all of the

349
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,180
data qubits adjacent to it and because

350
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,680
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a parity operation it doesn't</font>

351
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,770
reveal the the the actual state of the

352
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,810
encoded logical qubit it only reveals

353
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,609
errors because an error will change the

354
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:12,079
parody on at least two locations so this

355
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:14,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the surface code and some of these</font>

356
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,849
yet the light measure qubits are

357
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,650
measuring the bits lip for bit flip

358
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,270
errors and the dark ones are measuring

359
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,560
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> face flip errors and that's</font>

360
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,650
fundamentally why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

361
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-dimensional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> array is so we can</font>

362
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:32,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">rekha both of those at the same time so</font>

363
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,270
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said this will map to a hardware</font>

364
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,450
implementation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

365
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,270
unforgiving this is as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I know</font>

366
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,060
that that's algorithm known in terms of

367
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,700
tolerance to errors so what this plot

368
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,800
shows here for different<font color="#E5E5E5"> sized patches</font>

369
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:54,500
to make a single qubit the bottom is the

370
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,200
physical error rate and the left axis is

371
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logical error rate so this point</font>

372
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is a threshold it's between one and</font>

373
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,860
two percent depending on how you count

374
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:09,770
errors and if your error rate is above

375
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,840
one percent then adding making a bigger

376
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,610
patch makes your hair is worse and if

377
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,320
it's below that adding a bigger patch

378
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,659
makes your errors better so obviously we

379
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,030
want to be below that but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

380
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,700
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about making a you know</font>

381
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:27,440
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can compute a factor at</font>

382
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,570
2048 that number you need logical error

383
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,520
rates<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to the minus 14 the same things</font>

384
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know people routinely get with</font>

385
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,530
classical computers and that our best

386
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,320
devices have just under<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 percent error</font>

387
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,230
we really hope and think we need to get

388
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to about a tenth of a percent</font>

389
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,160
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even at its sense of a percent we're</font>

390
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about patches with hundreds of</font>

391
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,850
physical qubits for logical qubit so

392
00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:01,399
that's one factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overhead is is</font>

393
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:03,530
that then the other problem I said we

394
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,670
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the error-correcting codes to</font>

395
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,590
do we could do logical gates directly on

396
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,620
the error-correcting codes it turns out

397
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,240
there's somewhat obviously a discrete

398
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,250
set of gates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do that way not</font>

399
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,440
a continuous set and they're called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

400
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Clifford gates and for a single qubit</font>

401
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,980
they mean rotating<font color="#E5E5E5"> this octahedron onto</font>

402
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,870
itself and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two qubit they include</font>

403
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,690
the control phase and the controller

404
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">control Z and control not gate so it's</font>

405
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,980
almost everything we need but<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

406
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,520
Clifford gates is actually group and

407
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,130
that means

408
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,780
it's pretty limited because any series

409
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,290
of Clifford gates is another Clifford

410
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,510
gate so it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out it's not Universal</font>

411
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,930
by itself we need one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more game and</font>

412
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,030
conventionally if this pi over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 date</font>

413
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,850
it's a rotation that's not in this

414
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,310
Clifford set and you can't perform that

415
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,370
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface code but there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

416
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this which is if you imagine if</font>

417
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,540
you had a classical computer that could

418
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,880
perform a not gate but you could do an

419
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,100
exclusive or if you initialize and

420
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,290
silica fit to a one-state and do an

421
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:14,310
exclusive or that's a not gate we can do

422
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,260
the same thing we can initialize a we

423
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,169
can initialize anything we want in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

424
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">surface code and then we can do a two</font>

425
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,380
cubic date that sort of imprints that

426
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,300
rotation on to our target logical qubit

427
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,850
so the one in two cubic Clifford gates

428
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:34,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can perform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this T gate is</font>

429

a universal set of gates and we there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

430
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,810
a way to implement it unfortunately that

<font color="#CCCCCC">is where all of the overhead in a</font>

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,169
be activated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do different sorts of</font>

438

you don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these symbols mean</font>

440
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,060
they're small this is a TA and the

441
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,490
reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole process of</font>

442
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,159
initializing these ancilla and applying

443
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,710
them is probabilistic so you have to

444
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,450
iterate many times in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to do it</font>

445
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:20,340
with a 10 to the minus 14 error rate so

446
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">99% of a surface code quantum computer</font>

447

<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to do how hard a say a</font>

need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how many key gates</font>

455
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,389
are involved because everything else is

456
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,839
basically free

457
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:53,869
and this is a pretty daunting set of

458
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,149
numbers at least for me when we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9</font>

459
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,339
cubed ships in the lab you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:03,918
several thousand logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> cubits that's</font>

462
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:06,139
pretty obvious you know you might need

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,989
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add or multiply two of them so you</font>

464
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:13,129

466
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:18,259
code overhead we now need 10 million

467
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:21,708
physical qubits in order to encode those

468
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:23,749
state registers but we need 250 million

469
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:28,759
physical qubits to implement these these

470
00:22:23,749 --> 00:22:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">t gates and with a hypothetical computer</font>

471
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:35,029
with these 250 million physical qubits

472
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:37,190
we estimate at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 nanosecond cycle</font>

473
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:38,690
time that we currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate at we</font>

474
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,849
would take you about 10 hours to do this

475
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,709
so this is if you wanted to build a

476
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:46,849
computer for factoring which again we

477

479
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:54,619
big device compared to what we have but

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,458
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of these sort of fundamental</font>

484
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:08,959

00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:32,329
where you guys would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be worried</font>

492
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:35,659
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah so pretty much every part</font>

of the stack from the from the classical

way down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the interconnect on the chip</font>

496
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:44,269
there's tons of engineering work that's

497
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,908
going to be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be required</font>

503
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,950
all have slightly different approaches

505
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:13,810
this for various reasons so you know I

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I'm now confident that this</font>

507
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,770
can work if someone wants to build a

508
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,840
quantum computer bad enough they will

509
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:24,600
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people want to build</font>

510
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:27,669
it but I'll give some rules of thumb in

511
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,469
engineering research people have been

512
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying quantum computers will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here in</font>

513
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:37,300
10 to 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years for at least 10 to 15</font>

514
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:41,199
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and you know a few other</font>

515
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:44,260
examples of technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't seem</font>

516
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,220
to get closer as fast as it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

517
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,930
I'm pretty confident even just based on

518
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:55,540
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this work we've seen in the last</font>

519
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:58,090
year or two okay so why does google want

520
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,280
to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shor's algorithm does not</font>

521
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,409
have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of commercial applications at</font>

522
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">least not legitimate ones we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

523
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,880
interested in quantum simulation quantum

524
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:13,120
chemistry and classical optimization

525
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,200
these are all big industries that we

526
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,739
think there's a lot of room<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

527
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,220
improvement so quantum simulation is

528
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,480
kind of natural it's very expensive

529
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,040
people have told me that thirty percent

530
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,590
of the non-classified do a

531
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">supercomputing time is spent doing some</font>

532
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:32,020
form of quantum simulation because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

533
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,460
this exponentially large<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hilbert space</font>

534
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,750
that you have to keep track of the

535
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,220
memory requirements are very intense

536
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:44,320
that is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not hard for a</font>

537
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:47,350
quantum computer to do so one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

538
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">colleagues does is interested in quantum</font>

539
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,330
chemistry so this haber-bosch process is

540
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,610
consumes one to two percent of global

541
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,770
energy use and it's used to generate

542
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:00,429
nitrogen compounds for fertilizer and

543
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,200
plants do it in dirt whereas we have to

544
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:05,650
heat things up to 500 degrees c and

545
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,390
pressurize them even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small improvement</font>

546
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,020
in efficiency there which is catalyst

547
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,780
research

548
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:15,550
has potentially huge benefits but we

549
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,550
can't simulate even<font color="#E5E5E5"> this chemical</font>

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,629

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,450

567

578
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,750
is there are special purpose algorithms

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,850
for many many problems simulated

581
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,010
annealing is the best known<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

582
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,199
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> general purpose optimization</font>

583
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,180
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on your problem at</font>

584
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,460
all so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anything about</font>

585
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,590
it you simulated annealing if you know

586
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,880
something you use a more specialized

587
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:09,730
tool we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do better than simulated</font>

588
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,990
annealing for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is a</font>

589
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,990
potential application

590
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,539
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to my conclusions so</font>

591
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,870
fault-tolerant quantum computing is a

592
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:25,658
ways off we hope that these other

593
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,789
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> I forgot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

594
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:30,309
but the nice thing about autumn

595
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,620
chemistry and optimization is unlike

596
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,960
factoring you don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

597
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,998
exact solutions their systems where if

598
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,129
there's noise in the simulation you can

599
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:41,710
potentially get useful results out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

600
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:43,539
and there's a good chance you'll even

601
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,299
know that your results are useful just

602
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:49,600
by looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh so we hope that we</font>

603
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:51,940
can do some applications in these fields

604
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,178
before reaching the fault tolerant

605
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,779
threshold and without making 250 million

606
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:00,730
physical qubits and these applications

607
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:04,149
are much more interesting to us than

608
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,129
factoring anyway the thing we're working

609
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:09,129
on sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next year is called</font>

610
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:11,678
quantum supremacy which is getting a

611
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,840
quantum computer to do something sort of

612
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,389
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> no matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how contrived</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

proof of principle and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we're</font>

615
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:22,418
sort of focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that is because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

616

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same things no matter</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of quantum computer you're</font>

618
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:28,840
building in terms of the engineering

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,610
work to scale it up it kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doesn't</font>

620
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,789
matter what your application is but this

621
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:38,498
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty cubits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:41,259
do a tie problem faster than a classical

achieve achieve quantum supremacy please

642
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,419
can you talk very very carefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

643
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,189
press about what you've actually

644
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,809
achieved yeah because because they will

645
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,120
they will have a field day with that and

646
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,180
tell us that the sky is<font color="#CCCCCC"> falling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,830
talked about the basic science being in

00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,450
pretty good shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand the</font>

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,300
it do you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google was investing</font>

657
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,530
heavily in the engineering required to

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,820
make that skilling happens it's not

659
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:15,410
something you said explicitly in your

660
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,270
talk I yes so I mean I am a physicist by

661
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,059
training but i am now essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,470
more scalable than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university clean</font>

668
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,140
the parts of our system that require it

669
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,120
we're bringing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bum bonding process</font>

670
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,340
so that we can wait for bond two wafers

assistance from software engineers at

675
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,870
Google and we have our own software

676
00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:00,970
engineers on developing the classical

677
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,409
control software so Google is definitely

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,260
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineering side and</font>

679
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:09,920
and allowing and encouraging us to work

680
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:12,140
on that thank you very much could you

681
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,700
give an estimate like one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

682
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,679
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure of how many billions of</font>

would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a quantum computer if</font>

685
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:26,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted it I'm not sure</font>

686
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,760
because

687
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:34,460
say it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot on going to give</font>

688
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:36,260
the money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfer for reference the</font>

689
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,110
European Union has just started a

690
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:42,410
quantum computing project that is 1

691
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,270
billion dollars I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

692
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,700
going to yield a quantum computer simply

693
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,559
because it's divided among five

694
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,480
different projects at ten different

695
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,879
universities so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

696
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,590
generate a lot of useful research in

697
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,420
terms of new ideas new measurements but

698
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:03,320
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's focused enough to</font>

699
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:05,840
build a quantum computer I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

700
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">not allowed to to speculate about our</font>

701
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:15,439
budget with you guys but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell</font>

702
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,530
you that the current investment in the

703
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:24,160
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> field is a few billion dollars</font>

704
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:27,200
over the next five to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years and I</font>

705
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's the scalable part is further</font>

706
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,480
off than that but not by a factor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

707
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:41,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let's thank Evan again</font>
