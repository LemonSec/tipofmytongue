1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
maybe we can have reserved afterwards to

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,370
see if it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse than you</font>

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,340
think and for this audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,059
included<font color="#E5E5E5"> a footnote that may be</font>

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,639
particularly applicable so what have we

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:21,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing at Indiana University we</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,020
since 2014 that have looked at the

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,220
comprehensive we're trying to build a

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,429
comprehensive data set we looked at

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">akamai's top million websites and we</font>

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,610
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> planetlab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hid them every day</font>

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,600
and then we hit fish tank<font color="#E5E5E5"> every hour and</font>

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:45,450
for each fishing site we tried to

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,600
connect with HTTPS and then we look at

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:53,070
all the banks is defined by the FDIC we

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,739
did that twice the FDIC I we worked with

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,940
Richard Sullivan who is a wonderful

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,530
wonderful colleague and we instill want

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,459
to report to you some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen and I have got to say this is</font>

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the cheeriest presentation you'll</font>

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:19,919
see today so oh this is terrible to look

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:23,119
at well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little blue one</font>

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,759
that's sha-1 that's the good news the

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,210
disappearing at grayish one is in be

26
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,860
fine so that's disappearing yay and but

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,500
the other thing that you can't see

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,900
because the resolution is pretty bad the

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,759
slides will be available I'll just put

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,909
them up also for download is that 256

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,579
goes up and then decreases so there's

32
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,729
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful orange peak that gives us</font>

33
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,130
all reason for optimism and then it just

34
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes away and I'm not sure about what's</font>

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,079
happening there so last seen in 2013 is

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,960
I've seen 2013 put out in numerous

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,079
places so we're looking at the top

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,640
million websites and phishing sites we

39
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,769
are not doing a all ipv4 or not you know

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,609
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

41
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations have this</font>

42
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,520

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,530
closet but our left observation was in

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,320
2015 and because you can't see that in

45
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,690
the previous graph I've done various

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:36,980
levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus here so that's what a</font>

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:39,140
data point of one looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like here 2015</font>

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,070
which really surprised me when that

49
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,279
popped up now what about version version

50
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,920
3 is so nice it allows you know key

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,910
usage constraints as a standard it has

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,450
some wonderful extensions and it does

53
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,549
seem to be mostly adopted but not until

54
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:04,130
15 we saw a significant number of

55
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:07,960
version 1 certificates until well into

56
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:11,210
15 so that surprised me quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit and</font>

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,520
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fishing with TLS we've seen</font>

58
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:19,280
increased TLS fishing but it's still

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,940
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small and TLS abuse dominates TLS</font>

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,700
issuance that is to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I the big</font>

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:30,500
as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I can tell the big competition</font>

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:33,380
for botnet is cloud providers in terms

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,450
of fishing hosting the differences are

64
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">there different CAS represented</font>

65
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,369
different certificate authorities

66
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,370
dominate fishing as opposed to you know

67
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,920
it's not the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> swede the differences</font>

68
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,240
date of issuance and date<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen so for</font>

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">example you would we would not expect to</font>

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:59,870
see a small city provider of bus tickets

71
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:05,120
in the top million<font color="#E5E5E5"> website it would show</font>

72
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:07,250
up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> fish tank so there was a big lag</font>

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,830
between when it was issued lack of

74
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,100
extinct extensions and there were about

75
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,590
20 other features but with that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

76
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,810
distinguish them fairly well even with

77
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,269
very simple approaches like random

78
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">forest which is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of trees</font>

79
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:27,750
and average probability

80
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,609
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you fishing trends</font>

81
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,180
from two or three different points of

82
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,790
view so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hid in fish tank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every hour</font>

83
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:39,360
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12th you know this goes through</font>

84
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:42,510
September and these are pretty small

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,730
numbers so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and bad so the</font>

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,430
the good part about it is it means that

87
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,889
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have TLS you're probably not a</font>

88
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,280
fishing site the bad part of it is

89
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,680
social engineers aren't bothering right

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,059
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to look at this</font>

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular number and if you want to</font>

92
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at fishing trends as a percentage</font>

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,909
so this is the percentage of websites

94
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:14,220
that were validated as fishing on fish

95
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:16,710
tank<font color="#E5E5E5"> that responded to a request for a</font>

96
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,490
certificate either through hitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,799
port or a you know just a normal web

98
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,800
request so we were pretty fast and we

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,720
could we I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is good or</font>

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,370
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice thought I was a little happy</font>

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,610
about this we never had a problem that

102
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,270
they were taken down before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get</font>

103
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,630
to them so fishing trends remain a tiny

104
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,030
tiny percentage overall they're

105
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,450
increasing this does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not include cloud</font>

106
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,760
providers by the way so I pull clown

107
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,650
providing fishing out TLS fishing out

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,960
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a different kind</font>

109
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,179
of challenge and here it is as a

110
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,690
percentage but you can see that that big

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,810
drop-off in<font color="#E5E5E5"> July is a result of a</font>

112
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:04,229
massive increase and validated phishing

113
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,700
sites reported so and then we looked at

114
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:13,400
banks what's a bank we looked at the

115
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:17,039
FDIC list of federal depository of

116
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,870
insured institutions they're still our

117
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,000
mutual savings and loans there are

118
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">different kinds of institutions every</font>

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">year they have to fill out a form and</font>

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,060
that form includes their domain name now

121
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,390
often the people who fill out that form

122
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,860
put in their email address or they put

123
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,030
in the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

124

125
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:51,780
like health @ gmail.com or something so

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of the data is it may be the</font>

127
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:59,099
definitive list but it's not the

128
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:03,210
definitive list so we looked at on TLS

129
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:06,780
fishing fishing itself is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

130
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:12,120
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overall payment fraud so</font>

131
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:15,508
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this joke that oh now again how</font>

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,580
very intelligent robber that says well

133
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,069
why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> rob banks that's where the</font>

134
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,520
money is but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually where</font>

135
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,199
the money is you get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money if you</font>

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,508
hijack the correct tractor-trailer than

137
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,900
you do if you rob<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bank and so</font>

138
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:34,620
similarly there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are many victims many</font>

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,529
vulnerable victims I particularly older

142
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,389
it's an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue but if you're</font>

are three examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> 51 different banks it</font>

148
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:08,430
is bad but it's better than average<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

149
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:10,438
it's bad but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not terrible and what</font>

150
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,509
happens when there is an emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

151
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:19,650
you this is a cool icon so these are

152
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,020
people who went and they saw that

153
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,089
heartbleed was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they got that</font>

154
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,159
passwords were important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they</font>

155
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,900
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate so</font>

156
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:33,539
they took their certificate and they got

157
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:40,458
their CA to sign it again they kept the

158
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:43,970
same keys so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they meant so well</font>

159
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:46,319
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try so you can see there's a</font>

160
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:50,640
significant percentage of these people

161
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:51,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply like at ten percent right</font>

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,920
after heartbleed the

163
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,810
just didn't change their teeth so I you

164
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,370
can see people patched and they

165
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,439
understand patching they're like all

166
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,800
right we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a patch we've</font>

167
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,750
got that done but if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,760
early replacement of non expired

169
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,870
certificates only this summer did we see

170
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,029
more than ninety percent of the

171
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,920
certificates that have been acted that

172
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,010
we're active during heartbleed replaced

173
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,339
and that is predominantly because their

174
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,370
lifetimes expired people did not replace

175
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,370
certificates at anything at the level

176
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,890
you would expect for those changed in

177
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,380
response to heartbleed i'm going to give

178
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,319
more details on this most of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

179
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,740
upgrades meaning they increased key

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:44,150
links or they used<font color="#CCCCCC"> an improved hash</font>

181
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,400
algorithm some of them were down<font color="#E5E5E5"> grains</font>

182
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,709
so these are lifetime decreased and

183
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,110
lifetime increase so the big thing we

184
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,960
saw when people replaced certificates

185
00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:00,000
for heartbleed was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am NOT going</font>

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this again for a while so they</font>

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,870
changes in certificate algorithm what we

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,550
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly looked at key size</font>

189
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,440
change there were some down grains and

190
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:17,699
if you want to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheer number of</font>

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,010
changes the upper line is heart is

192
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">heartbleed and there is a bump but</font>

193
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,770
there's not as large a bump as you want

194
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,810
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the if you look at the left</font>

195
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">axis there's a tiny number this is for</font>

196
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:37,680
updated non expired certificates that

197
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:39,930
were renewed at least 45 days before

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,359
they expire because you know you don't

199
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">renew your certificate the same day it's</font>

200
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,100
not like oh I better get a new

201
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,190
certificate ah you know hopefully you

202
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,190
plan and you have an infrastructure so

203
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:57,180
the little sad gray hats on these bars

204
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:02,040
are truly sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray hats there are people</font>

205
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:05,638
who went from sha-1 to md5 like we're

206
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,459
bad and we could be worse

207
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:13,750
the little red hats are people who went

208
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,550
from I shot 256 the sha-1 why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

209
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,550
do that I mean why would why would

210
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,920
people do that I mean it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many</font>

211
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:24,000
bunnies and this is top million websites

212
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:30,420
these are websites that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human beings</font>

214
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,959
truly sad oh I'm talking to us what

215
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,089
other domains do we see we are also

216
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,729
looking at certificates in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

217
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Things and so we looked at siemens</font>

218
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,889
smart things and mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends saying</font>

219
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,050
which and this is not the opinion of the

220
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,240
US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indiana University reward</font>

221
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,120
crypto or any other associated entity is

222
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,160
the creepiest thing I have ever seen I

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,139
mean if you do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe me you should</font>

224
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,910
googled it so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smart thing</font>

225
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">siemens certificate they did version 3</font>

226
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,709
which I think we should respect so

227
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:18,279
that's a nice thing I have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

228
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:24,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the signature algorithm sha-1 valid</font>

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:33,339
from January 2015 to 2025 and the public

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:36,339
key is over a thousand bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so i</font>

231
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:41,439
was very surprised to see this and i

232
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:43,240
don't understand what he did it and but

233
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:45,939
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the app</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now we're talking about mother since</font>

247
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:44,100
their their tagline is mother knows

248
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:47,550
everything speaking as an actual mother

249
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,250
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to say i do not know</font>

250
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,899
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do not want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

251
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,910
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so the basic</font>

252
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:00,529
infrastructure is that you have this

253
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,870
little thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like penguin and</font>

254
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:07,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a statement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

255
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,829
body shape of mothers unlike to suna and

256
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,870
all sensor data that is received by the

257
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:16,680
mother from what they call cookies is

258
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:20,459
sent to the cloud and every every mother

259
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,380
is connected to every cookie and so if

260
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these in your kitchen and</font>

261
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,279
then your upstairs neighbor had one in

262
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,230
their bathroom and you put a one of

263
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,019
their USB hubs on say your kids

264
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,070
toothbrush it would go through their

265
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,110
device so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the reason they</font>

266
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,329
justify this is they do have a very good

267
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,360
certificate they do a very careful TLS

268
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:48,569
handshake it was a nice piece of work to

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,089
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session key and on the</font>

270
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,660
authenticated server go from the home to

271
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:57,510
the clown and then they open<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

272
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,540
completely new web socket with no

273
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:09,360
encryption at all and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the data</font>

274
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:11,880
through the new like why uh so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

275
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,470
have any any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether or</font>

276
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:20,100
not your neighbor's kid brushes their

277
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:23,640
teeth you'll you'll have that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

278
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,079
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not talk too fast i left</font>

279
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,160
too much time for questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sorry</font>

280
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,959
the this is my testable predictions that

281
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,480
i am putting on film that

282
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,730
I think we are going to see a standard

283
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,940
traditional web server still using sha-1

284
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,180
and 2020 given how hard it was to get

285
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,230
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of md5 that they by definition will</font>

286
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:50,550
remain until 20 25 but siemens unless is

287
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,470
there anybody here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> siemens and i</font>

288
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,849
think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last observation is not going</font>

289
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,530
to be until 2030 on phones that wild

290
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,980
cards are going to continue until

291
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're made completely unusable and non</font>

292

related publications on this and my

co-author is in the audience and my

295
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:20,760
students all have jobs yay so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me</font>

296
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,540
postdoctoral fellow I have 22 students

297
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:29,040
looking for internships and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

298
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,650
like to close by saying I you is I know

299
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that many of you flew over Indiana to</font>

300
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:39,510
come here we are if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at CS</font>

301
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,939
rankings which we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hack and are</font>

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:50,520
strictly in terms of our publications as

304
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:52,920
as the top you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 and i</font>

305
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,130
am trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together i am putting</font>

306
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,319
together a workshop on pki and IOT and

307
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,180
the goal and one of my goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

308
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,980
submitting this talk is to recruit

309
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who have excellence in crypto and</font>

310
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,360
applying crypto and bring them together

311
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:15,750
with will be in the Seattle area people

312
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:18,089
who are in mist and DHS and also people

313
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,470
who are in the VC community to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,720
come up I mean we have the

315
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,510
infrastructure we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

316
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,180
interfaces like the previous speaker was

317
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,700
saying the developers don't know what to

318
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,490
do and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the incentive</font>

319
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,800
structure so you need all of those

320
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:40,220
things we built an infrastructure where

321
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:43,139
some organizations have interfaces and I

322
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,780
but we don't have the incentives down at

323
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,600
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> even within</font>

324
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,110
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies I mean not just globally</font>

325
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,870
but obviously they did not do code

326
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,919
checking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hideously named mother</font>

327

hub I've been looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing all</font>

328
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:06,590
semester give me a break they are any

329
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:09,080
and the thing and if we don't have those

330
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,209
things the Internet of Things is going

331
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,629
to continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be atrocious so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

332
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,600
my now not so secret agenda please do

333
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,450
email me or give me your card if you

334
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">still use paper so if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in participating in this workshop which</font>

336

we're planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> August so</font>

337
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,670
thank you

338
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,310
so we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for a few questions</font>

339
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:44,110
see item at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic Adam hi so one of</font>

340
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,149
the assumptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think was in your</font>

341
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,490
talk was that fishing site should not be

342
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,410
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get valid certificate but at</font>

343
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,210
least we chrome and probably other

344
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,570
browsers don't actually believe that

345
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">true we don't think CA is a very good</font>

346
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:01,720
places to determine fishing or not and

347
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,370
they can't act fast enough so I I'd be

348
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,290
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right of a fishing it's like</font>

349
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,909
how to certificate we<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on safe</font>

350
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,570
browsing and other technologies like

351
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:13,090
that to clamp down on them so if the

352
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,710
goal of the public key infrastructure is

353
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:20,649
to authenticate a remote web server to

354
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the person engaging with that server if</font>

355
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:29,550
it is indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any way an identity</font>

356
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:36,010
infrastructure the fact that that pki is

357
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:41,409
almost orthogonal to fishing means that

358
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:43,810
it has not met the goals of meaningful

359
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,550
authentication and identification and

360
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:49,060
then that's a really harsh thing to say

361
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:52,389
so if if fishing site has a set for

362
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:56,710
paypal com then I agree entirely that's

363
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,420
a failure but if it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know something</font>

364
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,690
other than paypal calm but is like

365
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,720
pretending to be paypal calm how we are

366
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,000
not looking for the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki to determine</font>

367
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,160
that that other thing is sufficiently

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,080
similar to peak to paypal calm that it

369
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,680
shouldn't exist we have other

370
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,720
technologies to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> act faster I</font>

371
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be the sole role</font>

372
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,240
but if you look at all your user

373
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,490
education it says look for the lock in

374
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,190
the bar look for this lock this is gleam

375
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:31,060
this means it's safe and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> interviewed</font>

376
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:35,200
about 400 people and found out what they

377
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,230
think it means and they the mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

378
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,880
don't know but after don't know there's

379
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:45,940
a fairly close split between insanely

380
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,640
optimistic like it protects from AV and

381
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,440
has a good

382
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,720
privacy policy and this is what you

383
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,610
present the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user and if it is</font>

384
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,040
meaningless and orthogonal to the

385
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:02,330
dominant user threat then I think that

386
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,700
is a inadequate that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm but</font>

387
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to kill the green lock</font>

388
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,950
that's that's the way we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

389
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,510
hi I'm intrigued by the people who

390
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,050
downgraded<font color="#E5E5E5"> there sorry I'm intrigued</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

391
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:24,260
the people who downgraded their

392
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,909
certificates and my own guess is that

393
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,379
the only reason I can think of people

394
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> switched</font>

395
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,930
certificate providers did you explore

396
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,610
that at all good<font color="#E5E5E5"> day there was very</font>

397
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:39,980
little switching of certificate

398
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:42,679
providers I mean we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high level</font>

399
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of consistency over time and switching</font>

400
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,900
certificate providers is it does tend to

401
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an indicator that is to say a feature</font>

402
00:21:50,900 --> 00:22:01,280
that is weighted and valuable in

403
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:08,480
identifying a malicious certificate but

404
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:11,210
I honestly I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the incentives</font>

405
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,540
were to get the fastest cheapest thing

406
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:19,550
we have a real incentive problem in the

407
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure and it's like yes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

408
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:26,899
remove like the the sha-1 fraud recently

409
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fleur</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were a bunch of backdated</font>

410
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,330
certificates it's like having a law

411
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,880
enforcement system where you only have

412
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,679
the death penalty right that you can get

413
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,110
away with a lot before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw</font>

414
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,270
you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the room one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

415
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,699
want to do with these workshops and

416
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,330
interviews and more qualitative work is

417
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:50,570
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a not</font>

418
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:55,310
be you know strict scientific question

419
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:58,220
what are you thinking right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so in</font>

420
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,629
general I we've looked at what people

421
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about certificate</font>

422
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,540
themselves the ones that look for them

423
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,429
put incredibly high levels of trust in

424
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,070
these things if that green bar is there

425
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:13,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is approved by the government it's</font>

426
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,230
safe from antivirus it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get privacy</font>

427
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:21,350
policy people<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe all of these</font>

428
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:23,390
things so building a user-centered

429
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,959
system is difficult building a

430
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,090
user-centered system around system

431
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,430
administrators many of whom<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

432
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,870
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of training or were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the kids</font>

who took care of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage in high</font>

434
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,510
school is another order of difficulty

435
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,620
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much I'm going to I'm going</font>

436
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,120
