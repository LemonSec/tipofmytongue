1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is actually about some</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,939
work that started in the academic world

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,940
when we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make some or looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,980
how to make vaa on<font color="#CCCCCC"> TPM probably secure</font>

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,928
then we thought since we looked at a

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,370
real world crypto scheme it's actually

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,990
it would be nice if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can now get the</font>

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,119
food with secure version back into the

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,680
real world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is basically</font>

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,789
about the journey that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took with this</font>

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,099
work I thought God<font color="#E5E5E5"> would start animals</font>

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,869
education and TPM actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so TPM</font>

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,000
stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for trusted platform module and</font>

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,980
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years could process or some small</font>

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,100
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware but can securely</font>

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,630
create and use cryptographic keys and

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,160
get you 30 cm is that is embedded in a

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,320
larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> system called the host</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font>

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">be computer or smartphone and his men to</font>

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,930
monitor and measure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host so consumed</font>

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,850
for instance may get Titans then of what

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,350
software is running on the host is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,629
host really using keys that are stored

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the TPM and the idea is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the TPM</font>

25
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,120
answers as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a as a root of trust they</font>

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,430
cannot secure the entire phone but if

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,718
you have some trusted ship that tells it

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,239
at everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,220
ok you somehow convinced that the end

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,759
highest one actually does now<font color="#CCCCCC"> em things</font>

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,500
in a secure manner is<font color="#E5E5E5"> law and while you</font>

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,390
can make those hardware based at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">stations who stand on certificates and</font>

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,020
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> its measures from the host the</font>

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,549
problem of that would be that then all

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a very such a station would be</font>

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,320
fully linkable and reveal the identity

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,729
of the TPM and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually would be</font>

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad for privacy because all of</font>

41
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,179
your mail all the time that you want a

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,100
new hardware place vegetation your

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,680
linkable and all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be put</font>

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,539
together so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that kind of raised</font>

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,640
some loud concerns of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,320
community and the good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is here</font>

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,290
that this time the concerns were

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,240
actually heard him acknowledged<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

49
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">been the TCG but it has been computing</font>

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,860
group that standardized and those TTM

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,630
does is they run for protocol that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

52
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,549
called direct anonymous attestation I

53
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,520
must develop exactly for the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,130
is the a protocol basically make self

55
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,469
attestation but an anonymous way so the

56
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,509
very fires still convinced<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it feeds</font>

57
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,298
another station from a certified TPM

58
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,699
like without learning which concrete TPM

59
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,989
has made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter station and lettuce</font>

60
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,238
items are really fully unlink able

61
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,190
unless the host decides otherwise but he

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font>

63
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,850
those expectations of signatures with

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440
respect to the pseudonym and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can</font>

65
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,880
choose three is a fitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> room but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

66
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:25,040
default they will be for the unthinkable

67
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,930
ok the first protocol I said well vector

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,850
done as a joint cooperation of privacy

69
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,610
group cryptographers and the security

70
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,890
experts when these TPM<font color="#CCCCCC"> shirts came out</font>

71
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,020
the first protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them proposed by</font>

72
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,809
brickell combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chen in 2004 and</font>

73
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,510
was adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the T 2g</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and standardized</font>

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TPM 12 to specification of later</font>

75
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,450
honest and ISIL and the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheme is</font>

76
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,820
space and RSA but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the newer version</font>

77
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,950
and the TPM to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 specification they</font>

78
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,500
want to elliptic curve impairing their

79
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,119
schemes for efficiency and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new TPM</font>

80
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,430
interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually also very nice</font>

81
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,350
design was the first ppm suspect was

82
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,420
really hard coded for that one

83
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,220
particular protocol the new one offers

84
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,260
very flexible api's and actually

85
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,240
supports many different da protocols and

86
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,090
some of the protocols also has been

87
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,670
either standardized another social

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,110
sounds erotic<font color="#CCCCCC"> concert concept and some</font>

89
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,869
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specs that nobody uses but</font>

90
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,670
actually ppm or<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips with such TPM</font>

91
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,410
support has been sold more than 500

92
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,269
million times so it's one of the most

93
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,890
kind of complicated protocols with your

94
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,540
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> cruise and everything that is</font>

95
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,880
quite widespread in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world and</font>

96
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">now expect that the interest is actually</font>

97
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,180
kind of growing nowadays because we see

98
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,260
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more applications where you</font>

99
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,970
want to do for instance secure

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,920
authentication with mobile devices or

101
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,690
secure measurements with IOT things

102
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,010
where it's hard to have said secure the

103
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire device but you can put some</font>

trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> ships in there and then boots</font>

105
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,459
shut the security from there and in fact

<font color="#E5E5E5">also the most kind of recent advances in</font>

116
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,359

117
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should have a form of</font>

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,350
security model that really defines what

the adversaries capabilities are and

120
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,719
what he's supposed to do an auto

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,399
scheduling sins what is actually

unfortunately anonymity linkable

123
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,200
amicability formally means and then if

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,419
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> model the scheme</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years of the DA was invented and</font>

135
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,039
actually it had a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good start</font>

136
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,810
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said that was developed by</font>

137
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,360
photographers from the beginning so they

138
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,919
made protocol coming together with the

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,500
form of security model and they proved

140
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,810
this scheme secure in the model however

141
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,449
the scheme<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not as if the former</font>

142
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,740
model was not kind of complete enough it

143
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,870
was losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some features and</font>

144
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,669
functionality in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

145
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,710
missing the capability to actually

146
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,210
output signatures to the verifier which

147
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,739
we might sound a bit weird but basically

148
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,049
verification was<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeled as an</font>

149

150
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">in practice you are not allowed to work</font>

151

152
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,580
store them and to maybe revamp I them

153
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,229

Duran endure too<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplistic way normally</font>

165
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,009
they model signatures as being truly

166
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,050
random values to model that signatures

167
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,840
are not allowed to reveal anything about

168
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,219
to sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> as identity but that is in fact</font>

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,810
way too strong because the signature is

170
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:58,400
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random value at the kill you can</font>

171
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,810
distinguish is clearly from random value

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,669
so actually this model is now way too

173
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,310
strong it could not be realized by any

174
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,960
construction but actually dealing with

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,389
from a model should be a continued they

179
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,060
went to the more established<font color="#E5E5E5"> game based</font>

189
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,940
there were some other follow-up work

204
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,400
the TPM and the hosts are considered to

205
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">be one party and that means that they</font>

206
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
share the same corruption status so

207
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,190
either they're both honors or they both

capture the most interest in case namely

back and have a corrupt host with its

up security but you have to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

213

both are honest which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of renders</font>

there's quite a line of work on form of

security there was not a single security

219

220
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,960
and defined security properties that we

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,360
wanted so we gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a shot and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully got a correct this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we</font>

went for a security mode when you see

framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will not go into any details</font>

225

229
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,890

modeling the signature is random but

231
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,849
creating signatures for random keys

<font color="#CCCCCC">because by that you can prove that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

to the graphics protocol with a FUBU

prove them secure in our model and

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,489
they're basically as efficient as

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,699
much that or is that very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

294
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,529
previous schemes but we only have to fix

295
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,689
details at some few checks and some

296
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">extra crews and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> editors pure elements</font>

297
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,240
with it doesn't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of impact the</font>

298
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,529
efficiency and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal okay but</font>

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's good now right we have now</font>

300
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,970
finally also a secure protocols for four

301
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,350
da<font color="#E5E5E5"> a that is a proven to be secure and</font>

302
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,709
we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is you can secure</font>

303
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,389
implementation of it and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

304
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,579
our protocol is efficient some

305
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,829
particularly the TPM<font color="#CCCCCC"> part was real</font>

306
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,779
lightweight we kind of make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

307
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,540
this is the way we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ambam were to</font>

308
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,110
be done like you just implemented and we

309
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,839
have a secure implementation

310
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,730
and with that mindset we done got in

311
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,040
contact with the TCG but asteroids

312
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,839
computing group that Emma<font color="#E5E5E5"> dices does PMS</font>

313
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice cream okay that would be</font>

314
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,110
extremely nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they could now</font>

315
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,810
implement or support our pool with

316
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,610
sexual versions of the VA when there is

317
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,709
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment I realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that our</font>

318
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,200
understanding of the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

319
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,569
real real rules are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually fully</font>

320
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,700
the same because what we did and also

321
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">what all the previous work in v8 it is a</font>

322
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,959
super treat the TPM as a lightweight

323
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,790
device so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can certainly do anything</font>

324
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,649
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really hard but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can put any</font>

325
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,500
code on it as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it doesn't kind of</font>

326
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,140
require<font color="#E5E5E5"> other computations but in the</font>

327
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,180
real real world the TPM is a piece of

328
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,240
hardware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can only access by a</font>

329
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,040
few and<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited API so how it should be</font>

330
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,810
supported by the TPM it actually should

331
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,990
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to work with those ppl and</font>

332
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,630
widows<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so to standardize okay so</font>

333
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,980
then we had a look on how to ppm

334
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,320
interface is actually look and that's a

335
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">very high level very simplistic kind of</font>

336
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,110
representation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API but the basic</font>

337
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,180
idea is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can generate arbitrary</font>

338
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,440
signature proofs of knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

339
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,239
proof of knowledge you have the

340
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,589
approvers if you can let's head for some

341
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,750
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> key and I want to prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

342
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,610
really has a secret key and the way does

343
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,130
it is first time to random value G to

344
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the art to the verifier then it gets a</font>

345
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,699
challenge or a known as directors

346
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,370
signature proof of knowledge it will

347
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,599
hash the T values with random element

348
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,000
from before and the message of is

349
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,310
supposed to be signed and then compute

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
the final value the S which is R plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

351
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,209
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret key and then the</font>

352
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,779
verifier can check of this is redirect

353
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:44,410
and it's known that<font color="#CCCCCC"> those proofs are</font>

354
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,640
unfortunate and the TPM interfaces

355
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,779
basically kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you an interface</font>

356
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,329
for all the different steps from the

357
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,329
protocols you can create keys you have a

358
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,229
commit interface that gives you the

359
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">system's it should be already have a</font>

360
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,829
hash where you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge and</font>

361
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,959
finally have the sign interface where

362
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,430
you can get or give its input a hash and

363
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,130
the pointer to the randomness of the

364
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,649
first step and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get output</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VES</font>

365
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,640
value and you can already see different

366
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:09,230
than those two things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

367
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,760
actually where the power of the API

368
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,829
comes from the movie in the commitment

369
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,079
of phase you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a gift and</font>

370
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,819
arbitrary point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of generators input and</font>

371
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,560
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those proofs for arbitrary</font>

372
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:22,010
group elements

373
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,699
I said that why the flexibility comes

374
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,779
from and unfortunately our protocols or

375
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because unfortunately they are not</font>

376
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,740
compatible with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those interfaces so they</font>

377
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,870
cannot be wood strips on that but

378
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,370
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a pretty good reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> namely</font>

379
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,290
our protocols were designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way</font>

380
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,420
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not require</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the TPM to the</font>

381
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,819
aesthetic if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle as the</font>

382
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,040
previews<font color="#CCCCCC"> product hosted but because the</font>

383
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,250
inner layer protocols required static if

384
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,199
you have an Oracle TPM is one and we

385
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,600
will now see why this is actually kind

386
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,120
of a bad idea so aesthetically hammer

387
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,160
Oracle means that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the TPM to</font>

388
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,740
compute values p to the s cake for

389
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,209
arbitrary points P and it's not kind of

390
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,560
very immediate live one of the first

391
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,810
call but you can make free calls are

392
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,150
computed as shown on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and it's</font>

393
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really for arbitrary points and the</font>

394
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,100
problem with that is that now a corrupt

395
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,250
host can actually make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in a</font>

396
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,770
special way so it can first call p for p

397
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,660
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> v to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sk then it will get me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

398
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SK to the SP going to take that</font>

399
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,589
point again and it is that as a point P

400
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,480
and then he will get sleep to this race

401
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,490
to the SP to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> S key to the SP enter</font>

402
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,770
on so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get more and more</font>

403
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tuples and I was shown</font>

404
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you have a long sequence of</font>

405
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,620
those values actually computing the

406
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,060
discrete logarithm is much simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

407
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,450
if you would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the value T to</font>

408
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:42,250
the sk it can infect reduces security 4

414
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now if we have 42 protocols which</font>

415
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,720
do not require the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tpms of you static if</font>

416
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,310
you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> oracle anymore how should</font>

417
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,020
they then look like and then to answer

418
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,930
the question we actually were built up

419
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,990
and work by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Theodore who have shown that</font>

420
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,239
in the DA protocols the generators often

421
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,240
have a very specific form and we lay out

422
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,310
the form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> p equals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> y now the</font>

423
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,490
discrete logarithm is known to the issue

424
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a secret key of the issue and the</font>

425
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,500
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is if the point P has such a</font>

426
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,640
form it cannot be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these kind of</font>

427
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,860
attacks things that have shown you

428
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,680
earlier so if it does can be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

429
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TPM only receives</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">point of that structure we can actually</font>

431
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,130
secure to use those points and then the

432
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,740
idea is so that if you prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he has</font>

433
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,390

434
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,279
and that's your knowledge proof so

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,199
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can compute P to the SK</font>

anyone you exercise the vines interface

442
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,290
that takes the generated p and then also

447
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,779

<font color="#E5E5E5">this at all points that have this</font>

452
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,980
sufficient for a basic dia but as soon

453
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">as you want to do some more extension so</font>

in particular signature based revocation

455
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,839
then the streak wouldn't work because

456
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,200
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in signature-based</font>

457
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">revocation is that the ppm has to get or</font>

will get random points<font color="#CCCCCC"> with input bits</font>

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,060
gets it at the moment of vegetation so

461
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,500
when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets but there is no one there</font>

who can make those<font color="#CCCCCC"> proofs anymore</font>

463
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,120
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were not generated by the</font>

466
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,150
point has to be just random there's

467
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,829
actually kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple affixed we can</font>

468
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,630
just instead of giving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment to</font>

469
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,970
face the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct input we give</font>

470
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,740
him some strings and let the TPM derive

471
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,660
the point as the hash of that string

472
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> also then we assure that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

473
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,199
cannot be p to the SI etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so this</font>

474
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,750
was kind of our first proposal to the TC

475
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">jeans that for the new revised TPM</font>

476
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,099
interfaces that get rid of the static

477
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,379
people haven't work on and we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

478
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:26,919
it's not too bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean just some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

479
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,970
lines but then we learned well this is

480
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best because it's a major</font>

481
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,630
revision to the TPM adding new TPM

482
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,129
commands was a big deal because not only

483
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,480
because you have a large consortium that

484
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,580
all have to agree on that but also

485
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,260
because the TPM is really bounded in

486
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,840
terms of memory and that's really costly

487
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,340
and also actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> storing the point P</font>

488
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
because it had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be associated to the</font>

489
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,010
key would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

490
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,010
so the key structure which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

491
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">of significant modification but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

492
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,970
actually the spectrum<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggesting that we</font>

493
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,580
make or part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it commits to interface</font>

494
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,880
that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so but it would only</font>

495
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,290
be okay if with that interfaces if we

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,270
can support everything that was dead

497
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,040
before because<font color="#E5E5E5"> also what we actually</font>

498
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,350
have done now with his first proposal is

499
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,570
we kind of gave now dedicated interface

500
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:16,600
with several protocols which destroys

501
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:19,030
nice design of the TPM interfaces so the

502
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,559
good thing was now we have some TPM

503
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,960
interfaces to work with but<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not</font>

504
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,120
require or that not impose aesthetic to

505
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
see have an Oracle but the bad news<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

506
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,159
that one strain of work all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSW base</font>

507
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,900
teams would not worry quickly

508
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">synthesizes because they heavily relies</font>

509
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,460
on generators that have a special

510
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,050
structure for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issuance horrible so</font>

511
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,670
we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go basically back to the</font>

512
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,059
whiteboard and started kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

513
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word in again and to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest our</font>

514
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,440
own surprise we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get it to work</font>

515
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we had to go quite down in the</font>

516
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,400
triple<font color="#CCCCCC"> layers so really have to change</font>

517
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way in these combinations get</font>

518
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,490
signatures the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters are</font>

519
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,590
chosen and how the issues protocol is

520
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,630
done and basically put the values a bit

521
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,459
upside down but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

522
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,090
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove that scheme than secure</font>

523
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:08,140
under standard assumptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so then</font>

524
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done right we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have revised TPM</font>

525
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,380
interfaces that do not require static

526
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,010
and if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle and we have a</font>

527
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,929
provably secure protocol well we don't

528
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">really done because the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font>

529
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:23,350
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown so far is that where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

530
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:25,450
publicity protocol and we cannot we can

531
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,428
get it to work with those interfaces but

532
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we haven't shown that actually now the</font>

533
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,600
annunciation with those interfaces so

534
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,419
the orchestration of that gives us a

535
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,709
secure protocol so in particular what

536
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,480
still should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shown in the prove the</font>

537
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,200
secure manner is that the TPM based

538
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,520
contributions for the TPM based

signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove of knowledge is</font>

540
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,900
unfortunate and anonymous and then ever

541
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,940
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad news again the interface</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">zero do not allow such proof you cannot</font>

545
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:03,470
prove that the tpms SDKs

546
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,150
portugal and the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

547
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,680
order to do so you have to program the

548
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,300
random Oracle and particularly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

549
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,370
only simulate the sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

550
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,430
program the random Oracle for that hash

551
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,010
value to a special point yeah be tricky

552
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in order to do so you really have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

553
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:26,510
know which half is used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that final</font>

554
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,940
command and here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible</font>

555
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,890
because the host has full access to all

556
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,410
the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so and can make many</font>

557
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,240
hash calls using particular the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

558
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">values so you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milk who went to its</font>

559
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,420
to program the random Oracle such that

560
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:44,600
can simulate these exercises good thing

561
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,360
is the fix that was proposed like CL is

562
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,760
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple namely to just add</font>

563
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,590
a nonce and the hash on the sign

564
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,210
interface and hash the hash again

565
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,800
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the nonce because dan and</font>

566
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,870
the security truth we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

567
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,250
you can wrap program the random Oracle

568
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:05,330
in the moment when the signature should

569
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:09,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">be created so we done Mel right well of</font>

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not if it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple it is</font>

571
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,730
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed by vac see it I'll allows</font>

572
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,150
you to prove on for ability but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

573
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bad for privacy because</font>

574
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,980
now we introduce a very low<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of</font>

00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,780
subliminal channel this nonsense chosen

576
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,110
by the TPM is a part of the final

577
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">signature and now you do not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

578
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,500
is the end really<font color="#E5E5E5"> random or this is</font>

579
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,899
looking random and maybe it's an

580
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,200
encryption of my identity or even my

581
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,790
secret key and you cannot randomize it

582
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">under any higher layer of the protocol</font>

583
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,540
so no matter how good your protocol is

584
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,459
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nonce chosen and that</font>

585
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,240
way you never be sure is it cannot

586
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,080
contain any identifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and</font>

587
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,080
so we suppose the pics to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed</font>

588
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,820
expectancy is that instead of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font>

589
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,010
only by the TPM we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use an arm through</font>

590
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,810
which the host and the TPM contributed

591
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,330
and the looks a bit complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

592
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,010
idea is basically just that we have to

593
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,870
make sure that the nonces are not

594
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,700
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each other so the TPM has</font>

595
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,439
to commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this mount first before it</font>

596
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,060
gets

597
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,590
from the host and also the host<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

598
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,260
allowed to see the noms before it shows

599
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,810
as this one but then we're actually

600
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,450
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so without interfaces we</font>

601
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,159
could prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot only just</font>

602
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,600
would shut the protocol from it but we

603
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,070
can actually do it in a secure way so

604
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,449
the signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> proofs of knowledge</font>

605
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,550
generated with this interfaces are

606
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,780
enforceable and anonymously do not

607
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:33,909
contain any subliminal channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

608
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,620
we finally done with our roadmap or

609
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,020
let's say we in the progress of being

610
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,669
done with the road map because of course

611
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,860
there's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> those changes into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

612
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,210
real world is a kind of long and in SLO

613
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,490
process so some of those changes have

614
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,410
been accepted and animals are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

615
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,200
review and hopefully will be accepted

616
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and the next step is of course</font>

617
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,430
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the PCG to</font>

618
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,919
make sure that or hopeful make sure that

619
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,450
the TPM interfaces are revised and we're

620
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,920
also actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in contact with with</font>

621
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,330
iphone with<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel to make sure that</font>

622
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,090
other specifications or the product

623
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,679
cover the flood are fixed as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

624
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,360
also have made a kind of cytokine

625
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:13,510
station using vaa that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can talk</font>

626
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,550
offline if you're interested and as a

627
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,370
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how to get full with</font>

628
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,770
security in the real world well<font color="#E5E5E5"> first it</font>

629
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,000
comes in really handy if pussy character

630
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,060
and the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> water actually compatible</font>

631
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,580
and it's kind of really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

632
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think in the first step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the first</font>

633
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,300
version but it's good then if you follow

634
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,130
the process into the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

635
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,169
it very likely those require changes to

636
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,340
the model or to the protocol and if you

637
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,810
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's changes</font>

638
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,429
are done on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few of the citywide we</font>

639
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:43,030
better be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to meet ya to make those</font>

640
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:44,140
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I really of course so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much it</font>

641
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,120
gives you should be there from the

642
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,860
beginning to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the</font>

643
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,479
standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything is correct</font>

644
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,100
because now we have iso standards that

645
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,840
are flawed we have TPM interfaces that

646
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,320
have this perfect event if you have an

647
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oracle etc but to be honest we actually</font>

648
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,230
had a lot of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> proofs you from</font>

649
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,180
the start it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just what the proofs</font>

650
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,440
were pretty often wrong or and models

651
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were not kind of complete so I</font>

652
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also have to rethink the way of</font>

653
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,980
how we review those who will do security

654
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules but that's very longer discussion</font>

655
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,500
and your family of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes or</font>

656
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,850
yeah of course that it takes often when

657
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,680
long that I would expect and in

658
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,090
particular it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the kind of</font>

659
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,930
sequential type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

660
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,090
security prove the scheme<font color="#CCCCCC"> any implement</font>

661
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:26,150
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of way more</font>

662
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:30,459
interactive and back and forth ramya<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

663
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,460
theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but that's</font>

664
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:42,760
so we have time from one question for

665
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,350
sorry Nigel do have to sit down I just

666
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,030
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point a good history in</font>

667
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:51,429
that the iso and TCG were told that the

668
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,350
cps<font color="#CCCCCC"> can thing that they standardized was</font>

669
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,800
insecure before they start disturbed

670
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,590
advising it had in addition to TCG was

671
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,879
told that its<font color="#CCCCCC"> api did give them a static</font>

672
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,409
diffie-hellman<font color="#E5E5E5"> oracle and it would</font>

673
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,830
reduce the security of their things and

674
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,630
they chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore the experts but I</font>

675
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,580
mean they wants to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess flexible</font>

676
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,840
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-step support for different</font>

677
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,449
protocols and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this time I</font>

678
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,399
said they will only make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the change for</font>

679
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the API if we can show them that they</font>

680
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> support a different protocol so</font>

681
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,280
basically without giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the second</font>

682
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,360
step of the answer they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon I mean</font>

683
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,600
we still don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

684
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but we have to help them or that yes</font>

685
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,419
to keep it as functional as<font color="#E5E5E5"> working as</font>

686
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:35,250
with the bad CPM state I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim</font>

687
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,250
Nigel didn't actually ask a question

688
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,760
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trying to ask something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

689
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,199
i was gonna cut you off<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know i'm</font>

690
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,900
gradually<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming along it gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule ok alright let's thank</font>

692
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:52,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">unya again</font>
