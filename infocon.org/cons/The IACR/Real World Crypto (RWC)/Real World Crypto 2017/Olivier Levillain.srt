00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,230
providing server authentication and

10

optionally client authentication and

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,719
data confidentiality and integrity so

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,270
it's a basic block of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Security</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">today we are going to look specifically</font>

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,670
at the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages of the of the</font>

protocol that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client hello where</font>

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,780
the client initiates the connection and

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">trot and proposes the different</font>

18

cryptographic features and that hit

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,710
support and then the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,170
server that is the server hello where

the choices are made which Cyprus which

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,620
we will use which version and where the

change with the message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is called</font>

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,880
such occasion that we will look at

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,369
afterward so there are traditionally

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,990
three types of methodologies the EU

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,759
either can do a full ipv4 scan which

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,919
allows you to see a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,960
also can do a scan based on a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,340
the man named with which allows you to

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,289
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sni extension and look at</font>

33
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,390
virtual hosting and if you have access

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,619
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of willing users you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,070
passive observation so in our case we

36
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:41,729
launched several full ipv4 scans in 2010

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,970
11 and 14 and what's interesting is that

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,280
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two first method you can choose</font>

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was about data collection</font>

41
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,860
and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk to you about</font>

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,320
data analysis because the motivation for

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the concept toolkit that I'm going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">present is that when we first worked on</font>

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:12,060
these data we use a pasta salad homemade

unfortunate very script which was cool

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,519
to build to publish an article but three

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,180
years later when I wanted to write my

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,700
PhD manuscript I had I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,200
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> on more recent data and so I had</font>

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,369
some problems with the scripts but also

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,679
with criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> which had adult because</font>

56
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,290
the for example the notion of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> week sweet had a little evolved</font>

58
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,890
between 2012 and 2050 so we also wanted

59
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to include a new external data set like</font>

60
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,660
the one you can get from scans at i/o so

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we built concert or is a way</font>

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,310
to do to go back from the raw data and

63
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:05,209
associated metadata like the client

64
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,440
hello you you use if you get it and

65
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,780
automate all the process so the process

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,659
is to prepare the context the context<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,120
injecting the stimulus you use the

68
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,429
canned hello you use if you have it and

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,389
the trust or the such catcher so you

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,269
want to use to say which<font color="#E5E5E5"> host is</font>

71
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,870
considered to be trusted and we use NSS

72
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,120
in our example then we have to enter the

73
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,190
to inject the answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to pass them</font>

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,410
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extract the subjugate to build</font>

75
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,400
the do to pass the circuit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to build</font>

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,519
all the possible change from the circuit

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,129
messages and then build<font color="#CCCCCC"> produced some</font>

78
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,989
muscle statistics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just and to look</font>

79
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,690
at the data it's always interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

80
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to to know that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Celsius data is</font>

81

not always that clean what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get from</font>

82
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,660
a measurement campaign can surprise you

83
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,760
and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a client hello</font>

84
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,060
proposing<font color="#CCCCCC"> two cycles with the blue one</font>

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,459
and the red the green one you expect to

86
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,650
get either the blue one the green one or

87
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,739
another which would mean that the server

88
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,840
doesn't understand what you wanted to

89
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,199
negotiate but sometimes you find

90
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,478
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly this can be</font>

91
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,300
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's even worse than the</font>

92
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know that the air I say that the</font>

is some servers are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to negotiate</font>

95
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,850
the new surface with which the problem

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,270
is is what does it mean because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

97
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,600
specified we also had a case where our

99
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,949

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message it's just a good message but</font>

101
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,930
you have two missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which might</font>

102
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,440
make you look at your passer and think

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,660
is it me or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> message is incorrect so</font>

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,520
confident that our tool using particle

111
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:22,020
encounter inconsistencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just</font>

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,320
for first simple result about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

113
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:30,210
can get so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about data coming</font>

114
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:35,130
from our campaigns 2011 2014 and the

115
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:38,580
other 31 so the full ipv4 far from 2015

116
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,830
is from scans at i/o and d2 regarding

119

silicon the two is getting some

120
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,240
attention and is finally being deployed

121
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,810
just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget that it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,570
specification that was published in 2008

123
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,440
so we could have better results but at

124
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,389
least it's starting to to to to be used

125
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,710
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to speak mostly about</font>

that is first<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject of the server</font>

131
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,799
and then each subsequent authority that

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,409
will sign the producer ticket and we all

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,020
see you will find another messages we

134
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:34,860
will have find repeated certificates we

140
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,330
what's interesting is that pls 13

141
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,620
relaxes is constraint on the order which

142
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,008
is a good thing because if you look at

00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the quality of certificate chain you see</font>

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,110
was just another resolution concerning

149
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,199
subjugate it was another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you</font>

150
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,509
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get with concert oh it's an example</font>

151
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,810
of such<font color="#CCCCCC"> get message that is not trivial</font>

152
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will explain first what each stuff is</font>

153
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">gray boxes are what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate were</font>

154
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,270
sent by the server so the server sent

155
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,680
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate and in particular</font>

156
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:41,250
it's this one is the server 38 and we

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,240
also have three we also consider three

158
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,669
certificate as trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,539
one aware as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a no we consider them a</font>

160
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,130
stress hood and what concert or gives

161
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,030
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can build a lot of</font>

162
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:00,479
possible certificate change so this one

163
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,219
is a good one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's essentially to do</font>

164
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,860
the better one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get but it's</font>

165
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to see that in this case you</font>

166
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of certification</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

167
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,620
nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the server</font>

168
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,870
certificate so you can find starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

169
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,979
diverse in the subsequent messages that

170
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,990
are sent to build all be possible to

171
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,110
build all responsible such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gate change</font>

172
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,849
possible in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's a little</font>

173
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,150
complex to do that because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

174
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:33,088
<font color="#CCCCCC">two two two problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that will lead to</font>

175
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,510
commit material explosion the first one

176
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,979
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 v1 subjugate because as they are</font>

177
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,990
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not have any extensions you</font>

178
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,529
don't know if they are such HIPAA

179
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,660
thorities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> add until recently they</font>

180
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,760
could be considered as such<font color="#CCCCCC"> gate</font>

181
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,620
authorities so if you have let's say

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">atlantis that</font>

183
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,760
generate the same certificate same

184
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:00,150
subject time<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just differ</font>

185
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,390
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> palicki you should in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

186
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:06,240
try all the possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination if you</font>

187
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to be exhaustive and in fact all</font>

188
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,730
the signature we decide that signature

189
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,290
checks with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a so for this reason we</font>

190
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,210
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into exile one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d1</font>

191
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,699
certificate to match so we only

192
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,010
considered a then as subjugate

193
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,900
authorities when they were in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> chests</font>

194
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:30,210
store which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what brothers do the</font>

195
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,390
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is crazy cross certification</font>

196
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,580
that is you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of certificate</font>

197
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,250
authorities that do cross certification

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,990
and sometimes you have a new dual core

199
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,240
certification which would lead to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycles</font>

200
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,910
which is not the problem does it but

201
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,690
what when you add the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that some</font>

202
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,000
other authorities will emit multiply

203
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:54,660
multiple subjugate with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> palicki</font>

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
same subject but with different value it

205
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,890
very easy days you can have a lot of

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,690
possibilities to choose from when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

207
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,630
can when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to build all the</font>

208
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,970
possible cyber and such get change so

209
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,610
there was different possibilities but we

210
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,240
chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit the number of such case</font>

211
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,420
we took outside of the subsequent

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,590
message when trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build all the</font>

213
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,449
certificate chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have still some</font>

214
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,300
things about the subsea case I will not

215
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,450
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it all of them but this one</font>

216
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,020
is interesting it was in the eff data

217
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,420
from 2010 some server would send<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

218
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,329
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large such kid message</font>

219
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,900
including all its subjugate restore

220
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:44,010
apparently and this is to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

221
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:48,329
questions we had on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wednesday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

222
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:51,870

223
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,510
91<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I ran some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a computed some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

226
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,660

227
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,870
show on a sub skate we also have several

228
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,699
md5 subscribe and this is interesting

229
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,040
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have back from the future or</font>

230
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,990
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex I've an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID for cincy Kate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

231
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is about some of the heavier</font>

232
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,830
in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> campaigns we had we used multiple</font>

233
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,740
stimulate that is we probed the same

234
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,170
server with different simile which

235
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,780
allows us to grasp something into the

236
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:34,729
server behavior which allows us to to

237
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,760
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the insurance on the full itv4</font>

238
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:43,290
space and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards to look at the</font>

239
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,720
sfv to support which led us to compute a

240
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,230
lower bar icon concerning the drums<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,680
RVD because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the 42 44 /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thousands</font>

242
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,490
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP servers https servers in our</font>

243
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,510
campaign from 2014 just would answer

244
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:06,330
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same strategic to ssl v2 down</font>

245
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:08,490
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a way to say</font>

246
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,210
that concert or is today is mostly

247
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,700
stupid it's just a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLC tables</font>

248
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:17,450
and the the real smart parts are in the

249
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">buses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the way we build the</font>

250
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,820
research it change and so we would like

251
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to improve some other stuff like the</font>

252
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend more reports reporting tools and</font>

253
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:33,120
include other data sources like

254
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,340
subjugate transparency for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

255
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,980
in conclusion if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze a</font>

256
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,570
circular diet later we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

257
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,740
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have good quality data</font>

258
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,660
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have today or and we</font>

259
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,120
can reproduce easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> today with the</font>

260
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,230
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> at hand and we should use</font>

261
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,560
methodologies to allow for reproducible

262
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,110
analysis and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do</font>

263
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,560
to to propose something with concert oh

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:04,350
the document the cursor over the source

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation and don't hesitate</font>

clients out there who will advertise

will send ssl v2 formatted client hello

is the statistic here they were

accepting those formatted SLV to client
