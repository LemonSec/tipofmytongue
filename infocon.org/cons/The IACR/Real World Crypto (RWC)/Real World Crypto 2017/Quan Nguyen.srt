00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
okay it is my honor to be here so the

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,648
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top is practically analysis</font>

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,169
engineers so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job is</font>

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,539
conducted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review what it means to</font>

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,619
play the cycle Road in your academic

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,699
papers so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about two</font>

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,550
toughest first one is a shin web

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,439
signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure review and I will show</font>

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,380
you how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> key and complicated design</font>

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,780
can lead to unsay implementation the

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,540
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic is kind of a low level</font>

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,260
primitives gawa<font color="#CCCCCC"> couch mode it's widely</font>

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,629
used it used almost everywhere but then

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,460
its implementation already checked and

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:55,309
then it will show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> two other type box</font>

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,170
that may leak authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> key so</font>

19
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:00,959
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no zero</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day today our</font>

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,110

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,010
fixed a years or some sort of awkward

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,110
recently fixed so we've always thought

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,650
the modern horn lesson that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've learned</font>

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,170
over a year is the encryption input is

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,150
mostly under<font color="#E5E5E5"> our control why the</font>

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,850
description of signature verification

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,189
input is always under<font color="#CCCCCC"> technical job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,960
then we will use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> observation over</font>

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:31,710
and over again to show how to exploit

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,919
crypto box so Jason Jason Webb saucony

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,839
basically generation token but it

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,860
provides signatures of maybe multiple

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,140
signatures it has CDH<font color="#CCCCCC"> Civic eh mark</font>

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,450
encryptions it has different formats the

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,340
formatting will focus on today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">very simple it has a header off a low in</font>

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,200
signatures and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular I will</font>

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,970
tell us where go haul their

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,990
implementation which is widely use the

40
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,570
google active crib and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> swearing okay</font>

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,169
so when I study I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea what does</font>

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,500
in web token is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just read the op C</font>

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,500
and this line really triggered me

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,790
because it states that in the signature

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you embed the top</font>

46
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,379
ki correspond to the signatures so

47
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means that attacker</font>

48
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,268
can just generate a private-public<font color="#CCCCCC"> keeps</font>

49
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,849
hair and then send the public key

50
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,500
together with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature with the hope</font>

51
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,689
that the receiver will<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract the</font>

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,000
pacquiao and use that for signature

53
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,959
verification this is your design level

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,420
mystic biopsy and let's see how it leads

55
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:42,209
to unsafe interment ation sorry so low

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,399
haja enable that feature by default so

57
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,670
any signatures have a public key

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,470
embedded in it by default so just for

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun instead of trying the public key I</font>

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,989
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a schmucky and it it also</font>

61
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,510
accepted I don't even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it means</font>

62
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:03,750
when you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> schmucky together with</font>

63
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:06,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next problem is I look</font>

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,189
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h and implementation in go</font>

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jose and then you know like the first</font>

66
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,209
step is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known attack</font>

67
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,700
invalid curve attack and then for

68
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,919
elliptic curve on this curve you have to

69
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">check whether public key is on your</font>

70
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,729
curve otherwise the attacker can send

71
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,489
your public key on a different curve

72
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,590
with a small other and then it can

73
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,959
usually remainder theorem to extract the

74
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,690
private key and then go hotel doesn't

75
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,970
have any checked one of the reason is

76
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,430
Joe implementation doesn't have this

77
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,590
idiot so the developer has to do it

78
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,780
themselves and you can guess that they

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:46,739
with this critical check goals are also

80
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,169
have t be th mark the H max is computed

81
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,139
over a ed non in psycho tech and the

82
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">last pay attention to last component the</font>

83
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,900
last component actually makes the

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,010
boundary between 80 and non unambiguous

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,900
and then I find a few integers flow but

86
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,819
then I want to exploit it I don't know

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,069
how to turn into the flow and go into

88
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,708
remote code execution but how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

89
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">map</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I pass so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is you want to</font>

90
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,329
you want to shift the battle between 80

91
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:22,169
and none so assuming attack to observe

92
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,480
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> 16 vine a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ad some nuns and then</font>

93
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,120
some laughs architects

94
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,150
what attacker can do is it will create a

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,870
new set of iid<font color="#CCCCCC"> where if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you pay</font>

96
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,630
attention because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ed side is too big</font>

97
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,000
when you multiply by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 it will be 64</font>

98
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,310
because of integer overflow so basically

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,250
the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is a checker already</font>

100
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,670
create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new set of AD noon on new cycle</font>

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,680
tracks and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H mark is the same</font>

102
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:53,750
so basically causing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ashmac</font>

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication bypass the last topic in</font>

104
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,780
go Jose is<font color="#E5E5E5"> support multiple signatures I</font>

105
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,940
rarely seen the real practical use<font color="#E5E5E5"> K to</font>

106
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,539
actually use multiple signatures but

107
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,910
then it in RFC so the developer has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,560
develop it so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

109
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,360
signature verification the it<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,190
whether one of the signature is invalid

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,980
then the method just<font color="#CCCCCC"> return</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload</font>

112
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:22,130
and what's wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that the problem</font>

113
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,880
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signatures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not only covered</font>

114
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pillow but also the protected header</font>

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,500
integrity of the header so what the

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,140
attacker can do is a similar observe of

117
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,960
valid signatures and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid header and</font>

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:41,000
valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> Palos what it does it create a new</font>

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,030
invalid header and invalid signature and

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,430
then it will send them together with the

121
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,710
valid one now the victim called a very

122
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,690
famous have it check whether one of the

123
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,219
signature is valid where the second

124
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,400
signature is valid because what the

125
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:59,450
circle<font color="#CCCCCC"> observed on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wire so the so</font>

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,510
the victim will wrongly assume that the

127
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:08,000
first the first header is valid which

128
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:10,670
may contain the revocation key<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,390
let's move on to go walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alta mode this</font>

130
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,420
is kind of a primitive low primitive

131
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,969
that said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also do a security will</font>

132
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,860
review form so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will cause most kind</font>

133
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,250
of fracture there are fewer attack in

134
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">academic but like when I first so that</font>

135
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,730
it seems that like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at</font>

136
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,859
its implementation so for recap the gala

137
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,790
couch mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> has encryption key in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">increased every time modular to to the</font>

142
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,860
32 this is important and then we'll come

143
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to it later the authentication pack</font>

144
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,810
is basically if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,030
the coefficient is the ciphertext<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

148
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,580
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at one of the often</font>

149
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">tercel rapper because we know don't want</font>

150
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,659
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use open to sell directly so</font>

151
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,240
we write open to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapper someone</font>

152
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,490
wrote it you know the state officers

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,830
that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to configure what is the</font>

154
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,280
expected length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the authentication</font>

155
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,859
tag so the safe one is you say hey one

156
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,809
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 by our tragic authentication tag</font>

157
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,660
or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel by depends on the</font>

158
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,300
application but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rapper does is</font>

159
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,640
it get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authentication tag that is</font>

160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,040
received on the wire and use it to

161
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,320
configure the expected length of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,940
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag so what it means is</font>

163
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,800
that actor just send one bite

164
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,350
authentication tank then the rapper will

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,630
happily accept it you may wonder why

166
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,110
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not Hector just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send 0 bytes</font>

167
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,150
well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> open sisters are just</font>

168
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,580
revenge 0 by authentication tab so one

169
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:03,859
byte works nicely another problem is a

170
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,810
SF before the counter mode you actually

171
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">work in modular to 232 so if after 22 32</font>

172
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,180
clocks the channel will be wrap around

173
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,609
causing counter collisions and encounter

174
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,430
more if you have if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have counter</font>

175
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,500
collisions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italy clamtxt and in DCM</font>

176
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,890
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> counted collisions you also</font>

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">licks the authentication key so this</font>

178
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,690
issue is different from the ivory you

179
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:34,190
issue because it happened even if users

180
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:37,190
use a different ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then let's</font>

181
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,740
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a make a check for open source</font>

182
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">elkin trip and then battle cancer and up</font>

183
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,780
until ka mid<font color="#CCCCCC"> discreet each critical</font>

184
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,850
check and then it's especially danger in

185
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Java</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher because you stream</font>

186
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:54,920
api meaning you can encrypt last fire by

187
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,990
calling a grip<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm ok the last box i</font>

188
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,779
will talk about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic timing</font>

189
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,670
vulnerability openjdk so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

190
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,069
this it looks similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ash mark</font>

191
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,889
vulnerability basically it compared by

192
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:10,729
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite and if you see the first unmatch</font>

193
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:13,339
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will throw an exception</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so ok</font>

194
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,740
basically it allows you to other five

195
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,810
powers of syndication one for particular

196
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:22,850
cycle tracks but I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> more I want</font>

197
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:25,399
authentication key so let's remind of

198
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,160
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> anthems you for being an IV attack</font>

199
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this works on encryption input under</font>

200
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,949
user control early and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not it</font>

201
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploitable in practice and basically</font>

202
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:41,180
need already fixes in 2007 but I remain

203
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,670
remind us that decryption input is under

204
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,609
attack essential so let's see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

205
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,639
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploited so the attacker choose</font>

206
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,009
collided IV in description basically the

207
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,529
attackers and two pairs the first k IV

208
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:58,490
and c1 the second phase IV in situ and

209
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:02,750
then c1 XOR C 2 is one in particular is

210
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:07,279
just use very simple simple pelo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ve 0</font>

211
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:10,040
C 1 is 0 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> T 2 is one and using the</font>

212
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,139
timing attack the attacker can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

213
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,420
authentication tag of these pair so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

214
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,180
write that equation for you so basically

215
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,029
what it means is if your ex or the

216
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,060
authentication tag together then you

217
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:29,709
have h square and then fighting a square

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">root in involve you is enough to find</font>

219
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:36,138
fih so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means if you</font>

220
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,750
just make a small mistake similar to a

221
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:42,769
schmuck one then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you basically lick the</font>

222
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:47,300
authentication key I have an extra box

223
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:50,560
but probably is better for questions

224
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,560
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your attention</font>

225
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:03,449
ok any questions for quan i guess not

226
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,619
well I guess you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be around</font>

227
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,479
so if you want to talk to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

228
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:07,740
coffee break you can do let's thank

229
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,519
climb one more time thank you

230
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,519
[Applause]
