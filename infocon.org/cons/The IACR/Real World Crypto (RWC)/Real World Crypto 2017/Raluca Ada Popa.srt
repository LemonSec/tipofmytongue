00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,319
about the other side with respect to the

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,599
previous talk namely a constructive site

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,509
so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we build better and better</font>

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,580
systems how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we provide more and more</font>

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,710
security guarantees while having the

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,359
practical system and that's very

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,430
challenging but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,289
one step at a time and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,019
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two steps in this direction</font>

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,180
miler and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Verena and this is joint work</font>

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,390
with my wonderful collaborators some of

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,820
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are here as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the problem</font>

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,390
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at is the fact that</font>

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,070
web server could be compromised and

16
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,050
confidential data can leak for example

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have the web server stored in a</font>

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,809
cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hacker breaks in and</font>

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">steals a snapshot of the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> miler and</font>

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Verena aim to improve confidentiality</font>

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,309
and integrity in the face of compromised

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,160
web server so to understand the systems

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,218
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about this the following</font>

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,858
security spectrum on the left side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,290
have today's systems so that process

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,360
data in the cryptid form so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,200
attacker breaking into the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all the data so everything</font>

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaks a first big step towards more</font>

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,439
security is to be encrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,020
end-to-end encryption sensitive fields

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,669
for example the developer can say that

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,130
the medical history in this medical app

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,659
is sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and encrypting it with</font>

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,949
end-to-end encryption will make a big

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,360
step forward this is particularly this

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,979
particular relevance to passive

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,430
attackers that just get a snapshot of

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,250
the data and can see that the end that

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,049
the synthetic oils are encrypted but

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,909
then we have active attacks that can

42
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,210
compromise the server in arbitrary ways

43
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,460
and an important step towards security

44
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,439
for these attackers is to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attacker cannot compromise the</font>

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,839
client-side code because client-side

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,820
code has access to the cryptid data and

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,350
in the web setting this is not so

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,320
trivial because the client side code

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,960
comes from the server who's compromised

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,728
another important another important

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,318
aspect is to make sure an active

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,930
attacker does not tamper with key

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,268
distribution because keys can decrypt

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,950
another property going forward towards

56
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,140
more security is to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow any</font>

57
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,268
tampering from the attacker no tampering

58
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,809
with data no tampering with computation

59
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:27,120
and results of computation then yet

60
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,219
another step is to hide metadata so no

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,930
just the sensitive fields but the

62
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about them such</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as who has</font>

63
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,359
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what then we also have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

64
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:38,069
pattern how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hide access patterns</font>

65
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:41,040
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> computation as well during search</font>

66
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,379
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and this is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to do</font>

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,540
today in a practical way because we know

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orion based techniques are quite</font>

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,269
healthy and quite slow and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

70
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this miscellanea of topics that also</font>

71
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,639
leaked and we would like to hide them

72
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,590
and those are what operations are you

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,319
running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data what's the wrong</font>

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,090
time when are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you running a query the</font>

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,760
data size and structure and these are

76
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,769
very hard to hide as well because many

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">times they involve worst-case adding and</font>

78
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,319
that can bring a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of performance</font>

79
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,418
overhead but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can hide all of these</font>

80
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,000
then we can give very strong security

81
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm not saying perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's</font>

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,629
always usability concerns and

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,959
assumptions we make what you can get

84
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,879
very very strong security so

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,699
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> today we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how to</font>

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,548
build practical systems systems with

87
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,519
this target security we have a bunch of

88
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,650
relevant tools in theory such as or my

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">garbage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ram and fhe but they are too</font>

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow for practical systems building a</font>

91
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,689
practical system is much more

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,228
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenging and we've been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

93
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:51,478
steps at a time now each step

94
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:53,729
contributes a constructional property on

95
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,810
top of what existed even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it doesn't</font>

96
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:00,449
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you perfect security so I've done a</font>

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of work along this spectrum and let</font>

98
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,069
me tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today about two systems</font>

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,019
smiler and arena my alert provides

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,509
end-to-end encryption / annotated field

101
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,729
and against the attacker that

102
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:14,790
compromises everything it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

103
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,280
guarantees one that the attacker cannot

tamper with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client side code and the</font>

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,010
tries to prevent the attacker from

tampering with the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40</font>

109

113
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,760
fresh off the press we have a new system

114
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,400
opaque that's propelling the camera

115
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,650
ready for that actually hides all

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,010
leather data and hides access patterns

117
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,500
including during computation opaque is

118
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,260
based on oblivious algorithms combined

119
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,060
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cliffs and if you're</font>

120
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,510
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then I can come next</font>

121
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,940
year and tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but opaque</font>

122
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,030
focuses on data analytics so not the web

123
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,380
setting and there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

124
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges to address in the web setting</font>

125
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,990
so there's a bunch of to do left here

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,909
although expect that some of the

127
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,370
techniques from opaque will apply to the

128
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,910
web setting because of tech support rich

129
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,670
functionality and for the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> category</font>

130
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's big question mark we're not clear</font>

131
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,200
how to hide that information and

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:36,870
efficient way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

133
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,550
now about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maya and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lorena smiler is the</font>

134
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,530
webstream work that protect sensitive

135
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,260
data fields with end-to-end encryption

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,330
the developers specify which are

137
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,760
sensitive fields for example private

138
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,310
message in a chat and the browser

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,990
encrypt these fields and give the

140
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,290
encrypted data to the server so for

141
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,540
example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> alice has encrypted sensitive</font>

142
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,310
data the browser encrypted if it's a

143
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,530
sensitive field that was marked by the

144
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,110
developer and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it encrypted to the</font>

148
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,920
decryption key from the browsers and

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,240
when Alice tracklist is the data the

152
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,200
stimulus<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher work has already</font>

153
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,550
proposed encryption the web setting

154
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,219
however they were far from sufficient

155
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,650
for using real web apps for a few

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,990
reasons first we show that the common

157
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,820
web framework such as genuine Ruby on

158
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,270
Rails is not compatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> with encryption</font>

159
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,800
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose a different architecture</font>

160
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,560
second in these systems

161
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,449
these are sharing with burdensome users

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">had to do manual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key distribution many</font>

163
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:48,960
times third<font color="#E5E5E5"> their active attacks on</font>

164
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">client site source code and key</font>

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,008
distribution that can lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

166
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,419
significant data leakage and finally

167
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,810
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no support for efficient a</font>

168
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:01,830
server-side search similar address these

169
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,720
challenges and in this talk I can only

170
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,030
tell you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level about two</font>

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent active</font>

172
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,020
attacks on key distribution and how do

173
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">you add support for search server side</font>

174
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,549
alright so the API in my allure is that

175
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,490
the developer says which fields are

176
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,370
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and minor is going to encrypt</font>

177
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:27,659
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> milor does not protect anything</font>

178
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,400
else the developer defines the access

179
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,930
control so who has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those</font>

180
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,419
encrypted fields using a principal graph

181
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,599
so the principal graph looks like this

182
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:43,080
alexia chat application the developer

183
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,349
specified that Alice Bob you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat work</font>

184
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,020
and chat partier principal and the edges

185
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,830
denotes axis<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice and Bob has</font>

186
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,568
access to the chat work and no one else

187
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,190
each of these principles<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the field</font>

188
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,770
actually multiple keys but swing

189
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,919
covertly and this case I actually stored

190
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,568
the server encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> then clip it with</font>

191
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,549
key chains which I won't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how</font>

192
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,789
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but the property they give you</font>

193
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,500
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the user that have access</font>

194
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,599
to in the principal graph can actually

195
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,110
the crib the key the only Alice and Bob

196
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:18,659
can get access to the green key and now

197
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,949
the information inside each cat is

198
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:25,580
encrypted with the key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chat</font>

199
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,930
however there can be an active attack or

200
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,568
distribution when a user looks up at you

201
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,490
so consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Bob wants to write some</font>

202
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:37,110
text in the chat work<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so he needs to</font>

203
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,579
touch the green key from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server so</font>

204
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,110
he tells the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok give me the green</font>

205
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:42,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">key give him the key for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chat work</font>

206
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,709
but the seller is malicious might give

207
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:49,469
him the<font color="#CCCCCC"> purposely and as a result of</font>

208
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,729
that bomb<font color="#E5E5E5"> my encrypt the data in</font>

209
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,120
why that it can see it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

210
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you intended to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect against</font>

211
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,800
this attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> miler certified skills</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

212
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,570
for example the green key certified by

213
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alice so she produces a digital</font>

214
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,870
signature saying this green tea

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,510
corresponds to the chat work<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok bye</font>

216
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:14,310
Alice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> minor support arbitrarily long</font>

217
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:17,640
certificate passed similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

218
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:21,030
the problem though is that ok now when

219
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,040
Bob checks touches the key he can check

220
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,770
the digital signatures on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid how</font>

221
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,480
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob smile our clients know that</font>

222
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,600
he's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check back me against</font>

223
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,340
Alice's signature as opposed to someone

224
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,790
else's signature for example it can also

225
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:39,960
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chat work early Bob knows that</font>

226
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:43,709
she wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chat work with Alice ok so</font>

227
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,830
bob has to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smiler and for this</font>

228
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,830
reason in my life principles have human

229
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,560
meaningful names the developer is

230
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,540
supposed to display the certification

231
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,420
path for every relevant principle that

232
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user might give data to for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

233
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,310
in this case we have three available

234
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,170
chat rooms one is work created by Alice

235
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,020
that's the certifications<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for work</font>

236
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,849
world created by if anyone can create a

237
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,630
chat with the name work especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> via</font>

238
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,100
malicious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> past divided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and the</font>

239
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,500
user is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose the work by</font>

240
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alice that's all he wants to input his</font>

241
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,020
data she wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to Alice then</font>

242
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,000
miler can check that the green<font color="#CCCCCC"> indicate</font>

243
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,829
he gets from the server is certified by

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,370
aliens and you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tricked into</font>

245
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,770
accepting the purple key ok so to

246
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,060
prevent against this active attack we

247
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:38,490
made an explicit design decision that is

248
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,250
that miner does not hide the name of the

249
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,500
principal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and does not hide what</font>

250
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,990
principles have<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch hey we</font>

251
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,390
want any users any of their coming in

252
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,790
and wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give access to a</font>

253
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,970
principal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some data to know who that</font>

254
00:10:50,790 --> 00:11:00,060
principle is who gets to see it who

255
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:02,670
certifies it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the second part about</font>

256
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">milan i wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is search</font>

257
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,199
so minor provides searchable encryption

258
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,729
as a separate package from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

259
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,560
miler system and it works by the

260
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">developer specifies the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field of</font>

261
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,810
searchable then minor is going to enable

262
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,330
searchable encryption for that one and

263
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,400
we have an access control function is

264
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,780
very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> here allow search that</font>

265
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,400
controls who can see search<font color="#CCCCCC"> words ok so</font>

266
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,100
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me tell you how miler does search</font>

267
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,430
first let's consider using the standard

268
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,400
searchable encryption you tokenize every

269
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,040
chat into keywords and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> bob</font>

270
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,990
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's say society</font>

271
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,790
has to give a token for each one of

272
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,920
those chat with each one of those kids

273
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,959
and then using regular searchable

274
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,420
encryption the server see that there's a

275
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:57,150
match or that there is no match and we

276
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:01,530
we built and the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font>

277
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:03,449
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mentioned the client has to</font>

278
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,160
generate tokens for each one of these

279
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,470
chats which could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> buryin something to</font>

280
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,719
be very much nicer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate only one</font>

281
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,450
token and that's basically what a miler

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,870
contributes here so minor give the

283
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,510
server a delta which allows the server

284
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,430
to convert so an encryption of SSN into

285
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,590
an encryption with two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> fees</font>

286
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,650
and that is just regular suitable

287
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,910
encryption from their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and because</font>

288
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,740
mine are built on our searchable

289
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,230
encryption it has the same properties

290
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,570
the same leakage patterns a searchable

291
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,040
encryption namely that the server is

292
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to know that those the first match</font>

293
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,339
there and then there was no match and

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were no matches ok so the server</font>

295
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to see the matching starts</font>

296
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,440
pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so to indicate the amount of</font>

297
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,330
information that scene in a multi-user

298
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160
setting we designed specifically to

299
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,650
allow search function so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed it</font>

300
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,189
for the following attack which we

301
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:59,459
described in the mylars paper the

302
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:02,070
attacker compromises the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

303
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,310
tiger creates a principle called tackle

304
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,850
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key so he has the key for the</font>

305
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:11,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle it gives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob Bob</font>

306
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,560
generates<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Delta automatically and</font>

307
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,469
then when Bob searches for assistant

308
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,449
attacker can convert that

309
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,040
into an encryption under the Red Sea

310
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,500
that's what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> delta enables you to do</font>

311
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then can mount a dictionary attack</font>

312
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,880
okay just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker has the red</font>

313
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,230
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> mount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dictionary attack and</font>

314
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,600
figure out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSN is what's encrypted</font>

315
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,640
and then the attacker is going to say

316
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,200
that oh that matches in other documents

317
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,600
as well just by the searchable

318
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,640
encryption functionality so because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

319
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,860
were aware of these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we designed</font>

320
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the allow such functions specifically</font>

321
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,110
for it the point is that a user should

322
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,240
not automatically give the Delta to

323
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,160
anyone reading the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxis the Delta</font>

324
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,030
should only be given to trustworthy

325
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,400
principles ok so the developer must call

326
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,470
allow search on<font color="#E5E5E5"> tribology principles</font>

327
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,959
sometimes it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as the user do you</font>

328
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,880
trust me you trust this principle this

329
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,990
person to know your search queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

330
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,600
you fine if they know your search

331
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,980
queries or other times the developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

332
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,690
just figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the application</font>

333
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,060
logic for example the boss and have the

334
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">law search</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

335
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,560
the attacker should not get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta ok</font>

336
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:25,250
so the allow such make sure that only

337
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,729
trustworthy principles get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

338
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:31,820
queries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of this the packer</font>

339
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,490
and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the attacker</font>

340
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,560
cannot take that his boss or doctor

341
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,320
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> miler certifies principles as we</font>

342
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,790
just described<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so because of all-out</font>

343
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,070
search the sackers not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font>

344
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:47,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">delta and he's not going to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

345
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:50,510
query what was searched all right so

346
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,770
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for security spectrum here's</font>

347
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:57,290
where miler life and its natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> by now</font>

348
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:00,290
to discuss the previous cell paper but

349
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,209
that pole presented the very first point

350
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not so clear in the</font>

351
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,430
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that miner does not</font>

claim to provide full confidentiality

353
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,199
perfect security hey the paper has a

354
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,900
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places where clearly says tax</font>

356
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,150
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope ok now looking at the three</font>

357
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,219
leakage scenarios that grabs the value

358

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,259
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope and the third we believe it</font>

360
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,029
does not work if you use miler correctly

361
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,979
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say that even if things</font>

362
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,529
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope they're still useful right</font>

363
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:36,779
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my security spectrum right we</font>

364
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,459
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the way there we want to</font>

365
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,379
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these properties so by all</font>

366
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,138
means even out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope attacks are</font>

367
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,399
useful but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to be aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

368
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,289

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually affect what the system gives</font>

370
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:52,729
you so concretely if we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical</font>

371
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:55,109
application listing miler encrypts the

00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:57,089
medical history of each patient<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

373
00:15:55,109 --> 00:16:03,239
it protects the contents of the medical

374
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:06,749
history<font color="#CCCCCC"> milor does not protect that dr.</font>

375
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:10,109
Alice can see Bob's medical history<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

376
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:12,899
that explicit design decision that we

377
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:15,539
made that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be known who has</font>

access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for certifying principles</font>

379
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:20,910
as we discussed second miler does not

380
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:24,299
prevent does not protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

history<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and protecting that is</font>

383
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:31,049
really hard to do efficiently we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

384
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:33,959
am based techniques are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very slow so</font>

385
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:36,419
most most practical systems on the sex

386
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,279
act leakage<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mile gives you is</font>

387
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,489
the fact of the content of the medical

390
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:49,649
that we described in our miler paper the

391
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:53,039
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just showed you it has the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

392
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,399
seven technical steps and we designed

<font color="#CCCCCC">allowed specifically to stop this attack</font>

394
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,649
okay so it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same attack we were</font>

395
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,168
aware of in 2014 and we designed a lot

396

<font color="#E5E5E5">more details</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step by step please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

398
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,668
look at the mylars website<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

399
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">going back to our security specs on this</font>

400
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:16,379
is where the attacks of the object I'll

401
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,539
are they don't affect the two steps of

securities<font color="#CCCCCC"> miler give you they're still</font>

403
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,720
very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all</font>

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,010
the way there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we want to understand</font>

405
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,590
what we have left to do speaking of

<font color="#CCCCCC">let's loop let me make another step</font>

407
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,370
forward in this spectrum and tell you

wider class of active attacks than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Milo</font>

414
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:54,540
did and when I was designed for Milo it

415
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,760
has the same architecture so it was

designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with minor in mind for example</font>

417
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:04,410
it's the attacker if the server removes

418
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,660
one of the users from a ban list then it

419
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,310
might be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case that later some user</font>

420
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,250
gives access to that banned user because

421
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:14,760
we know he was banned and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's</font>

422
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,910
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care of pampering for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Reina is that the web servers can be</font>

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,640
server and you have a doctor that

434
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,140
analyzes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to give a diagnosis there</font>

435
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,590
for example a doctor wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">average heart rate for Alice in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,629
varina the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to prove</font>

441
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:09,449
the result is correct and what do I mean

442
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,000
by correct well if the doctors check

443
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:15,320
this proof and the proof was correct

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,080
then the doctor is guaranteed that the

445
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,520
data was only changed by Alice so the

446
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,250
heart rates come from her to write

447
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:28,230
access control that the data was

448
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:30,720
complete no sample was removed that it

449
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,650
was fresh lettuce and that the average

450
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,300
was computed correctly there's been a

451
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,590
bunch of other work that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

in order to bypass this impossibility

471

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so for example in this subtree 150</font>

it vanilla is going to compile the

535
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,770
complicated query and let's see how

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Verena handle this we want the average</font>

537
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,750
rate so a joint<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're joining two tables</font>

538
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,490
patient lists and patients okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

539
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,070
patient's list we want the patients with

age greater than 70 and for each one of

541
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,659
them we want their average heart rate in

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interval so what we have that</font>

543
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,429
is it goes the server both<font color="#CCCCCC"> through all</font>

563
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:28,579

of compromised servers we open source

miler and we plan to open first opaque

as well hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will help the</font>

570
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:47,599
can make one step at a time and each

that there's a bunch of really cool work

00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,509
left to do and hopefully this session

576
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:08,478
will get you interested in working on it

577
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:13,999
so thank you so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

578
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:15,589
questions hi there on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your slides</font>

579
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:18,559
in the middle of the mylar portion of

580
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:21,668
this you suggested that users could

581
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:26,479
select which principles they wish to

582
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:28,969
trust I after decades in this field I

583
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:32,059
have been unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a deployed</font>

584
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:34,279
system in which this works users are not

585
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,319
capable of making security decisions so

586
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,749
far as I can tell and if you leave

587
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,629
security decisions to users systems fail

588
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:43,519
and and and when I was young and<font color="#CCCCCC"> naive I</font>

589
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:45,529
I actually believed in constructing

590
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,839
systems on the principle that you could

591
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:50,539
let users make decisions like this and I

592
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,940
have long since been disabused by by

593
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,799
bitter experience yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

594
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that a lot of users don't make the</font>

595
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,819
right decisions and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost none</font>

596
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:00,589
I mean BP number you can you can

597
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,389
basically guarantee that you know

598
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,309
perhaps a fraction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a percent of users</font>

599
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:07,849
will make the correct and and I also

600
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:10,579
agree that it's not necessarily easy it

601
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:13,189
sounds somewhat inherent because we need

602
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:17,448
to know what the user wants who do they

603
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,099
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give access to and whatever</font>

604
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:21,289
they're looking is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will use</font>

605
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:23,869
this kind of system for critical

606
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,519
applications where hopefully they could

607
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:27,649
be more educated than be more incentive

608
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyes I agree with you that it's hard to</font>

609
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:33,270
make these decisions correctly but I

610
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:34,500
don't know any

611
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,530
the better technique because the user

612
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,660
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convey to us what principle they</font>

613
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,820
mean at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's</font>

614
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,560
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more work on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

615
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,090
in on the usability studies maybe they

616
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,639
don't select the path maybe you make

617
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,139
sequence of pages be so natural that

618
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,140
they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right place that would</font>

619
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,310
use ability to work click point on let

620
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,720
me just time to intervene for a moment

621
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already eight minutes</font>

622
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,270
late for our excellent sandwiches so if

623
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,130
you could keep the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex in and</font>

624
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,560
also try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the answer's no that</font>

625
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,690
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much appreciated thank you so I</font>

626
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,919
have a short philosophical question

627
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,630
you're saying this is better than

628
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing because you're protecting and</font>

629
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,010
summit at even it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all but it's</font>

630
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,810
also more dangerous than nothing because

631
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,160
if people have false trust that the

632
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,409
system is good they're going to put all

633
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,090
the vulnerable information and use it

634
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,560
with extra trust so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

635
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear what you think about that so I</font>

636
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,980
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the user should not have this</font>

637
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,930
post feeling I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they have to be</font>

638
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,580
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be informed right we're</font>

639
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,470
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an to an encryption for phils</font>

640
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,179
you mark sensitive we don't hide

641
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:45,030
anything else they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be informed</font>

642
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:49,080
right now building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comprehensive</font>

643
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:52,950
secure system is the CC seek and hard

644
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:58,080
task yes and what you what you call

645
00:27:52,950 --> 00:28:02,550
users call them highly trained better on

646
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,790
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> experts because it's not sorry</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bush it's not like you don't</font>

648
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:11,490
have a sociate some primitive in

649
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,070
cryptography disease like you know your

650
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,560
knowledge proof if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added to an input</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I verified in any context I can do</font>

652
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,429
it it's a very robust and you can you

653
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,280
can put it in you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be an</font>

654
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:26,880
expert if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system that is</font>

655
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,760
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swiss cheese it covers certainly</font>

656
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">but his world you need really experts to</font>

657
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,210
know where is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole and where is not</font>

658
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,270
the mall and how the system is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

659
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">pee you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to monitor it all the</font>

660
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,580
time where you violate the the cheese

661
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,539
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hole it's very</font>

662
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,460
complicated but in

663
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:47,229
insert it it's not revived in the in the

664
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,979
sense security is not going to be

665
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:54,999
maintained and I think don't use users

666
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:58,149
use experts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that users have to</font>

667
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,859
be they have to be careful here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

668
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:01,629
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanna say that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applies to</font>

669
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">many other systems we have today right</font>

670
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:05,168
so whenever you have enjoined encryption

671
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,119
they need to understand that they don't

672
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">protect access patterns or metadata</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

673
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,949
so this is not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to</font>

674
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,720
miler pretty much every practical system

675
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,849
has something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that offers and some it</font>

676
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,769
does not and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a mistake to</font>

677
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,999
think that it gives you all the security

678
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,470
guarantees there because there's always

679
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be things outside of the threat</font>

680
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,460
model and the second point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanna make</font>

681
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,379
is that we absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work on</font>

682
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,379
usability of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems thinking how</font>

683
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:32,649
to make them usable how to make users

684
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:34,539
not mistake and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> require some work</font>

685
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's complementary to miler right now</font>

686
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,690
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how can</font>

687
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:39,639
you technically do this before my larger

688
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:45,700
wasn't enter an encryption embedded with

689
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:49,119
web apps at all sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question</font>

690
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,099
about the searchability you don't

691
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,289
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reverse index on the server</font>

692
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,519
instead we're tripping each term with

693
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:56,710
some randomness and that's why these

694
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,080
attacks that reveal the order of

695
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,059
keywords work what's the difficulty with

696
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,389
reverse indexing know so you can totally

697
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,190
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally actually randomize the</font>

698
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:08,559
order for each document you don't have

699
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,049
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in document order and we</font>

700
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,460
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a reverse index</font>

701
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:14,379
implementation as well and that reverse

702
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,239
index index is done based on encryption

703
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,189
so in some sense they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

704
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:23,799
randomized already so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not reveal</font>

705
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:26,649
the order yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we actually we're</font>

706
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,340
out of time so let's thank frolic on all

707
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:30,399
the figures

708
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,399
you
