00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,740
this George we work on the cultural

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,190
cryptography team Alex who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote most of</font>

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,570
the code is around here somewhere and

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:16,859
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk about how to</font>

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,380
solve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cultural caption now to solve</font>

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,140
the cultural capture you click the boxes

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,869
with the street sign you have to be

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,320
careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to click the boxes with a</font>

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,710
pole at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base or any other sign that</font>

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:45,809
might be in the picture Oh clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then I'm done okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but seriously</font>

13
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,250
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about solving the problem</font>

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,620
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudflare CAPTCHAs and in fact</font>

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,590
while CAPTCHAs like that may seem pretty

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,809
straightforward they embed a lot of

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,239
assumptions about who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as a</font>

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,820
person like what language are familiar

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,798
with whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you can see or hear</font>

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,259
clearly if it's easy for you to type or

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,180
click all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little squares or even</font>

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,310
stuff like where you grew up and how

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,000
that affects your idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what counts as</font>

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,790
a house or what a storefront might be so

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,810
there are a lot of reasons why a capture

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,280
that seems straightforward might

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,130
actually be pretty difficult for someone

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,750
so at cloud player we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them</font>

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,449
only as a last<font color="#CCCCCC"> resort but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am I even</font>

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,880
talking about let's take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> step back for</font>

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,130
a minute and answer a question that some

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,780
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers from from like big</font>

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,950
obvious threats like DDoS attacks but

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,390
also from smaller things like web

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:06,689
scraping or comment spam and we do this

41
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,300
by inspecting signals that we extract

42
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,730
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request that users send through</font>

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,930
us looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things like what resource</font>

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,280
they're requesting

45
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,370
or what browser they're using what

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,230
country they're from to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,750
determination about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font>

48
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,608
is a like a real human using website who

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,930
we should obviously let through or if

50
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:26,400
it's some kind of bot that's attacking

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,689
one of our customers which we should

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,549
obviously restrict and generally we

53
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,260
don't have a problem with this we can

54
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:35,760
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these traits of requests</font>

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,420
and make our decision pretty easily but

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,969
in one particularly notable case we have

57
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,328
almost none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the signals that we</font>

58
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:49,560
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate on to to go on and that</font>

59
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:52,290
is a tor browser and tor browser in

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,629
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sending all of its users</font>

61
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,010
traffic through tor also takes a lot of

62
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,560
additional security measures to protect

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,689
the anonymity of its<font color="#E5E5E5"> users which means</font>

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would normally</font>

65
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:07,349
look at are either deliberately obscured

66
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,519
or outright denied to us so when we

67
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,200
still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

68
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,150
requests that are coming from tor

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,638
browser where everyone looks pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same and is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming over tour we have</font>

71
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,919
to fall back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot broader and less</font>

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,799
precise sorts of signals and in the case

73
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,940
of tor browser the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that matters</font>

74
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,010
is IP reputation and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,840
tor browser what I mean here really is

76
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,489
the IP reputation of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> touareg that</font>

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,479
relays and as you can imagine they're

78
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:42,419
not great it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly because enough</font>

79
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,699
attackers do use tor that are automated

80
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,310
systems that watch for attacks and then

81
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,359
like down rate the VIP is that we see

82
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,579
them coming from automatically assign

83

bad rating to most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> touareg that</font>

relays most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and when we have</font>

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">only see that like oh hey this request</font>

87
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,328
is coming from one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sketchy IPS</font>

88
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,638
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that that traffic</font>

89
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:12,530
might be a malicious and we serve a

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">CAPTCHA to try and disambiguate</font>

91
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:19,139
unfortunately this has side effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

92
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:21,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that we're really here to deal</font>

93
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,830
with today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that tor users end up</font>

94
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,779
getting a lot of Claude slow CAPTCHAs

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,370
because we sit in front of so many

96
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,990
different websites that it

97
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,120
actually pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to imagine someone</font>

98
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,639

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,770
CAPTCHA of ours for not just every

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,050
website they visit in a given day but

101
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,380
also possibly several times over again

102
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,060
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same site and it adds up to you</font>

103
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,840
know easily dozens and dozens of the

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:51,290
street sign things every day and let me

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,289
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tor users love us for this</font>

106
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,698
those those stickers are so popular it

107
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:03,639
took me four days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of CCC to find any but</font>

129
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,440
actually addressed the core issue which

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,990
is that not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,909
solve a CAPTCHA at all ever but that you

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,169
some sort of portable proof of

humaneness that a user of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor browser</font>

137
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,508
can carry around with them and use to

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,520
bypass the the CAPTCHA challenges

139
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,580
without d anonymizing themselves and

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,250
without compromising the security of the

141
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,310
quad flower edge so we're having to meet

142

a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> union set of security</font>

guarantees we make to our customers and

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,479

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like almost a year and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a half</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">now and the crypto team at cloudflare</font>

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,600
knew that we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

151
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,409
about this but we couldn't figure out

152
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,830
what until about a year ago when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we read</font>

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:06,169
a blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post in which Yun suggested that</font>

154
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,060
you could probably rate limit accounts

155
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,719
and an anonymous manner using blind

156
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,820
signatures which by the way is why you

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,100
should i'll be blogging your obvious

158
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,580

<font color="#CCCCCC">of this but when we read this post we</font>

161
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:28,130
build something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and what it's</font>

for the tor browser and a signing

then along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submit a</font>

we can do this without compromising

248
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:35,339
reasonably good answers about the main

249
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,810
problem with that is that any policy

250
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,630
that you want bounds of these tokens

251
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,670
needs to be bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the public key</font>

that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign them so if we want</font>

subset of customers or anything like

256
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,820
that we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with key</font>

257
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,160
management and as you may have heard

258
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,320
earlier we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have like a lot of</font>

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,350

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,779
RSA key that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly think of a</font>

263
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,769
use for so something that doesn't have

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this expectation of policy as key</font>

265
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:13,860
management would be much better

266
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:15,870
operationally for us it would be

267
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,240
possible to add language selection to

268
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,579
some of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do who is look up</font>

some various<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and they usually end</font>

270
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,880

273
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,180
problem for me anyway so for that you'd

knowing as much as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their</font>

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,809
ahead and done something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

289
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,219
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really don't want anonymous users</font>

290
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can already make life harder for</font>

291
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,610
them but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't done that it</font>

292
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,559
probably means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't care and</font>

293
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">we shouldn't be making it harder by</font>

294
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:34,170
default I was wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of</font>

295
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:38,160
attacks are you trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent from</font>

296
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:40,889
tor users that you will actually still

297
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,990
prevent using this system because it

298
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P dos attacks right the door is</font>

299
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:49,800
not suitable for details attacks yeah so

300
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:53,670
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an interesting answer</font>

301
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,819
that I've got for this the type of when

302
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,860
you actually look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of traffic</font>

303
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,339
that we see coming over tour that our

304
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,160
customers don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive it's not</font>

305
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,720
like by volume it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not like what</font>

306
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,589
you would think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like exploits or</font>

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,620
lead Russian hackers it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

308
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:16,290
comment spam and like high bandwidth web

309
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,639
scraping that just has no concept of

310
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,439
rate limiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will take down your</font>

311
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,050
site without thinking about it and those

312
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:24,360
sorts of things do come over tour and

313
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,660
then there's this long tail of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weirdness</font>

314
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,629
like sequel map literally has a dash

315
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,949
dash tour flag that will just rattle of

316
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:34,679
your traffic through tour while you're

317
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:37,769
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do sequel injection attacks so</font>

318
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,089
it's stuff like that I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't</font>

319
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:40,889
aware of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud player was in the</font>

320
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,350
business of scrubbing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content of the</font>

321
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,540
customers that they receive as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I'm</font>

322
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,000
sorry can you repeat I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of</font>

323
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,349
the club

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,030
so it's also in the business of

325
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:57,330
scrubbing the content that their

326
00:14:49,030 --> 00:15:01,780
customers receive content not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

327
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:04,630
the request yes so basically we don't we

328
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,030
don't check for content so much as like

329
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:10,320
form that indicates it's coming from a

330
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,319
Russian botnet or something like that

331
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,880
yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what I'm talking about</font>

332
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a laugh we have a web so early on</font>

333
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,500
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was all like I guess this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

334
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,500
laughs this time last year maybe even

335
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,170
your banoffee of some time in catania

336
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,440
beer before I think you guys published

337
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:36,130
them graphs about which about sort of

338
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,110
sort of the rate at which the tour exits

339
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,850
were being blocked or whatever and of

340
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,980
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't know anything about</font>

341
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,690
where Eva didn't publish sort of the

342
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,380
methodology behind them and things like

343
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,170
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there was when I just sort of</font>

344
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,939
guessing the methodology and backing out

345
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,760
doing some little<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-of-the-envelope</font>

346
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,100
computations it looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you guys</font>

347
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,660
fell it looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you guys were seeing</font>

348
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,839
too bad tour circuits on average sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

349
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,510
continuously so it seemed a bit to me

350
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,089
like the actual culprit there were

351
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:16,380
actually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very many culprits behind</font>

352
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:19,870
this literally two on<font color="#E5E5E5"> average so</font>

353
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:26,550
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really have no idea</font>

354
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that perhaps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

355
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">something so I think those graphs were</font>

356
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,630
generous early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we the ones who've</font>

357
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:38,350
seen on these lives have used a

358
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:41,589
different methodology but more

359
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevantly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that even if it's</font>

360
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,690
just to an average at any time with the

361
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,750
nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour is that we have no way of</font>

362
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,760
identifying them so again if we deploy

363
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:56,580
countermeasures against those we end up

364
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,580
hitting users<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dope</font>

365
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,210
what I meant what I meant by that is

366
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:05,260
there might have been and did you guys

367
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,030
try for example rotating very quickly so

368
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,129
for example the circuit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes so</font>

369
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,250
it there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like rotating very</font>

370
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:15,460
do we doing the detection and whatever

371
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,650
metrics you're doing for detection using

372
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,810
having very fast version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you</font>

373
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,010
can't do that because you have it has to

374
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,950
run over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long period of time right</font>

375
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay nevermind is it gonna be quick yes</font>

376
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:29,830
excellent good work this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

377
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,540
innovative thank you one of the bits of

378
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,010
trying to be anonymous as I understand

379
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,240
it is looking like everybody else is

380
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:40,210
using tor and so if other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

381
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,740
want to do something similar but you

382
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,620
know a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different take your</font>

383
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,290
open source code and do the facebook

384
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,760
challenge bypass specification or even

385
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,820
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV ends might imagine approaching</font>

386
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,330
something like this it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

387
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a bit or so of the anonymization /</font>

388
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,139
plug-in like this that becomes popular

389
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,610
in the world and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for those</font>

390
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,350
who've installed it of course but for

391
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,030
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to install</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it then</font>

392
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,320
they stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> out was being weird in that</font>

393
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">way so to be safe and to really meet</font>

394
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,860
that anonymous ation goal maybe I'm

395
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,879
missing something there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody can</font>

396
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,929
use the one that you've got it so

397
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,120
there's one plug in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get it</font>

398
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">upstream this tour and you're good if so</font>

399
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,810
were you pursuing that pull request

400
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,240
welcome the so short answer yes longer

401
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:29,139
answer is this is in no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way cloudflare</font>

402
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,640
specific it's the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in and</font>

403
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,170
the tags on websites and stuff are

404
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,020
architected present you with a list of

405
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,210
public keys and if you and if you have

406
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,970
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those pinned in your plug-in or</font>

407
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,430
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them even that's what decides</font>

408
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,020
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests for tokens that you</font>

respond to<font color="#CCCCCC"> but which keys you have</font>

410
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,570
panned is detectable so you still<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

411
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,160
bit parky to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend so i guess that Thun</font>

412
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,889
had to make this safe there has to be

413
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,380
one master key and one entity has to

414
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:01,930
hold it I mean you know who I<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose I</font>

415
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,050
who do you propose fuck you later<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

416
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let me take the rest mom</font>

417
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,669
Oh take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off on thank you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>
