1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
okay so memories for your eyes only and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,350
you will see some of the questions in

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous talk actually applies to my</font>

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,750
talk apply to my talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so snapchat</font>

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an app that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allows allow people</font>

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,890
allows people to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font>

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">multimedia communication chatting</font>

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,640
sending video clips young<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:33,950
typically people who are younger than

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:38,579
their parents are typical users and and

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:43,050
recently besides the app the<font color="#E5E5E5"> external</font>

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,250
camera in a form of glasses that you

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,129
visibly see the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a picture</font>

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:54,120
was added<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so adding an external</font>

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:57,449
device and think that are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> deter</font>

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">external that a wearable present some</font>

17
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,968
problems and one problem is that when

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,600
you live when you want to display what

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,390
you film in your camera video clip you

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,470
need to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a display and then you</font>

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,700
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the glasses to to mobile and unique</font>

22
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,970
storage and and you may use different

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,790
devices to do display so you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,179
essentially cloud cloud storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can</font>

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,909
store your your snaps your your video

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,829
clips and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you store them so you remember</font>

27
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,619
them it becomes part of your memories

28
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:45,329
and this is this is memories and so I

29
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,060
will cover in this talk the security

30
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,520
aspects of memories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this cloud</font>

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:59,149
storage and which was released in in

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,699
June last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year sorry D last year yes and</font>

33
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,549
and essentially it's a cloud self

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,970
storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I served my own mem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I</font>

35
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">saved my own memories with security</font>

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,920
against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the servers and the</font>

37
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,760
engineers of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company actually</font>

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,450
getting it so so snapchat has a chat

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,200
part a camera part which typically which

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:29,250
people use and snapped part which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">video with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the video part and the</font>

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,810
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> till memories was introduced the</font>

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:40,530
typical use of it was sending snaps from

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,700
sender to receiver so you you upload a

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,640
snap you you send it two to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,310
friends it's a social<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and then</font>

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,920
the recipient<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other side get a</font>

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:58,470
notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can download this</font>

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:02,359
this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip and and then download it</font>

50
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:06,359
and view it and then it disappears

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:10,500
disappears immediately on the from the

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,980
user device and disappears also after

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,890
some time also<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the storage center</font>

54
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,970
storage so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories and it was a</font>

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:26,309
newer snapchat offering one can keep own

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:28,170
snaps as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said and so the question is</font>

57
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,750
if I keep it on the cloud why should I

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,690
give my content to to the cloud it's

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,730
against the philosophy and it's against

60
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,099
the privacy and you don't want every

61
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,899
engineer in charge of this storage

62
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:45,030
having access to my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories okay so</font>

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,659
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea and so we need to</font>

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,870
design<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsystem and we needed to design</font>

65
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,380
it knowing that extensions are coming we

66
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,870
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that the extension</font>

67
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,820
going to be an external glass at some

68
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,640
point then we learned that we had to

69
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,530
work on the security of the of this

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:10,630
glass this class is<font color="#CCCCCC"> called spectacles</font>

71
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:13,330
and and we need to to account for these

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,549
so the development has to be agile for

73
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:20,890
future extensions and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit</font>

74
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:24,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the existing cloud relationship so this</font>

75
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,969
by the way how memories look you you

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:31,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at your snaps or your stories or</font>

77
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,240
your your camera roll and so on and

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,290
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this section that</font>

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,840
that is called my eyes only<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the</font>

80
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,620
user side you have to eat you to heat a

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,460
pin or password and only then the memory

82
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,550
show up on on on your device so it is it

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,950
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like being protected and the users</font>

84
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,710
know that if they lose the pin they lose

85
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:00,909
the memories I mean just memories and

86
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:06,250
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose their memories yes I don't</font>

87
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:10,830
remember 40 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it was</font>

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:13,210
introduced but what was desired from

89
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,490
analyzing it from a security point of

90
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,409
view so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user is mobile he can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

91
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">from any device people use different</font>

92
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:24,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login to the aid they are to</font>

93
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,530
their own account the content should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

94
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,750
made accessible to the user only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,619
content is not viewable by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,570
servers and even all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers collude</font>

97
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,520
you still want this pin or password

98
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,560
protection and which serves two things

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:48,969
by the way it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> serves if somebody</font>

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:52,350
take my my my device<font color="#CCCCCC"> its and I didn't</font>

101
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">put my pin yet it's not visible even</font>

102
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:01,449
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 somebody physically holding the</font>

103
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:03,879
device and I mean besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> activating the</font>

104
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,830
there is receipt of off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

105
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:10,330
memories of these memories which is in

106
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,998
my honor only my eyes on and we want

107
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,089
also the flexibility to be able to

108
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:19,300
replace servers if needed so server

109
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:23,919
state should be portable at least

110
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,809
initially and so this implies that the

111
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,219
content should be somewhat encrypted on

112
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:32,499
the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user should be able to</font>

113
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:34,389
reconstruct the keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it moves</font>

114
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:37,479
from device to device and only the user

115
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,719
can actually decrypt so possible

116
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:44,710
solutions the first solution is password

117
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,599
rely entirely on on the on the pin

118
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:52,080
encryption but we know that it's too

119
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:56,680
weak enforce very long password it has

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,210
128-bit entropy good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it third</font>

121
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,149
possibility is that the password

122
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:05,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">increase strong key on the local device</font>

123
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:09,719
but you know this doesn't work if the

124
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:16,628
user move between devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> Norma bility</font>

125
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:19,959
we can attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devise to secure</font>

126
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:25,330
hardware module on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on on the cloud</font>

127
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:27,909
but you know this will mean that no not

128
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:34,240
easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change servers it may work for</font>

129
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple but doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work for us so so</font>

130
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:43,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">given this this kind of constraints the</font>

131
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,758
engineers look at it and say oh it looks

132
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">impossible okay what does it mean so it</font>

133
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a principle what does it mean for a</font>

134
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:52,389
cryptographer and software engineer says

135
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:57,089
it's impossible actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpret it as</font>

136
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:59,439
cryptographically interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

137
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:01,810
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to break something</font>

138
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,419
in the setting that makes it impossible

139
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,240
so quick the design of actual

140
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,120
engineering problem in the real world is

141
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,710
also in also involves breaking you don't

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,230
break the cryptography but you break the

143
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,570
mental state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thinking about the</font>

144
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,890
problem you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the</font>

145
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:25,010
box so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to break the books</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

146
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,849
so we decided we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will introduce trust</font>

147
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,710
domains kind of like new servers will do

148
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,860
some key management and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

149
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,740
multi-party protocol between the servers

and the first idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes to you</font>

151
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,430
when you Dookie management is the kind

of secret sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol in variant</font>

minute forget to the sea to the the the

156
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:05,449
typical thing that people usually

157
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,880
criticize theoretical papers you know

158
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,470
you do secretary and who tells you that

159
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers don't talk to each other</font>

forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

161
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:20,830
of it we can build systems some things

162
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:23,300
are easy to criticize on a paper then

163
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,760
when you really build system and take

164
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,479
care of making sure that your assumption

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,090
will hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you look at it as</font>

which is an extension of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pake so you can</font>

you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you know this this</font>

173
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,800

174
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:02,030
typically in cryptography employing

employing a given in crypto engineering

176
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,959
you should take a if you take the

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice very nice intellectually</font>

187
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,110
system like now there is a tendency of

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,350
cryptographers to work for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

190
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,710
into the encryption if you know the

complexity of access control in real

192
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,680
system and how they more over the

193
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,480
lifetime of the system you may wonder if

194
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,849
it's really applicable and when it's

195
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be applicable maybe in rare</font>

196
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,210
cases but this is just one example and

197
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick on anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

198
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:08,170
worked on this problem too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there</font>

199
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a back there we cannot we don't want</font>

200
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,900
to use the existing one because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

201
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,430
the system already exists this is an

202
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,530
incremental step some actions are

203
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,569
already performed in the system take

204
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,100
advantage of it just repeating the

205
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,710
crypto for the sake of repeating the

206
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,380
crib so is clumsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance-wise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it</font>

207
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,600
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not good and you know</font>

208
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,010
system needs flexibility of design and

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,660
to account for modularity and increment

210
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ality that comes with the development</font>

211
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,920
versus so what what we decided to do is

212
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:49,930
to employ our own solution which will

213
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,180
use the metric cryptography they're

214
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,699
already in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system authentication</font>

215
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,750
flows like user authentication and in

216
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,090
servers have their own public key for

217
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,160
signing and there is a certificate

218
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,830
pinning in the system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can take</font>

219
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these so we built on</font>

220
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:13,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists existing components so what</font>

221
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,410
we have so what we deployed so we we

222
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,940
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a general design</font>

223
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,850
we have the first deployment so the

224
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,500
first deployment is essentially a

225
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:28,040
three-party<font color="#CCCCCC"> design with with two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

226
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:30,620
and a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course we have</font>

227
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,420
numerous extensions in mind for the

228
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,480
lifetime<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and the emerging</font>

229
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,759
needs and the hardening of security and

230
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,519
so on it's a principle you have to be

231
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,910
clairvoyant about what's coming in the

232
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">system especially when it's not like the</font>

233
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,969
function<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the primary function of</font>

234
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,410
the system which<font color="#E5E5E5"> security usually is not</font>

235
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,819
so we'll have flexible key management

236
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,800
the snaps the videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font>

237
00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:02,420
encrypted with a snap key and there's

238
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,519
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a master key that is going</font>

239
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,469
to encrypt all the keys and then we are

240
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to do to run the protocols on this</font>

241
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:12,740
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> master key this is the typical</font>

242
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:14,420
way to to compress information or

243
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,000
compress the important information the

244
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,849

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,939
clips of<font color="#CCCCCC"> principal and we will share and</font>

246
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,180
reconstruct the master key only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:30,139
master<font color="#E5E5E5"> key will be chosen at the user</font>

248
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:32,959
device and all the operations will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

249
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:37,639
on that master key so the general

250
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure we employ two layers</font>

251
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,750
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer and the layering is</font>

252
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,500
natural because authentication aspects

253
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist and then we will do the master key</font>

254
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,860
sharing and recover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the secret sharing</font>

255
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:58,269
like operation so secret sharing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:03,019
method<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know to to to distribute</font>

257
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:05,269
secret among different parties it's

258
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,939
rarely used commercially there are uses

259
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,309
in military<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications everybody know</font>

00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in a nuclear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submarine it's not one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on on only in our secretary okay so</font>

268
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,300
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> use these three out of three</font>

269
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:42,959
version and the embedding protocols in

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,329
the environment the memories protocol

271
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the memories protocol is the user you</font>

272
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:57,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">log seen produces content and then</font>

273
00:14:51,810 --> 00:15:00,359
deposit it and it can deposit also in

274
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:06,020
the my eyes only in the secure section

275
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,490
of the storage and then comes the

276
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,930
retrieval which you lobs in and then

277
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,100
retreats the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories okay simple so</font>

278
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,410
there are sessions that you load

279
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:21,510
memories and their sessions that you

280
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,490
recall your memories that's right like

281
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:28,050
in real life it's real life quit so here

282
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:34,410
is our memories any you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol</font>

283
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:37,079
wise depicted it's similar to to to the

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,660
previous the sender and receiver

285
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,750
protocol but here the same user is the

286
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,579
sender and the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a</font>

287
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,800
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more a synchronous in some</font>

288
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:51,990
sense notify the server puts the

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,329
memories<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we're sure v2 to</font>

290
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,850
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and now to the protocol</font>

291
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,350
this is the more technical part and the

292
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:07,620
possible i call it to give and take

293
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:10,620
protocol the user creating essentially

294
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,470
gives the key to the servers and then

295
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,760
then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wants to read the memories</font>

296
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and an end and opened my eyes only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> snaps</font>

297
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,710
it retrieves it calls backs it takes

298
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,910
back the keys from the key from the

299
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,680
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then the user will also</font>

300
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,290
have a part that it contributes to

301
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,530
protect against collusion of the servers

302
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,660
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about if you lose the</font>

305
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:47,279
ok so the protocol the skeleton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

key generation and sharing the gift part

308
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,410
so the user authenticate to the server

312
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,449
essentially signing that you know this

314
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:14,490
it gets from the server high entropy

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:25,829
the server remembers this n is part of

into his account and authenticate itself

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:54,289
and based on this authentication gets

from the main server the nonce<font color="#CCCCCC"> N and</font>

again shortly the session certificate

the response is sent by the server and

the response is sent to the key server

so the key server can

together with the session certificate

and they respond and the key server

<font color="#CCCCCC">check the signature check the respond is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right response to the challenge and if</font>

379
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:46,250
so it sends the token t1 which is the

really run it this way and and and

something to take into account

00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to recap that you know often you see</font>

442
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,090
multi-server based security and people

443
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,000
believe its theoretical but with the

444
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,240
right we score or analysis and trust

445
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,470
model and system understanding and

446
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,580
hardening it can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a</font>

447
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:54,380
reward security and we implemented it in

448
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,060
this case so this is to not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

449
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:02,300
forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean secret sharing does not</font>

450
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,300
exist only to to write the papers about

451
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,590
ok so this building on the system's

452
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,210
flowed it's very important the system

453
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:13,620
exists and you build them layer by layer

454
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:17,540
by layer and trust variations on cloud

455
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,939
server is possible and the principle is

456
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:25,340
you know in practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus theory so</font>

457
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,990
the principle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was applied</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a</font>

458
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,990
bit of sophistication which gives you a

459
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:33,660
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of miles so we are they at the the</font>

460
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:39,240
era where politically correct

461
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:40,710
correctness is claimed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be dead but I</font>

462
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,720
advocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this principle is</font>

463
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:48,170
important and I call it industrially

464
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,170
correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>

465
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,379
yeah thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> monkey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we have signs</font>

466
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,750
for one question there's a quick

467
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,220
question yeah yeah I'm interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

468
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,660
much key stretching you're able to do if

469
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,610
I understand the design correctly the

470
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,440
KDF step takes place on the user device

471
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,760
when we did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to this in</font>

472
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox accounts a couple years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we</font>

473
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">felt very constrained by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low power</font>

474
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,840
devices on that side can you tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

475
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">scrappy crap PP k DF yeah of course this</font>

476
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,990
was the problem there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an array of</font>

477
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:22,080
all the possible devices and and we

478
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:24,540
settled on on the one that we could

479
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,550
support and want it to support there was

480
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers that are</font>

481
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,740
exactly for that and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this was</font>

482
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,930
totally checked I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as I say the</font>

483
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning this talk does not cover all</font>

484
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,730
the aspects of the design here there are

485
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,910
many many other layers thank you thank

486
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

487
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:48,720
