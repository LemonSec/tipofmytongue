1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,330
okay thanks i'll talk about what NIST is

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:13,530
doing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possible deployment of</font>

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,859
quantum computers in the next couple

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,060
decades okay so the problem is that

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,189
large quantum computers they would break

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,650
most of our public key crypto that

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:31,109
includes our say diffie-hellman is it's

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,600
a curb crypto symmetric crypto would not

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,000
be affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surprising the number</font>

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,030
of meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go where people tell me</font>

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,379
that you know AES has gone after<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum</font>

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:51,809
computers that's not the case but we

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:54,059
will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make keys longer full</font>

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:00,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition to alternatives takes a long</font>

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:03,599
time judging from the history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,689
things we could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily claim about 20</font>

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I suspect that there may be a</font>

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,689
greater sense of their urgency with

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,640
respect to the advent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quantum</font>

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:23,639
computing so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking maybe about 10</font>

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:31,159
years or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so the time to worry about</font>

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:33,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is is now okay this is doesn't the</font>

23
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">see enough attention from my point of</font>

24
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,570
view there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term privacy and</font>

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,189
security implications which affect us

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,048
now from the privacy perspective there

27
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">are things that are being stored to now</font>

28
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,020
by agencies and possibly industry which

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,409
will later which can't be open now but

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,280
will be maybe open the if computer

31
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,969
quantum computers are built<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and now</font>

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,829
you have kids or grandchildren their<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNA</font>

33
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:10,679
profiles may be stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ways there may</font>

34
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,019
be opened in the future so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

35
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,460
a severe

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,020
a threat that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're facing now not not</font>

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,540
when computers are built the

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">contributors are built but now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,060
supports it and something similar with

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:29,480
respect to security implications I think

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:33,130
if quantum computers are built<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,899
are deployed we will see many years

43
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,210
possibly decades during which we are

44
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,390
going to be discovering all kinds of

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:46,400
things being protected by pre quantum

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:51,950

<font color="#CCCCCC">our applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a very</font>

48
00:02:51,950 --> 00:03:03,250
difficult task<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this has a post</font>

49
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,250
quantum cryptography project like that

50
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's been going on for about five years</font>

51
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,570
now our goal is to monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress in</font>

52
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:16,670
quantum computers and quantum algorithms

53
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:20,810
to find and standardize quantum

54
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:24,440
persistent alternatives for public key

55
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:30,010
encryption key agreement and digital

56
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,020
signatures and to ensure the

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,959
transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:46,310

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:05,660

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,510
sounding board and eventually eventually

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,579
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision but</font>

69
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,899
hopefully the decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> will really be</font>

made by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:37,130
we may standardized at several give a

75
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,289
relation criteria when we have a

76
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,110
competition the relation criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font>

77
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,060
to be written in stone because later if

<font color="#E5E5E5">we start changing things later in the</font>

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,100
that this is not written in stone we

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,570
know too little about quantum computers

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,729
right now we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> tolu about the</font>

complexity actual complexity of of

the next seven years<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so criteria</font>

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,659
hopefully will evolve and it will

89
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,389
reflect our gaining knowledge of the

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:30,169
situation there's a call for proposals

that's the way we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and this</font>

about what what techniques look the best

112
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:14,469
give you a rough listing of what we see

113
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:17,679
out there now so for signatures we see

114
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:22,750
hash based signatures code based lattice

115
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:25,599
based and multivariate based signatures

116

the dot dot dot means that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

117
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:34,300
to be helped to this being an exhaustive

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,580
list in any of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for public key</font>

119
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,210
encryption we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> see lattice base code</font>

120
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:44,650
based multivariate there are others

121
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:52,180
braid groups and things like that for

122
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:54,878
key agreement what one can decide that

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,639
key agreement is not a real topic that

124
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:02,650
was because once you solve TKE you have

125
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:08,110
key agreement no we chose not to we want

126
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call it a separate problem but you</font>

127
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,550
know it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be solved used solving the</font>

128
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,529
public key encryption problem but there

129
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,520
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lattice base and a sergeant Lee bass</font>

130
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:22,620
and other types of dedicated curry

131
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,620

132
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:31,520
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to what will change what</font>

133
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:35,029
would in terms of speed and sizes of

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,409
things Steve looks good that's

135
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:44,570
surprising to me anyhow some of these

136
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:46,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems work blindingly fast key sizes</font>

not so good they<font color="#CCCCCC"> may increase</font>

138
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:55,370
significantly some signature sizes look

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,680
big not terribly vague that they they

140
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:04,550
look big<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have to collectively</font>

141
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:07,910
decide that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or not there may be a</font>

142
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:14,180
significant increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cipher text size</font>

143
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:17,569
for short plain text I really have no

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea how you you know how industry feels</font>

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:29,589
do to applications we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do need to</font>

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a an impact assessment by industry</font>

148
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:36,199
especially industry but you know also

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">but by the community at large and we</font>

150
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:42,050
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that impact assessment now</font>

151
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:46,730
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because once once</font>

152
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,579
the they're very few candidates left

153
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,610
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quick clear come you know</font>

154
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:54,949
two or three clear candidates are likely

155
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:59,209
to win this thing to end up being the

156
00:09:54,949 --> 00:10:02,420
standard then the impact assessments get

157
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:08,619
the all muddled by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that people</font>

158
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:12,229
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be advancing their their favorite</font>

159
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,220
candidates if we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now that</font>

160
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,220
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful</font>

161
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:28,190
what's a public discussion there's this

162
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,540
ongoing discussion if you've seen the

163
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:36,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PUC form you'll see that there's in</font>

164
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:41,810
this rather strident disagreement about

165
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:54,500
this measure of security that that's in

166
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:58,160
the couple proposals the my position

167
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:03,350
about this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so in this in this</font>

168
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,060
security levels to really answer the the

169
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,040
specific wording of the call for

170
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:12,290
proposals you it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,560
decide how many quantum gates that are

172
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,279
required to break your candidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on</font>

173
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,939
the other hand some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us it would be</font>

174
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:26,899
sorry I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no candidate should</font>

175
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,870
have to be no proposer should have to be

176
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:32,750
a expert on quantum<font color="#CCCCCC"> computation in order</font>

177
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,750
to put it in a submission so if you have

178
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:41,269
any problems with what you know putting

179
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">a number to this to this number of</font>

181
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:58,310
contact the forum this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> us open as as</font>

182
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:03,709
it can be this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process okay so</font>

183
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:08,719
contact us<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll sort it out are</font>

184
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:12,680
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the arm of the NSA</font>

185
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,110
I guess I can't blame the community I

186
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,699
have another project which is dear to my

187
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,220
heart which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NIST randomness</font>

188
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:22,160
beacons and I and sometimes I google

189
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,170
that beak analysis the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST NSA beacon</font>

190
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,160
and there's pictures of me with like

191
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,160
horns and things

192
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:36,649
so this committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this pqc project as</font>

193
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:38,689
a committee of eight people there's a

194
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,639
report out that spelled out our

195
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:44,118
understanding of this about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight months</font>

196
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,879
ago or so that report contains the names

197
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:48,919
of seven of the eight current members of

198
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,659
this team there's no secrecy there

199
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,209
there's just eight members of Miss right

200
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:58,639
now we sit at the table the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> has no</font>

201
00:12:53,209 --> 00:13:01,238
no seat at that table<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay however you</font>

202
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:07,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">know times are a little scary right now</font>

203
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:11,929
so watch us keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

204
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:19,069
we need that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> our that you protect</font>

205
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:21,108
us by demanding our transparency<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

206
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:25,959
another topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making the</font>

207
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:30,879
rounds is demands that future standards

208
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,878
make bad implementations harder I

209
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:38,359
suspect this would be very hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in</font>

210
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:40,009
the abstract<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us miss to agree that</font>

211
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:44,720
we're going to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the standards</font>

212
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:48,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this requirement that you know if you if</font>

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:52,220
you say develop a<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES to it we'll have</font>

214

all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to check for possible</font>

215
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,739
by implementations I think I think

216
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,749
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to fly I may be</font>

217
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:02,629
wrong so if you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly about that</font>

218
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:05,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">place art with respect to the candidates</font>

we're really going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this standard I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this particular algorithm and you have a</font>

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

230
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:41,889
a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> standardise it to make it more</font>

231
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:44,350
resilient to too bad implementations and

232
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:46,569
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the time to argue</font>

233
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,350
for those things if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to argue for</font>

234
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:55,839
them as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general rule for standards I</font>

235
00:14:50,350 --> 00:15:01,600
think that's not going to fly how am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

236
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:05,319
doing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh okay the timeline formal</font>

237
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:11,009
call is out<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 30 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the deadline</font>

238
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:16,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the submissions will have during</font>

239
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:18,819
2018 will have a workshop and then that

240
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,709
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed by three to five years</font>

241
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:26,349
of analysis will report the findings and

242
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:29,199
wanted one two workshops during this

243
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:35,109
phase and hopefully two years after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

244
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:40,209
we'll have the standard sweaty so so

245
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:46,649
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is seven years this process may</font>

246
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:46,649
take a good seven years from now thank

247
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to ask in the in the call there</font>

248
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,080
was no liquid signature there was no

249
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,760
sophistication on whether you're looking

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:09,760
for state list of scheduled signatures

251
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:12,610
any opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that I think we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

252
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:18,390
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take both candidates for</font>

253
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:20,890
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether stateful have this the</font>

254
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:27,550
private key size problem which is

255
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:29,680
gigantic so if there are advantages if

256
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,160
people can argue that for advantages

257
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,079
that make us wanting to do that despite

258
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that then we'll definitely consider them</font>

259
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:44,140
so both are in play<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I was my</font>

260
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,630
understanding that this has publicly

261
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,520
said that they were not interested in

262
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,850
hash these signatures you are

263
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:57,870
contradicting that yes I don't know what

264
00:16:51,850 --> 00:17:00,070
said that I was wondering you mentioned

265
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,170
industry impact assessments so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

266
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering if any federal agencies doing</font>

267
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:10,060
their own impact assessment that would

268
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:11,410
serve as a model for that whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

269
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,359
were the federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> government would be</font>

270
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,690
interested in stimulating any industry

271
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,520
activity around there oh I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

272
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,660
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second part of that</font>

273
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:28,860
questions above my pay grade I can

274
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:32,140
certainly pass that that suggestion on

275
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,830
with respect to what is being done by a

276
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,830
federal agency other that the NSA which

277
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:42,040
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us I wouldn't trust</font>

278
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,020
the assessment that any of us any of

279
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">these agencies including this can do it</font>

280
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,600
I think it is beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> our capabilities</font>

281
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,220
thank you anyway yeah actually I also

282
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,320
wanted to clarify you said that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

283
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,320
panel of eight people yep seven which

284
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,879
are public and one of which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

285
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just hired him that's why he's not</font>

286
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,429
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the everybody's everybody's name is</font>

287
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,659
public the eighth person was

288
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:09,389
after this this report was published so

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,320
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who sit</font>

291
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:18,929
at this table is put out somewhere that

292
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was okay you mentioned making that</font>

293
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,019
implementations harder and perhaps

294
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:23,879
delaying that consideration alone

295
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,929
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way of putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

296
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:27,539
that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make correct</font>

297
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,519
implementations easier and certainly

298
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,649
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps be prioritized early</font>

299
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,169
hood instead of trying to place

300
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:36,508
landmines for bad implementations we're

301
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:37,980
certainly avoid putting in complexities

302
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,919
that make good implementations less

303
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,769
likely not perhaps in a good

304
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,350
consideration earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that should be</font>

305
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:50,639
in the minds of all everybody who plans

306
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:56,360
to submit this I yes let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font>

307
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:56,360
a suggestion to your submissions great
