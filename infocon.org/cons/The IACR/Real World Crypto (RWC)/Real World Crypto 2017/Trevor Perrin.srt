00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Kenny good afternoon everyone</font>

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,580
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being here on the beautiful</font>

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,719
beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York day so i'm trevor</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,090
curran<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to be talking with you</font>

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,889
this session about the classical use

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,670
case of cryptography which is of course

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,250
the encryption of text messages this is

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,220
where choreography started thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,170
years ago it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing it did for</font>

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,919
most of its history and it remains a

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,019
challenging use case even<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and an</font>

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,820
important use case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,920
giving a sort of sweeping overview of

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,170
the history and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evolution of message</font>

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,500
encryption systems and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,059
got to where we are today and some kind

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,789
of challenges we have to tackle<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,919
future I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be doing this from a</font>

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple perspectives I'm going to be</font>

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,629
talking about first key management and

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,670
key distribution and then secondly

22
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,460
zooming in and looking a little bit at

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,930
the protocols that these keys are then

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,910
used within so to dive into it and look

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,260
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of key management and</font>

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,179
message encryption systems I think we

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to first say a little bit about</font>

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,780
cryptography so you know if we go back

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,580
in time and say before the 20th century

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,869
cryptography really had not been

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,170
changing all that quickly for the

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">previous four hundred or so years people</font>

33
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,180
would use manual ciphers which tended to

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,610
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> either not very secure or hard to use</font>

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,650
or both<font color="#E5E5E5"> or people would use various</font>

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,420
sources of code books and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,770
were easier to use there were a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,259
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create because someone would</font>

39
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,460
have to compile a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of</font>

40
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,869
substitutions or hundreds of

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,369
substitutions and then maybe reverse

42
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,420
index them and print all this out and

43
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,250
distribute it so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,530
code book is sort of keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time at</font>

45
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,060
this point keys were hard to even create

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,240
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd make one of them you'd give it</font>

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,979
all your diplomats they'd you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font>

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,899
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the same one for years and that</font>

49
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,000
had all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of security problems</font>

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,250
you can imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">because cryptography was not terribly</font>

52
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,159
important at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of time to time</font>

53
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,640
went on with the 20th century we got

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,740
radio and

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arab world wars and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> importance</font>

56
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,920
of cryptography sort of exploded there

57
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,170
was a huge amount of innovation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
research and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the</font>

59
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">Industrial Revolution for cryptography</font>

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,970
so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time of World War two we had</font>

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,430
ciphered machines as sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

62
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,320
workhorses of military crypto there were

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,690
still a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use of manual ciphers and</font>

64
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,060
code books for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lower level or</font>

65
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,280
tactical traffic and then at high levels

66
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,600
of community<font color="#CCCCCC"> herb sent for certain point</font>

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,100
to point communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers use of</font>

68
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,829
one-time pads force a high-level

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,239
diplomatic or military traffic or spies

70
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,280
who don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> psycho</font>

71
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines so at this point there wasn't a</font>

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,270
sort of unified military messaging

73
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,190
system there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

74
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems that you could use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

75
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,109
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the military case was</font>

76
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,850
compartmented and hierarchical anyways

77
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,530
with someone passing messages up and

78
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,570
down the chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> of command so that was</font>

79
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,150
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of okay or at least what</font>

80
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,269
they had the key management underlying

81
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,950
this was was simple someone created keys

82
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,290
and gave them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so there'd be</font>

83
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,060
a center that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice and Bob wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,950
talk the center would have to give each

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,870
of them the same key and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be</font>

86
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to communicate so this was a you</font>

87
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a rigid centrally controlled system</font>

88
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:18,280
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what they had moving on to</font>

89
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,459
the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first decades of</font>

90
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,440
the Cold War cryptography remained a

91
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,450
very you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of secretive and</font>

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,220
military activity but enough has been

93
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Declassified that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of see</font>

94
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,079
the picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's you know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">distraction machines taking over</font>

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,360
becoming electronic use of one-time pads

97
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,100
or code books or other things falling

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
off except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for special use cases and</font>

99
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,290
symmetric at least stream stalkers

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,238
assuming a pretty modern<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

101
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,780
appearance with small keys random nonces

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,130
and strong security models but key

103
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution and key management really</font>

104
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,090
didn't change much in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> period the</font>

105
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">center created keys and and gave them to</font>

106
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,519
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you use one key a day and so on</font>

107
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,579
remained a rigid system that remained a

108
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,019
lot of a big logistical hassle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

109
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,430
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of risks here because</font>

110
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,590
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of opportunity for someone</font>

111
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,870
to copy a key list and sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just</font>

112
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,739
to steal keys and these were very real

113
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,358
threats so you know with the 1980s a lot

114
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,978
of attention shifted in towards ways of

115
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,048
using symmetric keys to protect other

116
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,430
symmetric keys there's not a great

117
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,388
single term for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

118
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">just call it symmetric key</font>

119
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:29,169
infrastructure and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic idea is is</font>

120
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,150
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it's just that every party</font>

121
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,580
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unique key they register it with</font>

122
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,198
the center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at the centre wants</font>

123
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,810
to group users into a group to

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,580
communicate it can just choose a group

125
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,110
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt that group key to each</font>

126
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,969
user's unique key and then send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a</font>

127
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,849
ticket just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an encryption of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the group</font>

128
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,650
key under a unique key so that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

129
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,539
evolved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of radio systems</font>

130
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,310
rose known as over-the-air rekeying it's

131
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,159
a pretty reasonable way to manage sort

132
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,810
of small radio networks and it's how you

133
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:58,719
know you can add users to groups you can

134
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,699
rekey groups and revoke users by giving

135
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:03,490
everyone else new keys and this is still

136
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">how a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know voice radios for</font>

137
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,889
military or public safety systems are

138
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:11,139
managed today but it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

139
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,060
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to a large-scale messaging system</font>

140
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,300
where anyone can send anyone a message

141
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,830
unless we put the kick the KDC online so

142
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,229
Alice can contact it and say hey give me

143

145
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,409
you know the US government built in a

secure phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems also using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">model but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty awkward to have to</font>

148
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,919
reach out and contact an online KDC

149
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,949
every time you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a message or</font>

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,419
have a phone call<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone you know</font>

151
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,430
it's a performance it's a reliability

152
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,318
problem it's just and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

153
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,039
problem if the online KDC gets

154
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,409
compromised so by the 1990s public key

155
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,960
cryptography was mature enough that

156
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:52,449
attention shifted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> using pki and of</font>

157
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,340
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> public key crypto was a you know</font>

158
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:58,000
a revolutionary breakthrough in

159
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,479
cryptography but for message for key

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,940
management the systems were pretty

161
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,560
continuous or there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

162
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,840
similarities to what came before it so

163
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,909
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pki as sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

167
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,250
instead of a symmetric key and then the

00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the center is going to push out</font>

169
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,430
information that lets people communicate

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:24,580
with each other in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the form of</font>

171
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,819
certificates now instead of tickets and

172
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,779
probably revocation information but

173
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:30,820
these certificates are different from

174
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,320
tickets because they're not per each

175
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,670
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users</font>

176
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,880
them a single key<font color="#E5E5E5"> there per each</font>

177
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,680
individual so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki can push out you</font>

know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single sheet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get per user</font>

179
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,570
put them into in a directory and allow

180
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,830
any users to choose to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

181
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,780
now all of a sudden we have a flexible

182
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,180
system anyone can communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

183
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,580
anyone else that's fairly exciting

184
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a big advance and this as this</font>

185
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,599
idea was popularized in the 90s the

186
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,810
internet was taking off people you know

187
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,550
were enthusiastic about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and an</font>

188
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,770
industry strung up around there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sort</font>

189
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,540
of the idea that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> military</font>

190
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,950
applications and<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-use would drive</font>

191
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,390
government use which would drive big

192
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,130
enterprise use which would drive little

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise views everyone would be</font>

194
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,520
deploying PK eyes and you could go

195
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,890
further you could have the certificate

196
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,960
authorities issue certificates to each

197
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,060
other to express how much or what they

198
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,620
trusted each other for and then connect

199
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,530
the whole system into sort of a global

200
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki mesh and you know that anyone would</font>

be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have secure communications</font>

202
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,890
with anyone so that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very exciting</font>

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">vision some people it was a scary vision</font>

to other people the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1990s with errors of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the crypto Wars and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of controversy</font>

206
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,940
around what would happen you know when

207
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,229
when all this stuff was ubiquitous but

208
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,780
as the decade progressive became kind of

209
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">apparent that this was not just an</font>

210
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,559
exciting or scary vision it was a pretty

211
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,650
unrealistic one because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tiki imesh</font>

212
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,510
was just not coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into existence even</font>

213
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we tried other you know variations</font>

214
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,349
of the concept like saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if</font>

215
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,570
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it to a logical extreme say</font>

216
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,720
everyone's can issue certificates into

217
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,599
the directory and follow a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peak pgp like</font>

219
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,280
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things really really took off and</font>

220
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,540
it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a few reasons it's</font>

221
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,340
probably because building a key

222
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,590
management system is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work</font>

223
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,090
interacting with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a user is a lot</font>

224
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of work people are only going to do</font>

225
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,659
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when they're strongly</font>

226
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,219
motivated and the systems they build are

227
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,190
going to be for specific context they're

228
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,270
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy to connect together</font>

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,820
information into global directories

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,429
people are not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to publish</font>

the entire social network into into

00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,598
global directories even if there were

235
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,130
languages that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to fully</font>

236
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,960
describe the world of human trust

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,780
relationships which there aren't really

238
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,540
either so for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons sort of</font>

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,939
expansive vision of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font>

technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of niches a lot of</font>

242
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:55,349
important niches such as the web but

243
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">even in enterprises that deployed PK</font>

244
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,160
eyes it got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more use for things</font>

245
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,699
like single sign-on<font color="#CCCCCC"> than encrypted</font>

246
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,800
messaging so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000s were sort of an</font>

247
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:06,540
era<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of demoralisation and no one</font>

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">really people sort of worked on other</font>

249
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,680
things we tried a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you</font>

250
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,790
know there were some other variations on

251
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,800
the concept like identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

252
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,790
encryption that didn't really you know

253
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,349
transform the situation either then the

254
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,819
current decade I think there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some</font>

255
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,829
movement again for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple reasons kind</font>

256
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:27,719
of combining together I think firstly

257
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,329
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the increased public</font>

258
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,579
awareness of people's vulnerability to

259
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,709
massive data breaches and mass

260
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:38,130
surveillance it gets secondly the

261
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,930
emergence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mobile messaging apps which</font>

262
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,759
are managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by some company and has</font>

263
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,189
acquired you know huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of user</font>

264
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,649
bases and of course bullet point number

265
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,850
two dramatically increases everyone's

266
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:49,139
worried about bullet point number<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

267
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,630
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like well what if these</font>

268
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,880
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> get get breach are they spying on</font>

269
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,680
us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same point bullet number</font>

270
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
two gives us the ability to do something

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,500
about bullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> number one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because these</font>

272
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,300
apps are managed by a company that has

273
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,160
an engineering team that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

274
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,050
pushing out features and competing with

275
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other messaging apps for a</font>

276
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,859
fickle audience who can easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch</font>

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,089
apps so increasingly in the last you

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,010
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of</font>

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,449
these companies look at all the the

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,360
sensitive data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're handling and</font>

281
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:16,439
that's being stored on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks and</font>

282
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,149
you know realizing that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

283
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,399
scary for them it's scary for their user

284
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,529
base and they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just encrypt</font>

285
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,810
it and so you know people like I'm

286
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,459
message and then whatsapp run over to

287
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,310
just default message encryption systems

288
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,040
where you have the endpoints generate

289
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,540
public keys the server tributes those

290
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,019
public keys to other people it's needed

291
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,029
and then the server only sees fekr text

292
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,410
so that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> development advise you</font>

293
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,819
security against the server doing

294
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,699
passive monitoring or retroactive

295
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:46,229
decryption it leads to big open

296
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:48,719
questions such as how do you know the

297
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,310
server really gave you the key honestly

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,220
and it's not doing it active

299
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,510
man-in-the-middle attack and a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

300
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">different approaches are being taken</font>

301
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,529
here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common is something</font>

302
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,379
like what signal is doing we

303
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:04,800
they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one could sort of out of</font>

304
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,110
band<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication to be done so in</font>

305
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,699
signals case you can recomputation has a

306
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,980
safety number which is just a

307
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:13,050
concatenation of public key fingerprints

308
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,939
but users don't know what public key

309
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,829
fingerprints are so they're called

310
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:18,779
safety numbers to be just a single kind

311
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of token of information it's easy to</font>

312
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,730
compare them just by doing a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> QR</font>

313
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,990
code scan and you get a yes or no answer

314
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,220
and you can also convey the safety

315
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,680
number through a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel and</font>

316
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,269
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier by if you you</font>

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,339
know click on it a bunch of ways pop up

318
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,740
to send it through another messaging app

319
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,480
or you know an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email system or whatever</font>

320
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,160
so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> in demand the middle isms</font>

321
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,069
isn't in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of these</font>

322
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,309
things most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

323
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,170
this but some people will do it and if

324
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:48,540
some people do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the system</font>

325
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,439
doesn't know who those people are and it

326
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,240
shouldn't then it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose risk to</font>

327
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:56,550
attacking or man-in-the-middle anyone so

328
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
you know smaller number of people you

00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,639
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> performing these checks you know</font>

330
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,189
you would you'd hope to keep a larger

331
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,649
system honest there's other approaches

332
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:06,809
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most interesting is the</font>

333
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,209
certificate transparency idea which has

334
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:13,889
been adapted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to messaging has the</font>

335
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:16,170
reconyx concept where the server

336
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,540
publishes a mapping of usernames to

337
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,099
public keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob can check and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font>

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's any unexpected mappings in the</font>

339
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,540
public database and the server can also

340
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,279
prove to Alice when it gives her a key

341
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,050
said it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key that was published</font>

342
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,180
and that's an idea that a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

343
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on I hope it you know</font>

344
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,160
goes forward and becomes a reality you

345
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,199
can imagine enterprises deploying

346
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,089
trusted directories as well that people

347
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,008
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> within their employee base</font>

348
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,500
publish their keys into and look up keys

349
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,269
keys from so there's a variety of things

350
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,399
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and if we sort of step back</font>

351
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,129
and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a model I think that</font>

352
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,559
they all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be described as</font>

353
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:53,939
these Alton<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an encrypt than</font>

354
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,490
authenticate model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different</font>

355
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,839
from a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous things that I</font>

356
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,089
was describing which was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

357
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,249
authenticate than encrypt model so

358
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,660
that's a distinction that I think we can

359
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,879
see at two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels in these</font>

360
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,809
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the user</font>

361
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience of new messaging systems</font>

362
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,219
there's a

363
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,689
you know you use them and you get

364
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,550
encryption for free it just happened

365
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,920
it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero cost thing there's</font>

366
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,870
the encryption is there then you can

367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,000
spend extra effort if you want to do the

368
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,160
if you might add extra authentication so

369
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,840
that perspective they're in there an

370
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">encrypted authenticate system that's</font>

371
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">very different from you know a lot of</font>

372
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,030
the other things we talked about

373
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,440
traditionally if you want to do

374
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,170
encryption you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> register with the</font>

375
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,230
center your provisioned with a key or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

376
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,449
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a ticket</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then that</font>

377
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,730
gives you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to then go and do</font>

378
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,900
encryption so there's a just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

379
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:48,310
reversal of that relationship here if

380
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,170
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at how these systems are being</font>

381
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,780
built engineering-wise we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

382
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar thing people are in these</font>

383
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,079
messaging apps building out the

384
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,610
encryption layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> first working out all</font>

385
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,110
the mechanics of distributing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys</font>

386
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,240
handling group and multi-device

387
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,980
communications and so on and then

388
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,510
thinking about how to refine the

389
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,890
authentication experience how to add

390
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,260
out-of-band checks and these kind of

391
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,020
other more complicated systems to them

392
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,400
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very different from how the you</font>

393
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,100
know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to tackle things like</font>

394
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki where the the model was you start</font>

395
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,330
off you build a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki you you know you</font>

396
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,829
choose a certificate authority practice

397
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,780
statements replication and authorities

398
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,280
registration authorities deploy this

399
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,110
whole infrastructure provision everyone

400
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,550
with smart cards and keys and then you

401
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,740
build applications on top of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

402
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,900
the authentication is the baseline

foundation in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the framework these new</font>

404
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,010
systems are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption is the</font>

405
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">foundation that's what we start with</font>

406
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,310
because that's what we know how to do a

407
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit better there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

408
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,430
mechanical problems there we can solve

409
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,079
to figure out how practical it even is

410
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,699
and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on building</font>

411
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,310
these different sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication</font>

mechanisms on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that platform and</font>

413
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,560
so is this a is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better model is</font>

414
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,660
it a worse model I think that you know

415
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,839
it's neither it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> model that</font>

416
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflects the world changing and I think</font>

417
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,260
the sort of authenticate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and crips model</font>

418
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,750
the traditional kind of key management

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,780
model grew up in the 20th century sort

420
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,550
of rooted in a military use case around

421
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,680
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single root of trust if you</font>

422
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,660
if you're in the US Army the US Army

423
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,989
defines your security policy it tells

424
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,760
you how to authenticate from now some

425
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,770
consumer applications if you're a

426
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,830
whatsapp user there's no clear way to

427
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,329
say who's defining your security policy

428
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,370
how you should authenticate that's a

429
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,020
question that probably needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be left</font>

430
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,970
to these many different users and user

431
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,550
communities so there's a difference

432
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,130
there I think the traditional sort of

433
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,650
models emerge out of asymmetric crypto

434
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,780
world where you had to distribute keys

435
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,220
and do authentication before<font color="#E5E5E5"> using them</font>

436
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that simply held</font>

437
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,840
symmetric trip to work and public key

438
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,490
crypto you have no options you can do a

439
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,190
you know forward secure key agreement

440
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,440
and then check afterwards that the keys

441
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">are authentic and these you know the</font>

442
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,050
traditional system sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emerged out</font>

443
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,689
of a world where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're protecting the</font>

444
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,750
radio or rather sort of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

445
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,160
like simple communications mediums there

446
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,650
was no concept that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the communication</font>

447
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,850
medium you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the servers using</font>

448
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,069
might actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you</font>

449
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,780
distribute keys and assist you in

450
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,090
removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them from the trust boundary</font>

451
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,250
that was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> alien world to you know if</font>

452
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,170
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to you know protect</font>

453
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,610
radio traffic so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

454
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,250
the the world has changed a lot and

455
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,920
these new systems are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you</font>

456
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,300
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a sort of a hard to draw</font>

457
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,420
broad picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that you know the</font>

458
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,540
20th century systems sort of you know

459
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,949
evolved as in kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuity in a</font>

460
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,140
world that made sense but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

461
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,670
you know and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of culminated in PK</font>

462
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,110
odd but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> with public key crypto</font>

463
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,209
with the way new messaging systems work

464
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,560
we're seeing kind of an inversion and

465
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,450
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems are built and I think</font>

466
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,040
that you know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> future systems</font>

467
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,200
are going to follow those lines and

468
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,230
going to be defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of you know</font>

469
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,100
just building out you know encryption

470
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,180
layers and they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

471
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,230
authentication on top of them and I

472
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's the direction we should</font>

473
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,040
broadly try to work in is thinking about

474
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we can do some cripple or things and</font>

475
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,689
move out horizontally and then build

476
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,640
authentication more elaborate

477
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,030
authentication sort of vertically upon

478
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,250
that so that's kind of my like

479
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,260
pontificating about key agreement let's

480
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,160
talk about the protocols that some of

481
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,720
these messaging systems are using a

482
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
little bit so in the 1990s when people

483
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,410
started applying public key crypto for

484
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
real it seems pretty obvious that there

485
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,580
were two classes of protocols you<font color="#CCCCCC"> either</font>

486
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign and encrypt messages like p GPRS</font>

487
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,520
mime or you negotiate a session via some

488
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,710
handshake protocol like TLS or<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH and</font>

489
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,030
then use the negotiated session key and

490
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,010
that can give you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> better things</font>

491
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward secrecy but it hasn't</font>

492
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,040
of interaction the 2000s<font color="#CCCCCC"> er came along</font>

493
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,919
and applied the concepts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

494
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,540
interactive protocol to interactive text

495
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,100
messaging and have added some clever

496
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,830
ideas it added the idea of a deniable

497
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,209
key agreement where you can arrive on a

498
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,220
key but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually signing</font>

499
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,200
every single message or signing who

500
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,880
you're communicating with so you're not

501
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,760
producing a record that can be used

502
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,920
against you to increment<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you I think</font>

503
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,230
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea if you are also</font>

504
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,090
pioneered the idea of after you've done

505
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,010
this key agreement stage then doing

506
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that Adam Langley ended up</font>

507
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,870
calling a ratcheting protocol where you

508
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,980
just continually update your keys as you

509
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,239
as you send messages so you're

510
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,600
continually upgrading your forward

511
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:25,180
secrecy as you communicate so and that

512
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,439
looks something like this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

they send a dippy Hellman public key and

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,669
when the data receive the other person's

516
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,100
public key they replace theirs and then

517
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,720
their counterparty receives their public

518
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,149
key and replaces that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a pimp</font>

started with otrs<font color="#CCCCCC"> the base and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

528
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,840
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adapt it to an asynchronous</font>

case with more longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> live sessions and</font>

530
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,379
so there were a few adaptations one was

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,970
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key agreement so that it</font>

allowing the recipient of a message to

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of publish some what we called pre</font>

535
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,190
keys which were like the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

536
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,230
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> na ke protocol so you publish a bunch</font>

537
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,030
of pre keys to a server so when someone

538
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants to do the the handshake with you</font>

539
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the handshake is already sort of</font>

540
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,190
half done they just have to retrieve

541
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,900
those messages from the server complete

542
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,550
the a ke at that point they have a

543
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,530
shared secret that you can finish once

544
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,080
you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first message then you have</font>

545
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,270
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same point we wanted to</font>

546
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">use these sessions for longer periods of</font>

547
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,940
time so we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend the</font>

548
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,439
ratcheting so that if you were to send a

549
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,260
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages in sequence you would</font>

550
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,640
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> replacing the keys with every</font>

551
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">message sent and received instead of</font>

552
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,059
just

553
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:53,519
facing them with every round trip so we

554
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">added an additional degree of symmetric</font>

555
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,059
key ratcheting on top of the d8

556
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:59,399
ratcheting and that ended up was kind of

557
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,799
the core to party element of the signal

558
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,238
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't want</font>

559
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,940
just to party messaging they want

560
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:07,590
multi-party messaging and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

561
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,789
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably see in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

562
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,129
spaces and people building their

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,749
multi-party messaging on top of the

564
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:14,850
two-party protocol so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send</font>

565
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:17,460
multiple messages to people to

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,949
communicate to a group to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

567
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,179
efficient you might often want to do

568
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,769
things such as what signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple sender</font>

569
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,999
keys where you send a single symmetric

570
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,429
key to everyone in a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then use</font>

571
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:32,700
that symmetric<font color="#E5E5E5"> key for future messages</font>

572
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,480
and also give them a femoral finding key

573
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,149
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send those messages</font>

574
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,559
it would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> those message with so that</font>

575
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:40,168
the server can do sort of server-side

576
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,980
fan out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of messages so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

577
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:46,200
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more efficient multi-party</font>

578
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,840
protocols or on top of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-party</font>

579
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,009
protocol and then you can build

580
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,449
multi-device protocols on top of

581
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:54,210
multi-party by just treating every

582
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,669
device is sort of a different as a

583
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,989
different party to be communicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

584
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,909
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's like a pretty common</font>

585
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:01,200
stack that signal is following that a

586
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,119
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things are following which</font>

587
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,679
is to you know take a two-party

588
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,720
framework they'll multi-party on top of

589
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,210
that those multi-device on top of

590
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,330
multi-party there's still open questions

591
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,039
within this framework for example

592
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,369
managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of metadata in the</font>

593
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,259
group in a multi-party communication who

594
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,999
who's in the group who's allowed to

595
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,619
modify his in the group is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

596
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">information stored centrally or is it</font>

597
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:27,389
distributed systems are making different

598
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,350
decisions there in the multi-device case

599
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:31,080
there's some interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> design</font>

600
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,090
questions around do all the different

601
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,710
devices that represent me share the same

602
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,480
key because I've synchronized it across

603
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,480
devices or do they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

604
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
keys which makes the authentication more

605
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,259
challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm no longer</font>

606
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">represented by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key on a cloud</font>

607
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,039
keys so I need to reflect that in the

608
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">authentication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some out so there's you</font>

609
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,399
know a number of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mechanical</font>

610
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,428
questions being worked out here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

611
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:54,658
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the predominant question for</font>

612
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:56,129
these service systems it's you know

613
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,929
really bugs me and it's really

614
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenging is how you deal with things</font>

615
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,879
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know metadata and how we can do</font>

616
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,879
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> better job</font>

617
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,080
from leaking huge amounts of metadata so

618
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,690
that's that's gonna have to be a talk

619
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,129
for another time and no one's really did

620
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,690
a great job with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet so let me</font>

621
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:24,760
finish with that and take some questions

622
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:28,430
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for questions</font>

623
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,520
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with one by me you had this</font>

624
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">flight with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack and you're saying</font>

625
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that signal and other systems are going</font>

626
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,040
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to party to the multi-party</font>

627
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,379
setting is it possible that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

628
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,480
get better security and efficiency by

629
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:46,010
going straight for a multi-party

630
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,650
protocol from the office um something

631
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,790
question and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's</font>

632
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,350
certainly work on things like

633
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,260
multi-party<font color="#CCCCCC"> key agreements in the form</font>

634
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,860
of like you know ring based protocols

635
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:01,100
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burmester domest I'm probably not</font>

636
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,560
pronouncing that right or kll those tend

637
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,600
to be pretty interactive protocols so

638
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,520
they don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe we're terribly well</font>

639
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,129
in an asynchronous setting I think those

640
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,450
protocols also once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to add</font>

641
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,650
authentication to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to</font>

642
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,720
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing pairwise authentication</font>

643
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,150
anyways so that you're not going to get

644
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of benefits versus just a standard</font>

645
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Keys model where the sender just</font>

646
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,770
initially sends one key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a bunch of</font>

647
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,790
people then<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses it forward so I don't</font>

648
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> those are going to give you a lot</font>

649
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,820
of improvement yesterday's<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

650
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,010
that outlined using the sponge

651
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,480
construction for automatic crediting I

652
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,510
don't know what if you have any thoughts

653
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,970
about that approach um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

654
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,410
that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you could insert that it</font>

655
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,460
probably the lower level here because

656
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,990
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're like</font>

657
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,610
absorbing a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> key material right</font>

658
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,960
and the sponge is kind of a natural fit

659
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,250
for that and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

660
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,440
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see I think a</font>

661
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,860
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of protocol nowadays like TLS 1.3 or</font>

662
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,420
the sponge or other things I've worked

663
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">on but that there's a lot of these kind</font>

664
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,990
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-stage key agreement protocols</font>

665
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolve the keys so there's</font>

666
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,650
interesting questions about how you

667
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,500
either use H<font color="#CCCCCC"> kdf to sort of absorb the</font>

668
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,760
keys in a really good way or our sponges

669
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe a more natural fit for that I</font>

670
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think those are good questions that I'd</font>

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to see more people think about is</font>

672
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,889
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual security models for</font>

673
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,140
these kind of symmetric key

674
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,790
constructions and what are

675
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,870
you know maybe more optimized ways of

676
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:23,080
doing that you mentioned this movement

677
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,090
from authenticate to encrypt towards

678
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,649
this encrypt and authenticate model and

679
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,220
I wondering how much of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

680
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">is based on the lowering of costs around</font>

681
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,860
the client generating its own key for

682
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,980
example those other<font color="#CCCCCC"> factors what you</font>

683
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,120
think those<font color="#CCCCCC"> other factors might be I</font>

684
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it's using the cost of just</font>

685
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,899
generating a key<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cost of generating</font>

686
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,570
key is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because keys car keys are</font>

687
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,910
these are cheap there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other</font>

688
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,740
costs with authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not</font>

689
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,090
generating<font color="#CCCCCC"> mekia to the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

690
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,650
you want user to really be involved in

691
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,030
the authentication they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have</font>

692
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,710
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font>

693
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,149
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system or choose</font>

694
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,160
to use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other system that's not the</font>

695
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,500
default system or do some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

696
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,850
band<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks so I think that</font>

697
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,050
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> does bring a lot of costs</font>

698
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,389
those costs are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to user</font>

699
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,000
interaction or user trust decisions more

700
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,110
than you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything really mechanical</font>

701
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,240
and I do you think that eliminating

702
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,590
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs is a lot of why systems are</font>

703
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,670
deploying encryption is kind of a

704
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:21,100
baseline and then authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> in more</font>

705
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:23,140
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 fashion is being used sort of on</font>

706
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,909
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

707
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really based on so for</font>

708
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,480
example mobile devices like many mobile

709
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,210
devices didn't really have the

710
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,850
capability of generating keys in any

711
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,100
good way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> over time you've watched</font>

712
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,290
the cost of actually doing that decrease

713
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,750
right so now you can actually generally

714
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,670
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> II generate a reasonable key on a</font>

715
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,740
mobile device whereas you previously

716
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,210
couldn't do that yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very</font>

717
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,980
true i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's it's hard to</font>

718
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,780
disentangle that from the fact that we

719
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,400
also just are using our mobile devices a

720
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,290
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we using social networks</font>

721
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,090
and we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know different things</font>

722
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,260
there's like all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> factors in the</font>

723
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,540
mobile space that are happening at once

724
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's true that the devices are very</font>

725
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,010
powerful nowadays and you know basic

726
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,390
cryptography is really not a challenge

727
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,440
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple AK things at all</font>

728
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:12,100
disappeared shave you thank you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

729
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:17,880
do encryption in signal did you have any

730
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:21,159
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the abuse or this pump um</font>

731
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,810
signal is maybe not popular enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

732
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,910
wildly abused or wildly spammed

733
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,490
I think you know other systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

734
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,170
have dealt with those problems more so

735
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">than we have I think Facebook's done</font>

736
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:36,160
some interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things around the</font>

737
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,389
franking mechanism as a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of</font>

738
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,270
demonstrate to the server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

739
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,800
received an abusive message and that

740
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,470
they convened take actions upon so

741
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,820
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism to look at you</font>

742
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,710
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the systems still have a lot of</font>

743
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,659
metadata available to them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

744
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,520
truth sending messages the rate at which

745
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,890
messages are being sent so that's a lot

746
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,629
of metadata<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can use for spam</font>

747
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,340
and ni views i think that problem gets a

748
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,680
lot worse if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to move towards</font>

749
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,480
metadata hiding systems and more

750
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,830
anonymous systems and you start needing

751
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,300
like anonymous networks anonymous

752
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,649
credentials things like that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

753
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,810
spam and abuse problem becomes much

754
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,880
worse there and much harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

755
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,879
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> open research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

756
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,290
well it's a no more questions then let's

757
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,200
let's thank Trevor one more time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

758
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:27,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">great oak thank you very much</font>

759
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,709
