<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be talking about n</font>

modification to the domain name security

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,360
extensions we've been working on this

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,309
project for a couple years now so

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,750
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> today I'm presenting completely</font>

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,280
new results in the sense that we've

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,250
spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time implementing and</font>

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,119
optimizing this scheme so the

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,130
performance results that i'm showing you

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,750
are completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and new and</font>

12
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this implementation and optimization is</font>

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,039
both on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns side and also on the</font>

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,470
crypto side this is joint work with a

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,309
also have collaborators at verisign labs

20
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so before we get into DNS SEC let's</font>

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,750
talk about how DNS works so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am on</font>

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,149
my laptop at home and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

23
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">send a query to I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get data</font>

24
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,170
from a calm so I need to know its IP

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,270
address so what I'm going to do is I'm

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipad bdnf for the IP</font>

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">address for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name a calm the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
this is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go send a query to</font>

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,449
my local recursive resolver the resolver

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,188
will go out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet find the</font>

31
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,340
name server that is authoritative for

32
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,189
the.com zone send the a calm query to

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,170
that name server get the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

34
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,809
response and then relay that over to me

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,790
and now I know the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address for the a</font>

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,840
calm website and I can go visit it and

37
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,270
I'm happy ok so that's DNS in a second

38
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,490
DNS SEC focuses on the exchange between

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,890
the resolver and the name server the

40
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,470
goal of DNS SEC is to provide integrity

41
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,790
so very simply speaking we want to

42
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,500
prevent a man-in-the-middle from

43
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,220
modifying their responses we get from

44
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authoritative name server okay so</font>

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,600
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> n sex five so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encik five deals</font>

46
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,939
with a very particular problem in DNS

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,470
SEC it's the denial of existence problem

48
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,740
so in this little picture I'm showing

49
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,720
you i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> QB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you edu which is a</font>

50
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,640
website that doesn't exist the name

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,170
doesn't exist so what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns has to</font>

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,450
tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this name doesn't exist</font>

53
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,040
so on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are various proposals for</font>

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,719
authenticated denial of existence

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,689
showing that a name doesn't exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> ence</font>

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">x5 is one of them all the other ones are</font>

57
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,979
standardized by the way this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,959
modification so what ends x5 provides is

59
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,520
integrity not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> against man in the</font>

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle but also if the name server</font>

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,860
itself is compromised

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,049
it also has a second property which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

63
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,310
the prevention of zone enumeration I'm

64
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:21,159
going to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

65
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,290
in the talk so new results that I'm

66
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present today we've spent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

67
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,519
of time optimizing and took five so<font color="#CCCCCC"> n65</font>

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,840
we now have it based on elliptic curve

69
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,450
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a new result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk</font>

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,239
about we have fully specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> m65 we've</font>

71
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,920
submitted a draft to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also</font>

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,110
presenting results from<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation</font>

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,268
and performance results but Demetrius

74
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,730
just got yesterday so these are

75
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:44,319
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> new so before i get into the</font>

76
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,910
performance results i have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,170
basically what ends like five is and in

78
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,540
order to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to go through</font>

79
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,220
sort of the history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the denial of</font>

80
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,190
existence mechanisms used in DNS SEC

81
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is the background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

82
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,200
so how does a denial of existence

83
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:01,780
initially done in DNS SEC so DNS SEC has

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,518
a public key that for the zone this is

85
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,810
known to all resolvers using DNS SEC

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,480
mechanisms that we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

87
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">about today we have our name server we</font>

88
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,290
have our zone these are the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,790
are present<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the zone these are n sec</font>

90
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,379
records these are the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you answer</font>

91
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,290
queries for names that are not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,910
zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what these n sec records do</font>

93
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,858
is they take all the names in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the zone</font>

94
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,840
they sort them<font color="#E5E5E5"> lexa graphically so you</font>

95
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,940
see them alphabetical order here then

96
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,590
you take every consecutive pair and find

97
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,540
them using the secret zone signing key

98
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,310
so this record is fine it can be

99
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,510
verified using the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone planning</font>

100
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,040
key ok so the query comes in for qcom we

101
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,108
can see that this name doesn't exist in

102
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,608
our zone so we need to answer the query

103
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,260
what we're going to do is we're going to

104
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">just look up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end SEC record that</font>

105
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,269
covers this query you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> qcom</font>

106
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,099
falls between seacom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> vidcom so you</font>

107
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,019
know that this n SEC record proves to

108
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,298
you that qcom is not present in the zone

109
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,459
ok so that was denial of existence in

110
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,470
the DNS SEC the very first version of

111
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it worked but if we look at what's</font>

112
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,370
happening here our resolver not only

113
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,769
learned that qcom is not present in the

114
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,959
zone it actually learned that sorry

115
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,870
that's validating<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so it also learned</font>

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,370
that see calm and dead calm are present

117
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,900
in the zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so it to learn some</font>

118
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,879
additional information<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's learned that</font>

119
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">these names are in the zone and actually</font>

120
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,329
it's pretty trivial to enumerate the

121
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,639
entire zone to identify all the names in

122
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the zone so here he's asking a query for</font>

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,080
be calm which comes before<font color="#CCCCCC"> see calm he's</font>

124
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,360
learned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a calm is in the zone and</font>

125
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how this leads to an</font>

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,110
query way of enumerated all end names in

127
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,419
the zone if there ends and names in the

128
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,340
zone okay so this is not just a

129
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,438
theoretical thing these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font>

130
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,878
enumeration attack is built into network

131
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,620
reconnaissance software you have for

132
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,110
example a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into n map that will</font>

133
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,659
do this for you this was enough of an

134
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,849
issue to lead to the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> of em</font>

135
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,039
sex3 which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to raise the bar</font>

136
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,360
for zoned enumeration attacks some of

137
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,039
the reasons given for<font color="#E5E5E5"> why zone</font>

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,500
enumeration is an issue for example the

139
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,449
RFC's mentioned that registries may have

140
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,810
legal obligations to protect their zone

141
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,919
contents from a more technical

142
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,840
standpoint you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of not wanting</font>

143
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,460
to expose all the names in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone to</font>

144
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,469
any arbitrary person that's querying

145
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,120
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance think about</font>

146
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:08,590
Internet of Things devices in there you

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,509
may not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose their addresses</font>

148
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,150
you might think of the DDoS mitigation

149
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,620
where you want to hide the names an IPS

150
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,388
of servers so that they can't be

151
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,550
attacked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in</font>

152
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so zone enumeration kind of</font>

153
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,539
Swartz all of these security mechanisms

154
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,889
so this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered an issue so</font>

155
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,469
it was enough of an issue to lead to the

156
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,629
development of em sex3<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here's</font>

157
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:30,159
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sex3 works we still we have the</font>

158
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,529
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our zone I'm now showing you</font>

159
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,479
how to pre-compute than 63 records we

160
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,310
have the names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zone we have some</font>

161
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,318
each each one of them so this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

162
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,509
sha-1<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash of each name we got these</font>

163
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">three values then we sort them</font>

164
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,229
lexicographically so here you see they

165
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in alphabetical order and then we do</font>

166
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

167
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,580
sign every pair using the zone signing

168
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,020
key and now we have n secre<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 records ok</font>

169
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,520
so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like an SEC records</font>

170
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,469
but instead of having the names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,799
clear we replace the names with their

172
00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:01,839
hash values<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as before we give</font>

173
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,020
these n sex3 records to the name server

174
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,089
and now every time he gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> a query in he</font>

175
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,219
again will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up an N sex3 record and</font>

176
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,589
returneth how does he do the lookup he

177
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,629
takes the query he hashes it he gets

178
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:15,729
this value here and he looks for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> N</font>

179
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,439
sex3 records that covers it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

180
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,359
see that see blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah falls</font>

181
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,089
between a blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah de blah blah</font>

182
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,460
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the covering n sex3 record</font>

183
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:26,650
and now the revolver can verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

184
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,750
this is the correct proof that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this name</font>

185
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,580
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the zone because the</font>

186
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,439
value falls between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> values here</font>

187
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,870
and he can validate the signature with

188
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,810
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone signing key ok so that's</font>

189
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">done sex3 so now we need to talk about</font>

190
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,219
zone enumeration

191
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:43,749
we can think about zone enumeration in

192
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,639
this setting actually there still is a

193
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:47,050
zone enumeration attack here this was

194
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,149
first talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> by bernstein it's</font>

195
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,830
been implemented by lots of people maybe

196
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,239
not first anyway it was talked about by

197
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,729
bernstein and various people have

198
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:57,188
implemented this thing so I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

199
00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense x3 record here it's got two hash</font>

200
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:02,469
values here so what my zone enumerated

201
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,359
attacker is going to do is he's going to

202
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:07,089
just collect values for men sex<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

203
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,429
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here he can just send n</font>

204
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:11,050
online queries just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> all n the</font>

205
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,539
hash values in the zone so now you've

206
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,339
got all the hash names in the zone now

207
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hash so now we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do an</font>

208
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:19,629
offline dictionary attack similar to

209
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,639
password cracking and we reverse the

210
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,619
hash values in the zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this has</font>

211
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">been implemented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is you can</font>

212
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">use this as part of n map if you want to</font>

213
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:31,629
do n sex3 reconnaissance for his own and

214
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:33,219
this this research paper found that they

215
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,789
could reverse sixty-four percent of the

216
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:38,469
hashes in the.com voiced one GPU so zone

217
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:42,369
enumeration is still possible at n 63

218
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:44,679
it's just more work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so actually</font>

219
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:46,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">this leaves you in a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

220
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,229
you want to use DNS SEC today and you

221
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,119
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have though nanoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maury</font>

222
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,459
shin at all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move to online</font>

223
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,019
signing ok so what online planning does

224
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,869
is it changes what's happening here

225
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,369
previously our name server had<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre</font>

226
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:59,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">computed records that it was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

227
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:01,119
to respond to queries what we're now

228
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,949
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we're going to give the</font>

229
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,509
zone signing key to the name server

230
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,039
which by the way means that if the name

231
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:08,679
server is compromised the entire

232
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,058
security of the zone is gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but in</font>

233
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:12,489
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> case you give the key to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

234
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:14,349
server and now whenever a query comes in

235
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,779
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute an N sex3 record</font>

236
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:18,938
on the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm just going to hatch</font>

237
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,829
the value here's the hash and I'm just

238
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,229
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take plus 1 and minus 1 of this</font>

239
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:24,639
hash value and generate an N sex3

240
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,229
records that contains those two values

241
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,929
so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value here</font>

242
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:30,818
falls between these two values and now

243
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,409
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a covering and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sex3</font>

244
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,568
record for the query that was generated

245
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,218
on the fly and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great we don't</font>

246
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:37,990
have zone enumeration because these hash

247
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,189
values are independent of any names that

248
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,198
are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the zone and they just</font>

249
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:43,448
depend on the query<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is how</font>

250
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:46,959
we do the prevention of zone enumeration

251
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:48,579
now with DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go over</font>

252
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,180
these are the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> schemes that we</font>

253
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:53,319
have we have legacy DNS which never had

254
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,079
a zone enumeration pro

255
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,520
before it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy DNS if you'd like</font>

256
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn the names in the zone you need</font>

257
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,689
to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> an online query for every name</font>

258
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,730
you suspect in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is in the zone that</font>

259
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,680
was the state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world with DNS but</font>

260
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,660
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no integrity so</font>

261
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,459
there was no authentication for the for

262
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,750
the nope no signatures on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages</font>

263
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,080
so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> man in the middle could tamper with</font>

264
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,970
the messages then we have n<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex3 which</font>

265
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,380
has this offline zone enumeration

266
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,330
through the dictionary attack that we

267
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,310
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so you can make n online</font>

268
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,200
queries and then do offline zone a

269
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,939
dictionary attacks to recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names</font>

270
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,350
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zone but it does provide</font>

271
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,690
integrity against the man in the middle

272
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we have online signing which</font>

273
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,050
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this offline zone</font>

274
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,170
enumeration problem and doesn't have a

275
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with outsider attacks right but</font>

276
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,650
in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an online</font>

277
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,170
cryptographic signature and give the

278
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,790
zone signing key to the name server<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

279
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,979
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two things to say about that</font>

280
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,140
we can see the downside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

281
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,550
finding is that the the secret key has

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name service of the</font>

283
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,959
nameservers compromise the integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

284
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,670
the zone is lost and<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is in</font>

285
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,780
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper from a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago we</font>

286
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">proved that any scheme that both</font>

287
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,350
prevents offline zone enumeration and

288
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,930
provides integrity against outsiders

289
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,480
must necessarily perform one online

290
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,849
public key crypto operation / negative

291
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,530
response so in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense online finding</font>

292
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,450
the fact that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing online crypto</font>

293
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,890
here we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do online crypto in</font>

294
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,050
order to have both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> properties</font>

295
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,449
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of why we see the state</font>

296
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this ok so what does</font>

297
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">ntek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 view and sex 5 prevents offline</font>

298
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,380
zone enumeration without having to give

299
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,300
up integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the name server is</font>

300
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,830
compromised ok so that's the trick that

301
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,689
we use in n sec 5 and now i'm going to

302
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,060
to show you why this works and just I

303
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,790
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that in order to do this</font>

304
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,109
we do have to perform a public heath

305
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,250
operation not a signature but a public

306
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,200
key operation for every negative

307
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,660
response this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is necessary we showed it</font>

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,940
in this theorem<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so now let me show</font>

309
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">you how insects five works ok so just</font>

310
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,190
revisiting why would zone enumeration

311
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,230
possible with M sex3 the reason was our

312
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,820
attacker just collects all the hashes in

313
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,920
the zone which he can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with n queries</font>

314
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,330
and then he cracks them and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

315
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,209
he can crack them is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

316
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,980
compute hashes offline by himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

317
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,990
he can hash by himself that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crux</font>

318
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,560
of the issue so what we're going to do a

319
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,270
10 sec 5 is we're going to

320
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,130
get rid of this hash function which was

321
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,750
what was used in n<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec 3 and we're going</font>

322
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use a new kind of quote-unquote hash</font>

323
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,220
function which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a verifiable random</font>

324
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,750
function so for cryptographers most of

325
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,210
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cryptographers maybe you've seen</font>

326
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,490
this before this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like a</font>

327
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,170
keyed version of a hash function but

328
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,180
it's a public key version of the hash

329
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,400
function<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a secret key that's</font>

330
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,109
used to compute the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash and a public</font>

331
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
key that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate that the</font>

332
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,970
hash is correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is what</font>

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to use in n sex life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

334
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,320
here's how it goes we have our names in

335
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,870
the zone and now we're going to hatch

336
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,580
them quote unquote with the vrf with the

337
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,589
verifiable random function this hash

338
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,020
uses a secret key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a secret key</font>

339
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,339
of the vrf<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here is basically</font>

340
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,839
what my hash is I'm going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

341
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,190
name I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to it</font>

342
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,900
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the secret key and I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

343
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,640
a value in a second I'll tell you what

344
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,020
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to it I'm going to do</font>

345
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,370
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of the names this</font>

346
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,350
should look familiar this is exactly

347
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,470
what we did with<font color="#CCCCCC"> unsex three so we do a</font>

348
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,500
vrf computation on each name we get all

349
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,900
these values we sort them and then we

350
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,520
signed them using real exit graphically

351
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,650
sort them and then we find every pair

352
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,689
using the zone signing key so we get

353
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,250
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> n65 records okay so this is</font>

354
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,350
exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before except</font>

355
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,130
instead of using sha-1 here we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

356
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,810
vrf<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what is this vrf so the</font>

357
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,060
first version of n sec 5 that we

358
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented a couple of years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vrf</font>

359
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,400
was based on our essay so in this vrs

360
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,069
the pie function here was basically a

361
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,890
deterministic RSA signature so I was a

362
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,990
full domain hash RSA signature and this

363
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,210
hash function here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just shot 256</font>

364
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we basically take an RSA</font>

365
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,190
signature apply to a 256 to it and that

366
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,680
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us our v RF output okay the new</font>

367
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,420
version the new version events like five

368
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,319
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

369
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,939
actually not going to show you the

370
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,740
crypto behind it but the crypto comes

371
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,810
from this paper by<font color="#E5E5E5"> franklin and zhang</font>

372
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,970
actually the construction appeared in

373
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,319
there it wasn't supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a vrf it</font>

374
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,420
was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for something else so we</font>

375
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,800
proved<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a vrf and actually this</font>

376
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,110
construction turns out to be much more

377
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,520
performant than the RSA construction

378
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,529
i'll show you the performance results in

379
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,160
later slides so in that construction

380
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,390
this pie is an elliptic curve comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses</font>

381
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,760
elliptic curves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to tell</font>

382
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,220
you more about it than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

383
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,590
that's our vrf so here's our n sec 5

384
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,660
records that we pre computed and now we

385
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,980
give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the nameserver ok notice</font>

386
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,920
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have not given the name server</font>

387
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,290
the secret zone signing key however we

388
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,000
do have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> VRS key that we have to give</font>

389
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,250
so first of all the VRS comes with a

390
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,740
public key that everybody learns using

391
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,110
the usual DNS SEC mechanisms and then

392
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,640
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a secret key for the vrf</font>

393
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,460
and that's what we're going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving</font>

394
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,140
to our name<font color="#CCCCCC"> server so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secret v RF q</font>

395
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,400
is given to this guy here in a second

396
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to tell you why this is ok but</font>

397
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,949
for now let's just talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we're</font>

398
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,490
going to do with this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so how</font>

399
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,230
does n sec 5 work when a query comes in

400
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,120
the name server needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what</font>

401
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,100
n sec 5 record that has to deliver to

402
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the query</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ER so how is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he going to do</font>

403
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,950
that well he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

404
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote-unquote hash the query so he has</font>

405
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,070
to compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vrf value so the first</font>

406
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,720
thing he's going to do is he's going to

407
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,820
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pie function apply it to the</font>

408
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,370
name and get this value that's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

409
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,310
secret vrf key then he's going to hash

410
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,190
this output and then he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

411
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">this value here this value is now he's</font>

412
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to look up the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n sec 5</font>

413
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,380
records that covers this value so you

414
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,479
can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> three blah blah blah comes</font>

415
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,390
before seven and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I eat comes after</font>

416
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,370
so this n sec 5 record covers this value

417
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:35,040
here and now he delivers it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

418
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,750
resolver<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so at this point you should</font>

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,910
say wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute how can you verify</font>

420
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,680
this thing right because the resolver

421
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,839
cannot compute this hash value on its

422
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,670
own how is he going to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

423
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,140
what we do in n sec 5 is we provide an

424
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,380
additional piece of information which is

425
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> N sex five proof the insects</font>

426
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 proof is just the output of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pie</font>

427
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,109
function so we take the output of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

428
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,839
pie function and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it along with</font>

429
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,250
the N sex I've record ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

430
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">server computes this thing sends it</font>

431
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,540
along and again in our RSA version this

432
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just an RSA signature we send this</font>

433
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,860
along and then to verify we have two

434
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,290
steps the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing we do is we check</font>

435
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec 5 covers the proof so we</font>

436
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,150
just hash this value and check that it

437
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,530
falls between these two values then the

438
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,630
next thing we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we check that the</font>

439
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,280
proof and the query actually match so

440
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,220
again in the RSA version the proof is

441
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,770
just an RSA signature on qcom so this

442
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,360
amounts to an RSA that verification<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

443
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,920
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the query we take the proof we</font>

444
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,900
verify them and if they match we know

445
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,040
that these match and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we verify</font>

446
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,750
the signature on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N sec 5 record</font>

447
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,670
and now we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this name doesn't</font>

448
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,920
exist in the zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sensex</font>

449
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to give a proof record we have</font>

450
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,410
additional keys which is specifically

451
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,329
used friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> x5 and we have to do this</font>

452
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,550
online computation in order to respond

453
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,989
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the query</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the online computation</font>

454
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,459
by the way is comparable to what you do

455
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,170
an online finding today in order to

456
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:56,439
avoid zone enumeration they also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

457
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,469
do an online computation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to</font>

458
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,699
compare these different schemes why

459
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,190
doesn't like five prevent zone

460
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,649
enumeration very quickly we cannot

461
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,329
compute vrf hashes on our own so that

462
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that the zone enumerator cannot</font>

463
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,949
actually do these offline dictionary

464
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,509
attacks because we can't hash by himself

465
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:15,279
we do need to perform an online crypto

466
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:16,660
operation when responding to a query but

467
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,240
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary by the theory that</font>

468
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,469
we've theorem then we proved and finally

469
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,639
I need to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you why this provides</font>

470
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,920
integrity and that's what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

471
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,589
do next so here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my proof of why and</font>

472
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,750
sec 5 provides integrity even if the

473
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,060
zone even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the name server is</font>

474
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,980
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's our attacker</font>

475
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,439
he's compromised the name server he

476
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,300
stole the key so now he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> this key and</font>

477
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,240
he needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince us that something</font>

478
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not in the zone even when it is that</font>

479
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,930
would be an attack right so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

480
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,279
ask for a calm and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell me</font>

481
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,779
know this doesn't exist in the zone

482
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,069
that's what he's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do he's</font>

483
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me the wrong answer as</font>

484
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,610
you can see a does exist in this zone

485
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so here's what he's going to</font>

486
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,579
do first thing he's going to do is he's

487
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,290
going to compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> a proof record actually</font>

488
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is totally easy for him to do</font>

489
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">because he had this the vrf key and he</font>

490
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,540
can compute the proof on his own

491
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:03,490
remember this is just done basically in

492
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,309
the RSA version it's an RSA signature on

493
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,079
the query so he can produce this proof

494
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,359
on his own the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that</font>

495
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,359
the vrf has this property that the proof

496
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,549
at least the RSA vrf and this follows to

497
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,889
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vrs as well the proof value</font>

498
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,929
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be unique given the</font>

499
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,189
query and the public key ok so there's

500
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:24,309
only one value that could possibly

501
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,260
appear here and so this value better be

502
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,209
correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because the verifier is</font>

503
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,220
going to use the vrf key to verify the

504
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:33,100
proof so this proof value is actually

505
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,780
the correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof value ok so now our</font>

506
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,549
attacker needs to give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> unsec five</font>

507
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,350
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> that convince us that a calm is</font>

508
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:40,090
not in the zone but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he doesn't know the</font>

509
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,799
zone signing key the secret key because

510
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,139
it's not given to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name server so he</font>

511
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,480
can't for gin suc five records so he has

512
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,130
to replay the

513
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,960
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now if we look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the n</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suck 5</font>

514
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">records he has available actually none</font>

515
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,809
of them are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in terms of</font>

516
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,540
replay this one doesn't work it doesn't

517
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,730
cover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proof value which</font>

518
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,860
starts with nine this one doesn't cover

519
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,690
it if actually it matches it this one

520
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,918
doesn't cover it and matches it and so

521
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,070
none of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> records work there's</font>

522
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,419
nothing to replay and that's why

523
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,210
integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> is preserved even if the name</font>

524
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,100
server is compromised and the vrf key is

525
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,990
leaked<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's how we get the</font>

526
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,330
security events x5 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

527
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,150
about it this is exactly why n sex3 is

528
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,889
secure if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get rid of the vrs</font>

529
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,770
and just think of sha-1 this is exactly

530
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,429
why it works I it's the same idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

531
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just showed you why we have integrity</font>

532
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:30,120
even if the name server is compromised

533
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,330
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of the state of the</font>

534
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,729
world these are the options<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

535
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,860
offline zone enumeration be robust to

536
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,020
name server compromise but not and not

537
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,580
do online crypto<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so if you don't care</font>

538
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">about zone enumeration this is a good</font>

539
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,280
solution if you care about zone

540
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,020
enumeration in this solution you lose

541
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,418
integrity of the nameservers<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise</font>

542
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,240
and you have to do online crypto vs<font color="#CCCCCC"> n65</font>

543
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,799
where you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose integrity of the</font>

544
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,410
nameservers<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromise and you also have</font>

545
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do online crypto ok so that's</font>

546
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,100
basically the state of the world and now

547
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you some of our new</font>

548
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,409
performance results so we've actually

549
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,820
gone and implemented n sec 5 our

550
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,510
implementation extends existing DNS

551
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,850
commercially available open source

552
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,860
software so our name server

553
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,590
implementation uses not dns and our

554
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,110
recursive uses unbound we have both

555

versions of n<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec 5 implemented the RSA</font>

557
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,059
this new elliptic curve version i'm

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,140
going to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this version is</font>

really cool things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we incorporated</font>

some optimizations that the dns

564
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,030
were actually developed after n sex3

565
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,370
were standardized so they were never

566
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,230
actually used so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to</font>

567
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,909
incorporate these optimizations into and

568
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,669
65 and that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a much better</font>

569
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,990
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk too</font>

570
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,600
much more about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

571
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,970
this offline so nine thousand lines of

572
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,129
code we use openssl which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

573
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,370
inside these implementations so there's

574
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,930
no

575
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,639
dependencies we didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need any</font>

576
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,850
new crypto we just use the crypto that

577
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,650
was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and also the optimizations</font>

578
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,300
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all protocol</font>

579
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,220
level on San Jose shins we did not do

580
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,570
systems level optimizations here this is

581
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,240
just extensions of existing

582
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,399
implementations<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

583
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> length of</font>

584
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,410
the responses so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me let me just read</font>

585
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,090
to you this charter then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you</font>

586
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,610
why we care about this so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

587
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">response length in bytes this is the</font>

588
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,229
length of an Internet packet and these

589
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,820
are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions this is n sex3</font>

590
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:38,370
using RSA and sex3 using ecdsa this is n

591
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,189
sex3 online<font color="#E5E5E5"> fining using ecdsa so these</font>

592
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,699
things are roughly the same and 65 using

593
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,020
RSA and n 65 elliptic curves<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so first</font>

594
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,970
of all why do we care about response

595
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,679
links with with DNS SEC there's two

596
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,450
reasons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first of all in DNS</font>

597
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,429
when you send a query it goes over UDP

598
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you want the response to fit in a</font>

599
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,670
single packet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it doesn't</font>

600
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,309
you're the packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets fragmented and</font>

601
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,020
bad stuff happens or you have to redo

602
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,730
the query over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP which adds more</font>

603
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,710
latency so it's really nice if your

604
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,660
response fits in a single packet and we

605
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,350
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our RS a version of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NS x5</font>

606
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,020
actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the 1024 a 2048 version</font>

607
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,490
of n<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec 5 also doesn't fit into antic 3</font>

608
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,790
doesn't really fit into a single IP

609
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:20,730
packet either so these are bad things

610
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:23,879
but when we move to elliptic curve you

611
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,040
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that n sex3 does and n sec 5</font>

612
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">also does and in fact that the n sec 5</font>

613
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,850
based on elliptic curves in terms of

614
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,649
length is roughly comparable to n sex3

615
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,178
based on elliptic curves<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this</font>

616
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,800
comes from the fact that we've done the

617
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,990
elliptic curves optimizations and also

618
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS optimizations the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

619
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,620
why we care about this is actually

620
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,059
because the DNS can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

621
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,409
amplifier for distributed

622
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">denial-of-service attacks you can</font>

623
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,100
imagine an attacker spoofing the IP

624
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,510
address of the victim sending a query to

625
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,000
the name server and the name server

626
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,129
responds to the victim if that response

627
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,750
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big then the victim as</font>

628
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,910
you know the rate of packets going to

629
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,230
the victim gets higher rate of bits

630
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,300
going to the victim gets higher and

631
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,559
that's bad so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to blow up</font>

632
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of responses so that's</font>

633
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,730
another reason why I'm response<font color="#E5E5E5"> Winx</font>

634
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,230
matters ok so when we do n sec 5 with

635
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,880
elliptic curves are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not losing</font>

636
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:14,630
much in terms of response wings relative

637
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,500
chance x3<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and this is based on arm</font>

638
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,570
actually the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I want to say</font>

639
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that today most of the DNS SEC uses</font>

640
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,529
RSA 1024 not 2048 so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

641
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,539
response links look like basically many

642
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:29,190
implementations now many deployments now

643
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,840
we can see that moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to elliptic curve</font>

644
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 is actually shorter than</font>

645
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,299
what's currently being done in my

646
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,789
deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the last thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

647
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">show is on the throughput of our name</font>

648
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">server so what we did here was we set up</font>

649
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:48,179
a name server and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we I mean</font>

650
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:50,158
Demetrius<font color="#CCCCCC"> anshuman so there were 24</font>

651
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,539
threads running on 40 virtual CPU so

652
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,330
this was a big box what you might

653
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,220
imagine be acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a DNS server what</font>

654
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,860
we do is we send queries to this box at

655
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,049
a steady rate you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see we started</font>

656
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,729
8,000 queries per second up to 128

657
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,320
thousands queries per second and we see

658
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,049
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box can no longer respond</font>

659
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,539
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're maxes out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this</font>

660
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,639
this line here is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSX three line</font>

661
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,350
remember that n sex3 you actually don't

662
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,120
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do any online crypto you just</font>

663
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,490
have to do a hash and a look up so this

664
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,489
scales basically perfectly but this is a

665
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,250
log-log scale so this line is linear<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

666
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:26,130
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> n63</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has no problem scaling but when</font>

667
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start to turn on online signing this</font>

668

power<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS this is by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way everything</font>

670
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:35,010
here that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing other than this</font>

671
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:37,379
purple line is not DNS reason we use

672
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,629
power DNS escape our DNS was the only

673
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,730
open source RFC compliant thing that we

674
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,190
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that was doing online signing</font>

675
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,080
so we use that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation we can</font>

676
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,779
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that online finding with power DNS</font>

677
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,120
is maxing out around I think 21,000

678
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,100
queries per second our RSA

679
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,979
implementation of n sec 5 maxes out

680
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,350
similarly around like 19,000 queries per

681
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,270
second if we look at our end sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

682
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,199
elliptic curves and implantation we're

683
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,668
maxing out at 64,000 queries per second

684
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,289
so we're pretty excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

685
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,669
result<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really put this</font>

686
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,820
into context because this is from

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">yesterday it's bigger and one thing that</font>

688
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,799
we did do is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the average</font>

689
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,629
query rate at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root and that is about</font>

690
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">an order of magnitude lower than this on</font>

691
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">average so we think that these numbers</font>

692
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,090
are pretty good i'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk more</font>

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this included into the DNS SEC specs</font>

704
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,370
and the implementation is publicly is

705
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,320
publicly available so with that I'll

706
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,659
stop these are some memes that we didn't

707
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:08,960
make we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> found on this website thank</font>

708
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:11,940
you would you have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions so</font>

709
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">go right ahead thanks for the nice talk</font>

710
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,360
so I have two questions one the obvious

711
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:22,410
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happened to for what</font>

712
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,560
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as well really but the</font>

713
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:28,050
real question is so you talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

714
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,240
play and and how replaying doesn't work

715
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what how do you prevent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> replays from</font>

716
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,540
a previous time when there really wasn't

717
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,610
in a calm yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's kind of not</font>

718
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,590
my problem in a sense because that DNS

719
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,969
SEC has this problem anyway so the

720
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is how do i prevent sale</font>

721
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,690
records from being replayed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

722
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,920
honestly I can't answer this question

723
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,080
very well because there are all these

724
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,460
mechanisms like TTL that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

725
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,199
and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out exactly what the right</font>

726
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,820
TTL is and when you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> expire your</font>

727
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,680
signatures to make sure that things are

728
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,750
expired before you add<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new data so</font>

729
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that's dealt with in that way</font>

730
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,650
in DNS SEC we just like drop into our

731
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,470
scheme here so I you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

732
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,650
have a better answer than that insert

733
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:11,240
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time limits right correct</font>

734
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,240
largest right there right

735
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:27,158
so Trevor Perrin has a very fast and

736
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:29,259
simpler vrf called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bieksa at DSA so did</font>

737
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">you consider using any other vrf or</font>

738
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:33,279
would you consider that for I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

739
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:35,559
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about that that's really</font>

740
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting so I'd love to look more</font>

741
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that maybe even the same VRS I</font>

742
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,859
don't know um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be very yet no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> King</font>

743
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:43,749
which one you're using exactly yeah it's

744
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:45,728
time that we proved was a vrf sturm and

745
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:49,239
up being the same thing could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

746
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:53,619
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hi my name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> victor de Kuff</font>

747
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:55,929
my work I'm Dana bunch depends on DNS

748
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:58,359
SEC I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly a</font>

749
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,819
question or a comment but for many

750
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,239
domains the highest risk is operational

751
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:06,489
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the crypto people forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

752
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:09,429
redo their offline signing and their

753
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:11,829
domain disappears of the internet so for

754
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,899
folks without very strong operational

755
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:16,379
discipline and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> support teams</font>

756
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:19,448
and so on actually having the key

757
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:22,539
present on the name server is important

758
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:24,789
so that you can keep signing right so

759
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:27,999
the DNS X became a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more reliable</font>

760
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:29,679
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> bind implemented auto maintain and</font>

761
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:31,359
people could leave their keys online and

762
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,549
have the name server automatically

763
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,158
resigned I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course the</font>

764
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:38,829
roots and dot com and so on have ways of

765
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,219
doing offline signing reliably but for

766
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:43,989
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of average much smaller domain</font>

767
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:47,229
the keys do have to be online because

768
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:50,649
otherwise the risk of going dark is much

769
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:53,349
higher than any risk from<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised so</font>

770
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:55,149
that's sort of a trade-off that people

771
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:57,668
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of isn't that offline</font>

772
00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:01,359
signing is cool but most people can't do

773
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:04,079
it reliably i think that's that's all I

774
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,079
to say for the moment

775
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,280
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I just I just wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

776
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:16,670
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I I take that point I</font>

777
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:21,530
think just what we can i get my slide

778
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:23,660
back up please all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just wanted</font>

779
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

780
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,830
want all of these things this is this is

781
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,230
the way that we're proposing that it

782
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,179
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right so again if you don't</font>

783
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,860
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about zone enumeration then you</font>

784
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:41,360
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this but if you do</font>

785
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:43,610
then this is this is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

786
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:50,459
right so that thing showing

787
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:50,459
[Applause]
