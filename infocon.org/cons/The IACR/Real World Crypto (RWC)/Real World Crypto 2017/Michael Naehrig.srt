1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I was asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak about it</font>

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:12,360
occurs in a post quantum session that

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,980
doesn't look too good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so before we get</font>

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,789
into this let's forget about quantum

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,369
computers for a minute and let's admire

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,460
the awesomeness of elliptic curves in

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:28,799
cryptography yeah I know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still</font>

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,019
some haters out there so some people to

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,690
say what has elliptic curves ever done

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,449
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for those guys I have the</font>

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,160
following slide so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,980
awesome things we can do with a lip the

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,050
curve factoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ality proving we</font>

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,510
have simple and fast key exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,940
digital signatures so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecd edgy</font>

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,370
ecdsa<font color="#CCCCCC"> x 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 519 we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EDSA and even</font>

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,910
very modern things with funny names like

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,169
for Q and snore Q and all this comes

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,269
with very small and compact parameters

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,409
so yeah due to the availability of

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,570
generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks only and not to forget</font>

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,110
pairings right these are the only

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,580
practical multilinear maps we have they

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:24,689
brought a lot of nice applications and

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:27,539
all these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so</font>

26
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,880
unlike in the RSA setting in elliptic

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,619
curves really fix specific parameters so

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,079
we have a set of six specific curves you

29
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,490
might recognize some of those so here

30
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,158
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two sets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of curves that are widely</font>

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,960
used these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those two sets come</font>

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,470
from quite different selection processes

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,600
so the first ones are the nice curves

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:55,320
with all their P's and<font color="#CCCCCC"> l5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,130
typo and then the second set is curved

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,898
2519 and curve 448 those have been

37
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended by the IRT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for using TLS</font>

38
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,199
1.3 well yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some trust issues</font>

39
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,030
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those curves</font>

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,179
because there's a perception that these

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,280
four letter institutions were

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:25,090
inappropriately influenced by some

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:25,090
three-letter entities like NSA or<font color="#CCCCCC"> djb</font>

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,349
well anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the curves that</font>

45
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,450
many of you know is that are used in the

46
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,030
wild and now let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

47
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,569
something completely different so this

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">is some other elliptic curves and if you</font>

49
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:48,138
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this prime its first of</font>

50
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,690
all really large that's 751 bits and it

51
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,720
doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite like the primes we</font>

52
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,510
known from these other curves on the

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,959
previous slide so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not close to a</font>

54
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,599
power of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 like 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 519 it's actually</font>

55
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,260
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a power of 2 times the power of</font>

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:09,409
three and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this curve given here is</font>

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,810
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined over a prime field FP</font>

58
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,370
but we'll take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it over the</font>

59
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,190
quadratic extension field because

60
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,949
everything happens in that universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

61
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">FB squared that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is interesting for us so</font>

62
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:26,750
this curve is super singular and it's

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,760
group order is smooth you can see it

64
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,299
down there so over FB it's actually p

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,399
plus 1 and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> FB squared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P plus 1</font>

66
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:41,900
squared and this curve is really bad for

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,729
ECC right the main reasons are it's

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,829
super singular and it has a smooth group

69
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:49,819
order so the smooth to order makes sure

70
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:52,129
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily solve VLPs in any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subgroup</font>

71
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,638
and easily means in a matter of

72
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,560
milliseconds and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's super</font>

73
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,530
singular we have the way of pairing that

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually a multiplicative transfer of</font>

75
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,659
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete logarithm from the curve to</font>

76
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,299
finite field and in this case it's

77
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">really F P squared so the DLT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

78
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,729
becomes easier if you move it over to

79
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,899
this finite field so this curve fails

80
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:21,670
most criteria for being a secure curve

81
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,820
for traditional ECC but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we can</font>

82
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:32,710
use these other properties in a

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:35,890
different context so one of these

84
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:39,520
properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this curve has a</font>

85
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,110
really large number of subgroups so if

86
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,810
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the set of</font>

87
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,670
points which have a specific order so

88
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,500
all the orders that<font color="#E5E5E5"> divide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:53,860
372 this group of points can be

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,960
generated by two points and you can

91
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,150
easily generate any point in there by

92
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,430
taking scale a linear combinations with

93
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,419
these scalars<font color="#E5E5E5"> ma and na as shown here</font>

94
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,390
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you count the number of such sub</font>

95
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have full order you can</font>

96
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,409
easily generate those by making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

97
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,969
that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these coefficient is odd</font>

98
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,860
then you will see there are a lot of

99
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,380
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be 3 times 2 to the</font>

100
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,570
371 so we have a huge set of subgroups

101
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,150
and we might get the idea to take these

102
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,540
as secret keys right we can easily

103
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate them and you might notice i put</font>

104
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,280
the subscripts a here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

105
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,400
assign this storage and group to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice</font>

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,640
where LS now has this large set and can

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,219
choose secret points for her<font color="#E5E5E5"> subgroups</font>

108
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the same holds for the three</font>

109
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,910
power torsion just analogously the same

110
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,970
happens and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assign this to</font>

111
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">a Bob so Bob has this universe of</font>

112
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:59,470
subgroups here you can choose from and

113
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,050
now I have to at some point have to

114
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,000
mention the word exogenous right so what

115
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the connection there so from these</font>

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,670
subgroups we can come up with ISIL

117
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,159
journeys so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice ogenyi is</font>

118
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,860
actually just a map between two elliptic

119
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,560
curves it's a rational map so these are

120
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,150
the natural maps that exists between

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,190
elliptic curves and you can think of

122
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">those as just fractions of polynomials</font>

123
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,900
in the coefficients<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

124
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,450
mapping and there's an additional

125
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,448
condition here for being an ass ogenyi

126
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,150
which is that it is a group homomorphism

127
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,240
and then this correspondence between the

128
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,400
finite sub groups and a nice ogenyi is

129
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,039
given via the colonel so all these

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,219
elements that map 20 or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neutral</font>

131
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,949
element on the elliptic curve by this

132
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,719
map that's a subgroup and if you start

133
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,969
out with such a subgroup you will get

134
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:56,020
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sajan you from it with that</font>

135
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:59,529
Colonel actually there's a unique second

136
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,979
curve and a map between those up to

137
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:07,300
isomorphism and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to write</font>

138
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">this curve ii to as e 1 modulo GE modulo</font>

139
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,449
this subgroup and then it's something

140
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,159
that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a degree of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iso j'ni</font>

141
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,439
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost what you think it is</font>

142
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:19,719
sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the polynomials</font>

143
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,719
involved but in the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

144
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,839
interesting for us it's also the number

145
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elements in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this subgroup so what</font>

146
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,610
this gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is we start out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

147
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,279
huge set of subgroups and they had a

148
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,199
large order right so but what we get

149
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:39,610
from this is ice our journeys with a

150
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,259
very large degree and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what can we</font>

151
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,330
do with those so we can start on a

152
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:47,379
certain curve maybe the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

153
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:50,188
out with and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk it can map</font>

154
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,449
I so journeys to other curves and

155
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,819
actually what we're doing is we walk in

156
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,979
a certain graph and that is a super

157
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,409
singular lodging graph so the vertices

158
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,969
are all the curves that you can reach by

159
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:06,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sajan is from a certain starting point</font>

160
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:09,248
over FB squared and it turns out there

161
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,860
are quite a few so there are P over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

162
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:15,550
such curves to have we have also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

163
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,409
large set of eyes on this curve so they

164
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,499
all have the same group order so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

165
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,659
start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave you in the</font>

166
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,459
beginning then all these other curves we

167
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:28,360
end up on have the same structure they

168
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,969
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this torsion in the same way as</font>

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,409
starting curve and then the edges so now

170
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:37,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">I used my artistic skills to put some</font>

171
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,968
curves here think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these SB</font>

172
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,760
isomorphism classes and there are more

173
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,350
curves outside the slide and now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to draw edge</font>

175
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,240
but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to draw the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this high</font>

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,600
degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> isogen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is only prime decrease</font>

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,370
watch me so here are two I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sajan and it</font>

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,840
turns out this graph is<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected and</font>

179
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,150
three regular so every node has three

180
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,060
edges here there can be looped and

181
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,730
double edges but this is how a generic

182
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,250
part of that graph should look and then

183
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,500
if you take the three drab instead so

184
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,420
now if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not drawing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iso genus</font>

185
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,400
but we're drawing three I sajan<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it</font>

186
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,540
becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a for regular graph so you get</font>

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,470
more edges and you might notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

188
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,540
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were connected before now</font>

189
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:29,140
might not be connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things that</font>

190
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,050
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> close here might be far away in the</font>

191
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,660
three graphs so we have the same set of

192
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,579
nodes but we can walk through it in a

193
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:43,930
different way depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whether we</font>

194
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:45,550
take the two or the three exons<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

195
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,520
now I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

196
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,069
actually compute this stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

197
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,380
operation we want to use so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

198
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,000
choose these secret keys we want to come

199
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Genizah may want to</font>

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,140
actually compute the air so Janine's so

201
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,820
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are formulas we use formulas allow</font>

202
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,040
you to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the colonel subgroups and</font>

203
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,200
come up with the ice ogenyi come up with

204
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,709
formulas that allow you to map points

205
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,490
between curves the problem is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

206
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:20,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is proportional to the size of</font>

207
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the subgroup so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think back to</font>

208
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,959
these large subgroups there's no way we

209
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,590
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do this large ice watch me</font>

210
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,110
in one go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> luckily which shows the</font>

211
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,990
degree to be smooth so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

212
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,790
walk through the graph in little steps

213
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,930
for example in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I sajni graph we</font>

214
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,120
walk through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with two I sahaja knees</font>

215
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:45,880
so here's one example if we take this

216
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,320
one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> its order than we can be</font>

217
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,300
composed into 372 to ISO journeys and I

218
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,060
just wrote down the first one down there

219
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,819
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you take this point are</font>

220
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,420
not you do a scalar multiplication

221
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,700
by the factor 2 to the 371 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>

222
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you as a point of order to which</font>

223
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:10,510
lies in this kernel and itself generates

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,209
a small order to sub group which you can

225
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,330
use with the formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute this</font>

226
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,420
little first two eyes watching and then

227
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,310
you met everything so the new curve and

228
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,469
you keep on going so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one you'll</font>

229
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,209
take the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> are 12 a scalar</font>

230
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,130
multiplication to generate a point of

231
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:32,230
order 2 and then you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

232
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">step a little too isogen if i won so now</font>

233
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,450
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these operations we have all our</font>

234
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,280
secrets which are subgroups we get I

235
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sajan ease and we have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operation</font>

236
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we would</font>

237
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,689
try to come up with a diff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Helen key</font>

238
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,640
exchange from that so here's a

239
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:55,180
comparison between you've seen this

240
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,630
already in the previous talk recall of

241
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard diffie-hellman settings so</font>

242
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,850
the original one was integers modulo

243
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">prime your secrets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for exponents the</font>

244
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">computation is just an exponentiation</font>

245
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,490
and the hard problem is the discrete log

246
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,189
problem modulo P then on elliptic<font color="#CCCCCC"> curves</font>

247
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,400
the classical case you're working on a

248
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,610
group of points<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will scalar</font>

249
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,290
multiplication k times<font color="#CCCCCC"> P and again the</font>

250
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,400
discrete log on the elliptic curve but

251
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">now for the exogenous case we work on</font>

252
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,750
this class of I sergeants curves so this

253
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,310
graph and secrets are I sahaja knees and

254
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,130
the operation is taking a curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

255
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:44,109
applying yes fortunately coming up with

256
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:46,300
the second curve so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail</font>

257
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,720
here how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would that look so E is the</font>

258
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,990
curve from the start now Alice and Bob

259
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,230
both go ahead and select their secrets

260
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,260
subgroup by picking these scalars<font color="#E5E5E5"> m and</font>

261
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,620
n in their respective cases and then

262
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,830
just doing what I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just walk to</font>

263
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,059
the other curve in the graph now these

264
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,429
red

265
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:11,439
curves they are the public keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

266
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:15,779
public information they sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the</font>

267
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">other party and now they somehow need to</font>

268
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:22,839
complete this diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> we sort of need to</font>

269
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:26,649
arrive at a common curve that we can

270
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,499
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shared key and for this to</font>

271
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,139
be possible in this setting we need some

272
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:35,889
more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have to expand</font>

273
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:38,559
the public keys by the images of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

274
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:42,519
generator points under the secret I

275
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:48,358
sajni so what Ellis will do she will

276
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:51,989
send Phi a of PB and Phi a of QB as well

277
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:55,539
so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that so what Bob can do now is</font>

278
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:58,959
compute the image of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his secret point</font>

279
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:03,519
are under Alice's secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> lies urgently</font>

280
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:06,638
by just doing the same operation he did

281
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with are now on these images</font>

282
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,539
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a group homomorphism</font>

283
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,998
this will be the image of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret</font>

284
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:16,479
point so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a way to make sure</font>

285
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:20,259
that the similar operation now can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

286
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:23,649
done on Alice's public key right and

287
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:29,279
vice versa so now we can arrive<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font>

288
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,279
shared secret curve emod<font color="#E5E5E5"> our command</font>

289
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:36,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so how let's start thinking about</font>

290
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:39,759
parameters and sizes and timings so how

291
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:43,949
large are these keys they can actually

292
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:47,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">be represented with just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 64 points</font>

293
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:52,478
so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could take three x</font>

294
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:54,969
coordinates over FB squared so basically

295
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:57,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">three F P squared elements will allow</font>

296
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:59,679
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate to represent this and</font>

297
00:14:57,219 --> 00:15:02,769
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 564 bit so compared to what we</font>

298
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:05,199
saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous talk and even the</font>

299
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,239
one before this is still quite a bit

300
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">smaller than the lettuce based schemes</font>

301
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:13,089
even the ring learning with arrows which

302
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:16,478
head around to kilobytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights /</font>

303
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:19,209
direction or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new ones can create</font>

304
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,240
introduced shorter still one kill

305
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:24,309
bye<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so it's really really</font>

306
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,730
small but unfortunately I have to

307
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:32,589
disappoint you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alera no update it's</font>

308
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:36,939
still as low as it was so these are

309
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:38,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">timings in millions of cycles so the</font>

310
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:43,179
total is around<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty six milliseconds</font>

311
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:46,569
on this machine and yeah it is a bit

312
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:49,059
slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so compared to the soletta</font>

313
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:51,939
stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not competitive</font>

314
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,469
yet if you really need the size if you

315
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:56,469
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have small things then</font>

316
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be an option but hopefully</font>

317
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,559
people can speed this up<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you want</font>

318
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the code we have we have</font>

319
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,649
released the code under the link shown

320
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:14,290
here and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take it and play</font>

321
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">around so what about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security yeah</font>

322
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,610
there's a whole bunch of problems

323
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,759
related to this key exchange as usual I

324
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,129
just put the overarching super singular

325
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,329
I certainly problem here that

326
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:29,259
corresponds to the discrete log problem

327
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:33,519
for the other cases so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

328
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:36,009
you're given two curves u1 and u2 over

329
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,860
FB squares and you know there's a nice

330
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,949
ogenyi between them of a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed</font>

331
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,709
and smooth degree and now giving those

332
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:50,290
two curves together with two points and

333
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:55,929
their images find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I so Janine so in</font>

334
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:58,929
terms of attacks so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so this</font>

335
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very general I sajni</font>

336
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:04,059
problem right if you would take two

337
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,389
random curves in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that class you're not</font>

338
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:10,329
guaranteed that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected by a</font>

339
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,669
progeny of this specific degree so

340
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,668
that's an additional condition here and

341
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:18,059
that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> also because this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit</font>

342
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,980
shorter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you would usually expect</font>

343
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,180
this means that the best attacks we know

344
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,970
are actually attacks

345
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,410
by a standard generic claw finding

346
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,370
algorithm so you would start from both

347
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,140
ends build up trees of I sahaja Yogi's

348
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,360
and then find a match in the middle

349
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and it turns out the other</font>

350
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:43,159
classical complexity is o of P<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to</font>

351
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:47,840
the one-fourth and the quantum attack is

352
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:52,460
of pizzas 16 and for these these attacks

353
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,159
these algorithms are optimal so we think

354
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:02,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has post quantum security roughly</font>

355
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:04,550
125 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so we do have this</font>

356
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,090
key exchange now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which produces</font>

357
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,610
pretty small public keys but it's slow

358
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:15,560
so let's make the keys even smaller and

359
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:18,139
the protocol even<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do</font>

360
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,070
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> two keys to compress them even</font>

361
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:25,070
further and this relates to what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

362
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,379
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of the first few slides that</font>

363
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,200
this curve is actually really bad for

364
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,940
traditional ECC because it has the LPS

365
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,980
can be solved easily and it has a

366
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,130
pairing and now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use these</font>

367
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in a constructive way namely it</font>

368
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,570
is way better to represent points not by

369
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,889
their coordinates but by these scalars

370
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were used to generate them or in</font>

371
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,640
this case I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will be mapped to</font>

372
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,170
this curve so they weren't generated but

373
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,150
we can they are representable by the two

374
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,570
scalars in uncertain basis of the

375
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,870
torsion group right but for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

376
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve this Creed logs but we can do</font>

377
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,250
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in milliseconds so we can actually</font>

378
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just solve them and come up with these</font>

379
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,130
scalars so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean as I</font>

380
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned the original public key is</font>

381
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:19,850
three FB squared elements which is six

382
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:25,370
log P bits and that was the number we

383
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:28,610
saw 5 64 bytes but now we can replace

384
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:33,219
both of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> points by their scalars in</font>

385
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:35,990
the decomposition<font color="#CCCCCC"> by these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete logs</font>

386
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,870
and we can even normalize by one so

387
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,840
there's definitely

388
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,629
one among the four that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be inverted</font>

389
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:46,080
modulo<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid</font>

390
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:50,820
of one and only have three elements of

391
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:54,300
size 2 to the 372 so that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

392
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,350
7 over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P n which is 330 bytes in</font>

393
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:01,139
the setting i showed so what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

394
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,600
to do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to happen so we get this</font>

395
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,150
public key these points first of all

396
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,070
because this curve we're working on is a

397
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">random curve we just came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with during</font>

398
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key exchange right so we chose this</font>

399
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,150
path we walk there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have the</font>

400
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,120
curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> equation now we first need to come</font>

401
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,920
up with a basis for the torsion group so

402
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to deterministic Lee compute a</font>

403
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,410
basis because the person who will

404
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,770
decompress will need to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

405
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:32,550
basis and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even use the</font>

406
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,610
pairings we map<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything over to the</font>

407
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,559
finite field<font color="#E5E5E5"> F P squared and then we can</font>

408
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,600
simultaneously solve these<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete logs</font>

409
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:45,990
for these coefficients and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

410
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:50,010
well it is fast but it costs as much as

411
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:57,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">about one whole key exchange so pretty</font>

412
00:20:50,010 --> 00:21:01,170
slow in<font color="#E5E5E5"> total all right the last thing</font>

413
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:04,160
I'd like to mention is there's a problem

414
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:07,830
if you want to use this in a static

415
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:11,220
setting so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar problems</font>

416
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,290
for the lattice based schemes it seems

417
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if somehow inherent to some of</font>

418
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:19,800
these post quantum candidates and here

419
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:23,940
in the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sajni setting it has to do with</font>

420
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,428
these points we give out actually so

421
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,820
assume we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slightly simplified</font>

422
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:35,870
setting here the first scalar is one in

423
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:39,750
Alice's public key staticky secret and

424
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,889
then imagine Bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Alice to this</font>

425
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,600
protocol and Bob behaves honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

426
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,610
a certain point when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has to send his</font>

427
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,490
public key

428
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,309
so he computes these images of Alice's

429
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,290
points but he doesn't send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

430
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:57,170
public key he slightly modified the

431
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:01,250
second point by adding this multiple of

432
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:03,049
the first point and then he goes on and

433
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,940
does the rest of the protocol honestly

434
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:09,020
so he will come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the honest</font>

435
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:12,110
shared secret in the end which is really

436
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the curve that comes from the subgroup</font>

437
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,809
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left down here but Ellis when she</font>

438
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,780
uses the public key that Bob Center she

439
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,610
will compute the point on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right so</font>

440
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,460
she has this additional term in there

441
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,860
and it turns out that those two groups

442
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:32,419
are the same exactly when the least

443
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,219
significant bit of na is<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so Bob now</font>

444
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,500
can use Ellis as an Oracle you can try

445
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,169
to connect if you can if the connection

446
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,750
works then the bit must have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

447
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:47,330
it's not it was one so yeah this allows

448
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,710
Bob to just get at the least significant

449
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,070
bit and there's a slightly more

450
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:58,419
complicated way but as simple to get the

451
00:22:52,070 --> 00:23:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">other bits so with a sort of fear and</font>

452
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:04,010
connections here Bob can reconstruct

453
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,010
Alice's secret key there is a

454
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,919
countermeasure to this but the

455
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,440
countermeasure is basically the fujisaki

456
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okamoto transform which means Alice</font>

457
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,510
would have to recompute everything that

458
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,480
bought it and the cost for that would be

459
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than to do do an ephemeral key</font>

460
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,049
exchange in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

461
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:30,080
doesn't really make sense to do static

462
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:33,950
here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

463
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,929
with in the interest of keeping elliptic

464
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,340
curves in cryptography please

465
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,490
helped by taking another look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

466
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">fortunately based crypto yeah so crypt</font>

467
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:49,700
analysis is a bit understudied I think

468
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:55,040
so we need people that really want to

469
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:57,470
break this and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to speed</font>

470
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,120
it up it is too slow as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem so</font>

471
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,720
which would need an order or two of

472
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,090
magnitude to get there and then there

473
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,100
are some open problems like public key

474
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:13,100
validation that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow the aesthetic</font>

475
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,709
attacks and in terms of signatures the

476
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,990
only thing we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is applying</font>

477
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,910
the phe- transformed to an

478
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:25,340
identification protocol and it's quite

479
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">inefficient so this talk was mainly</font>

480
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:32,600
about people other people's work so I

481
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,840
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put the most immediate references</font>

482
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,270
here those are a good start to find all

483
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,080
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were involved in all</font>

484
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:48,670
this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm done</font>

485
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,669
[Applause]

486
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions we have time</font>

487
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,970
for a poor-spirited tops or don't I ask

488
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a question so right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a</font>

489
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,559
generation of elliptic curves called

490
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,180
higher genius curves I<font color="#E5E5E5"> precise now you</font>

491
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,129
know hyper elliptic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> such how do</font>

492
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,040
these things behave in those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

493
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:18,910
environment all very much more

494
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:20,680
complicated stay away<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

495
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,540
good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but this is a very</font>

496
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,960
reasonable to survival alternatives or

497
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:29,330
bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraints environment quick</font>

498
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's think Michael</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>
