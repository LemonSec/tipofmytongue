<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i'm going to talk about internet</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,680
scale consensus the disjoint work with

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,269
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edo been tough and rough I'll pass</font>

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay some of you may remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that being</font>

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,150

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,550
Foundation and if you were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,510
submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proposal back in July and sorry</font>

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,360
you had to wait and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I wouldn't</font>

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">be too upset if I'm and you tell me I</font>

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,170
cannot fly and if you tell me I cannot

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,129
do science I reassure your ugly very

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,370
cranky okay the moral of the story is

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,339
that we need two things replication and

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,250
robustness okay so this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea but it is precisely this very</font>

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,000
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> birth to an entire</font>

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,900
research area called distributed systems

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,060
and there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years of wonderful</font>

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,729
research and development in this area ok

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,369
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> distributive systems we care about</font>

27
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,710
a very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction called a</font>

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,470
state machine replication and this is

29
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">also known as linearly ordered lock or</font>

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,530
consensus so what's stainless your

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,780
application let's consider a typical

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,549
scenario and suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have google</font>

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,829
google wallet is the mission critical

34
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,960
application and suppose they want to

35
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,298
replicate their servers and this has to

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,798
be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea because if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,079
money in<font color="#E5E5E5"> google wallet you don't want to</font>

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,170
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money if the server goes down</font>

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you imagine a la</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vie</font>

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,600
servers they want to agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a linearly</font>

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,460
ordered log of transaction and there are

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,408
two important security properties that

43
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,679
we care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and consistency</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

44
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,799
lifeless a consistency said that the

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,640
honest notes must agree on with the log

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,149
is and life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that's an if a</font>

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,770
client submits a transaction then this

48
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,910
transaction should appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

49
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:21,350
servers locks

50
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:23,400
very quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this nice seat</font>

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,890
deceptively simple you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font>

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,990
think this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

53
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,410
indeed the problem is somewhat trivial

54
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,390
if all these servers are understand

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,859
correctly following the protocol but the

56
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,809
issue is that if some of these servers

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,420
are compromised and compromise servers

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,420
for instance can be behaving a betrayal

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,339
a then it turns out the the problem is

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non-trivial okay and when we</font>

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,260
traditionally when we think about

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,299
consensus and this is what I talked

63
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of the typical scenario</font>

64
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,990
that we think about and the deployment

65
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,209
is typically within a single

66
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,700
organization we have a relatively

67
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,380
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter deployment and the</font>

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,810
nodes are interconnected with facts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,420
local area network and because these

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,030
notes belong to the same organization we

71
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,589
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are mutually trustful</font>

72
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then in the year one after</font>

73
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin there was Genesis and this kind</font>

74
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,209
of this was really exciting development

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,060
because it opened a new chapter for

76
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,860
distributed consensus and it's amazing

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,430
because now we can do internet scale

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,840
consensus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet scale</font>

79

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,459
internet you know we may have thousands

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and millions of notes and the notes may</font>

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,350
sometimes have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been our connections and</font>

84
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,738
some notes may have outages and so

85
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,560
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more unpredictability and</font>

86
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,840
also you know on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet everyone's</font>

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,670
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of acting selfishly so we assume</font>

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the notes are mutually distract for</font>

89
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,238
and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these great new challenges I</font>

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk quite frequently with people in the</font>

91
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,880
cryptocurrency community and it seems

92
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,399
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of and beliefs that</font>

93
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,799
these classical consensus protocols

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,660
aren't a great fit for this internet

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,459
scale deployment and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

96
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,399
that is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not quote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unquote</font>

97
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,560
robust enough so this intuition making

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,190
very very nice but on the other hand is

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">also somewhat and</font>

100
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm satisfying because for instance it

101
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,780
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice and exactly what Robotnik</font>

102
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,190
means what new robot miss properties are

103
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,440
we looking for for internet cell

104
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,990
deployment and only where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can only</font>

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,050
when we can answer this question can we

106
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,270
proceed to an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> the later catching</font>

107
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,770
such as you know why aren't traditional

108
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,719
protocols robust enough and how can we

109
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:52,930
actually achieve robustness okay and so

110
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,330
I'm going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and try to answer</font>

111
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,060
these questions and maybe at least give

112
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,940
a partial answer to disgusting and oh

113
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,190
and before that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say and you</font>

114
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,750
know I actually I asked the various

115
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,270
people in the cryptocurrency community

116
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,680
what they mean by robustness but it

117
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,210
turns out to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon the community</font>

118
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,010
doesn't actually have a clear way of

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,989
articulating what kind of properties

120
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,710
they are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and interestingly</font>

121
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">like in this cryptocurrency community</font>

122
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the interesting phenomena is</font>

123
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,600
that the scientific understanding kind

124
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,770
of is lagging behind to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interior co</font>

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,450
success and this reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of this</font>

126
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,180
interesting and saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my my</font>

127
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,700
colleague and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concierge he used to</font>

128
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the fifth research</font>

129
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,039
community a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequent question you'd</font>

130
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,710
act other<font color="#E5E5E5"> researchers is what's the time</font>

131
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,350
from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> research paper to real-world</font>

132
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,289
deployment ok so for classical

133
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,180
technologies like you'd expect an answer

134
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,490
let's say within between five years to

135
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,560
10 years and before something like

136
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,310
cryptocurrency like in this area the

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,650
answer to disgusting is negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 month</font>

138
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and so let's begin with the most</font>

139
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,370
basic question what is robot news I'm

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,919
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make an analogy we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

141
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,860
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation presidential election</font>

142
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,979
what happens when you ask a 300 million

143
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to vote ok so what's going to</font>

144
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen is that only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 116 million of them</font>

145
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,460
will show up and so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hope for</font>

146
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,340
is that you know perhaps amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

147
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,320
people who actually do show up maybe we

148
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,510
can hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51-percent of them are</font>

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,800
honest because otherwise we cannot

150
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,400
really predict the outcome of the

151
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
election and

152
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,450
and we can kind of think of and

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,849
consensus in you know very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the same</font>

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">way and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to cut this the sleepy</font>

155

156
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">assume that the note and are either</font>

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,969
sleeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means that they are</font>

158
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,770
offline or they're awake which means

159
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're online and actively</font>

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,020
participating in the protocol so sleepy

for instance can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of and bad</font>

162
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,789
network connection maybe the notes have

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,220
temporary outages and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth and</font>

164
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,020
also importantly the state status of

165
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,750
each node can change like maybe

166
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,370
unnoticed and has an outage but later it

167
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,290
recovers from the outage when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prince</font>

countries is the first two are pretty

173
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,240
standard the malicious nodes can behave

174
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,030
arbitrarily and in particular our

175
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,590
adversary and like then and can be very

176
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">very smart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attending you know he can't</font>

deviation from the protocol in very

178
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,430
smart ways perhaps to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> divert to the</font>

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,950
opinions of the unacknowledged<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

182
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,280
other hand we are also going to assume

183
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:55,180
that and the notes who actually are

184
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,789
online they have and they can receive

185
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,620
messages relatively quickly they may

186
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,790
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages out of order but they</font>

187
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,890
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive some relatively</font>

188
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,210
quickly because if not we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

189
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,260
to treat these notes as being offline

190
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:10,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so a very natural question we may</font>

191
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,890
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> act in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setting is can we</font>

192
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:17,110
and achieve consensus assuming that

193
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who actually show up 51</font>

194
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:26,440

195
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,760
before and telling you the answer to

196
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,020
this question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this is</font>

197
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,909
actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best you can hope for</font>

198
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,740
because we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lower bound</font>

199
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,630
showing that is among the people who

200
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,250
show up only like less than sixty

201
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,870
percent i understand you can now hope to

202
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach consensus i'm not going to explain</font>

203
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lower bound and and also here are</font>

204
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,700
some and some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually</font>

205
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,110
mean when i asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question so we</font>

206
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,750
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to assume that the protocol</font>

207
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,160
cannot

208
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,040
ticipate how many people are going to

209
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,540
shop it could be like maybe thirty

210
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,060
percent will show up there could be one

211
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,130
percent will shop and maybe I

212
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,540
anticipated a 34-10 low shot burgundy

213
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,770
and only one person showed up and I

214
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,780
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case that the people</font>

215
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ninety-nine percent of people who</font>

216
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,610
didn't show up they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hamper</font>

217
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,420
the progress of the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

218
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:17,090
do show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so awesome maybe in the</font>

219
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,430
beginning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of note that</font>

220
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,290
sleeping but maybe later they they wake

221
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,339
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at the moment they wake up they</font>

222
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,230
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive other pending</font>

223
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,420
messages and we want to say that for

224
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,880
those notes that wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> up they are going</font>

225
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make progress and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know start to</font>

226
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,939
agree with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the network okay</font>

227
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,680
so you think like this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

228
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,240
natural questioning and with 30 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

229
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,430
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> on distributed systems we would</font>

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,050
have after discussion by now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

231
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,420
answer actually may surprise you because

232
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,930
it turns out that our classical for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,569
cost breakdown in this model and we can

234
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually even say something something</font>

235
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,580
stronger because even<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we are</font>

236
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,050
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume that amount of people</font>

237
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,120
who show up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

238
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,120
them are honest and this is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

239
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,400
enough because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even even when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 99% of</font>

240
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,540
them are honest we still cannot none of

241
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,689
the practical for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost we will</font>

242
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually work okay so this seems like a</font>

243
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,880
very strong claim that i'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

244
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,459
going to explain very quickly and why

245
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,130
this is the case it turns out that for

246
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,050
practical context protocols and roughly

247
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,000
speaking and there are two broad classes

248
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,920
and synchronous protocols and

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,720
asynchronous total cost in the

250
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,670
synchronous model we typically assume

251
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,740
that the messages sense will be

252
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,199
delivered immediately whereas in the

253
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,180
asynchronous model and the adversary can

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,310
delay angry other messages arbitrarily

255
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the delay can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> independent and</font>

256
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:44,119
unknown<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the protocol and upfront so</font>

257
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we know a lot about both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> models and</font>

258
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,170
there have been many protocols proposed

259
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,600
in the past that solve the consensus

260
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,790
protocols solve the consensus<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in</font>

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,370
these settings so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just have to</font>

262
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince you why and each class of</font>

263
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,209
protocols and do not work it's

264
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively easy to see why I think when</font>

265
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,109
it's protocol trail because and in our

266
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,140
model remember we allow notes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

267
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleep</font>

268
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,939
and when they wake up they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

269
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,130
receive the pending messages so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

270
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,560
a way for for you to break the synchrony

271
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,240
assumption basically messages and not

272
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,280
necessarily received immediately and

273
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,890
obviously in such a model at all of the

274
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,329
synchronous protocol students don't work

275
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and practice the more interesting</font>

276
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,970
question to ask why the even the eighth

277
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,060
in clinical its protocol don't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

278
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,330
so here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a practical asynchronous</font>

279
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,849
model if a lot goes to sleep we are

280
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to pessimistically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treat it as</font>

281
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,890
being corrupt so<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine you have an</font>

282
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,280
asynchronous protocol that can tolerate

283
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,900
and let me up to win third corruption

284
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,449
okay what's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen is let's say</font>

285
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,270
it turns out only<font color="#E5E5E5"> what one percent of</font>

286
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,650
people showed up and in this case the

287
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,060
protocol is going to treat like

288
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,030
ninety-nine percent of the notes as

289
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,880
being corrupt and what's going to happen

290
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:03,240
is like the notes are going to kind of

291
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,550
wait to collect let's say click<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote</font>

292
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,840
from two-thirds of the people but in

293
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,099
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one percent of the people</font>

294
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,920
showed up so you're never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

295
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,310
collect enough most votes and therefore

296
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,829
the protocol gets stuck ok so the

297
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">fundamental problem here is that as I</font>

298
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,920
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot anticipate how many</font>

299
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,440
people are going to show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I've</font>

300
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,900
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked about and what I mean by</font>

301
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,080
robot news and why classical protocols

302
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,180
well I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a remark you know</font>

303
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,670
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only talked about really one aspect</font>

304
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,170
of robustness and robustness can mean

305
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,569
many other things like for instance for

306
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">in particularly interests as fact is</font>

307
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,410
incentive compatibility this is

308
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,850
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very very important in</font>

309
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet scale deployment but</font>

310
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,410
perhaps of less concern you know in this

311
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,110
classical setting where you have a

312
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">single organization but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this can't be at</font>

313
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,250
our topic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate talk we also</font>

314
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,170
have other works such as the fruit<font color="#CCCCCC"> chain</font>

315
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,990
paper that addresses and the incentive

316
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,550
compatibility issue and for the purpose

317
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk we are going to turn our</font>

318
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,380

319
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,849
issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

320
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,430
can't design probably take your

protocols that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your robot is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

322
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,420
and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

323
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,579
and let's turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the people and</font>

324
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,290
hear what the people have to say you

325
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:24,019
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

326
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:28,639
veterans because Nakamoto blasting

327
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:30,800
protocol is exceptionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> robot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

328
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,180
in fact it's actually quite amazing if

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
you think about it because the Bitcoin

330
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,290
protocol has been up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> running and</font>

331
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,959
pretty much without interruption for the

332
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,360
past eight years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this reason</font>

333
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,758
people refer to Bitcoin as the honey

334
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,319
badger<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money and honey badger as we</font>

335
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:52,339
all know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very robust animal okay</font>

336
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:54,560
and in fact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are right because</font>

337
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can actually formally prove that the</font>

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,638
natural moto<font color="#CCCCCC"> bludgeon protocol let's</font>

339
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,579
give you and consensus in the 3d model

340
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,060
and in fact our<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper kind of implies</font>

341
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:08,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to explain why and</font>

342
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,239
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good but the biggest drawback</font>

343
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,430
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin as we all know is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

344
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,279
enormously ways for the electricity

345
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,839
consumed by bitcoin is<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater than the</font>

346
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,089
largest nuclear plant in the United

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,040
States which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more than ten percent of</font>

all of the solar power<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States</font>

349
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so therefore we want to ask the</font>

350
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,699
following question can we achieve the

351
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,630
robustness properties of Nakamoto

352
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:37,069
consensus but you know not have to pay

353
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:39,769
the expensive proof of work how can we

354
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:42,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this well let's first try the most</font>

355
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,750
natural idea right let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick nakamoto's</font>

356
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,500
block chain and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to just remove</font>

357
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,600
the proof<font color="#CCCCCC"> award but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the challenge</font>

358
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,209
here is how you can do this in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

359
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,430
that doesn't break security<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm going</font>

360
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,439
to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do this but in order</font>

361
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,149
to tell you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I'm going to</font>

362
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:01,310
first explain how my cameltoe<font color="#CCCCCC"> block</font>

363
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:03,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">chain works and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

364
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,579
relatively quickly because maybe many of

365
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,740
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already very familiar with</font>

366
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,439
Nakamoto blotching what is the blocking

367
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a chain of blocks and and how do we</font>

368
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">build a blocking imagine we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

369
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,880
chain and we want to extend the next

370
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">block so what do we do we take a bunch</font>

371
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,850
of transactions Down Yonder confirms

372
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,189
maybe one of the transaction is that

373
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:27,160
balance to pay you laying<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 declines</font>

374
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe to purchase Elaine's car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

375
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:31,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to take a hash function and</font>

376
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,599
I'm going to hatch the following things

377
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,579
and this blue guy is the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

378
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,199
that I want to expense and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

379
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,689
take the the transactions I want to

380
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,979
confirm and also a puzzle solution I'm

381
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hash all of these things</font>

382
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,709
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome is less than</font>

383
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:50,860
a difficulty parameter D then I say that

384
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have funds in a solution okay so the</font>

385
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,120
screen guy is called the patio solution

386
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:58,649
and whenever I find a path of solution

387
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
i'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mine the next block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

388
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,579
when we survive bitcoin is

389
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,889
computationally expensive is none

390
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,060
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we assume that the let's let's</font>

391
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,880
assume the hash function<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a random</font>

392
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oracle and in order for me to find a</font>

393
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,199
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to try many different</font>

394
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:15,970
and pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the jigsaw puzzle until</font>

395
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:22,389
you know I can find one that satisfies

396
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,880
this inequality<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it's very</font>

397
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:26,620
important that the honest notes are

398
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,350
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in the longest chain if</font>

399
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see a multiple Forks and the reason</font>

400
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:35,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">being that imagines an hour adversary</font>

401
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,819
and she purchases the car from from

402
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,560
Elaine he<font color="#CCCCCC"> receives the car and now he</font>

403
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:40,750
wants to erase this transaction so he

404
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,489
can double spend this money and how to

405
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,470
stand to this so if you can basically

406
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,279
mind a longer chain than the main chain

407
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,399
and but the intuition is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

408
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,100
transaction is very deep enough in the

409
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,290
blocking then San can not successfully

410
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,050
mine a longer chain unless he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the</font>

411
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of the hash power and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theme</font>

412
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,589
to intuition has been formalized singing

413
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,809
and some earlier works for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

414
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,880
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very elegant workup great</font>

415
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,879
career at all and also packed<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font>

416
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:16,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and so now we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the Nakamoto</font>

417
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:21,490
blotching works and let's try to remove

418
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:24,309
the proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work okay so one thing that</font>

419
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,650
we observe is that we can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

420
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,049
Nakamoto blotching as performing leader

421
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,350
election whenever you successfully find

422
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,179
the total solution you're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

423
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,320
leader and you get to propose next batch

424
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:40,090
charged with batch of transactions okay

425
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,870
and our key idea here is that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

426
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,260
restrict the puzzle

427
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,719
space so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> implies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nakamoto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blocking</font>

428
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,370
the notes have to try many different

429
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,530
package solutions but what if let's say

430
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,600
you know that there are so many total

431
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:59,320
solutions to try and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font>

432
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:01,419
to work so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for the time</font>

433
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,179
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> for simplicity let's consider a</font>

434
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,220
permission setting meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

435
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,590
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> which notes are participating in</font>

436
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,050
the protocol and every note a note the

437
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,520
public keys of every other node and the

438
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,350
later in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk i'm going to remark</font>

439
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,300
how to take this permission protocol and

440
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:22,000
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> permission list by doing proof</font>

441
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:24,760
of stake<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so remember that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

442
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,679
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nakamoto block chain and people have</font>

443
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work very hard but let's restrict the</font>

444
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,030
patio space and how do we do this and

445
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine the notes are weakly</font>

446
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,389
synchronized everyone has like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> week</font>

447
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">play synchronous I mean they have a</font>

448
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,880
weekly synchronized clock okay let's and

449
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,840
let's say now in every time step and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan</font>

450
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,970
is going to tan hash his name

451
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,470
concatenated with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current time and</font>

452
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,140
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome is less than the</font>

453
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,200
difficulty diameter then is elected the

454
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,890
leader in this round in the time step

455
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,809
and if you use the leader she can and

456
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,330
take the block he wants to expand you

457
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,770
can take a batch of transactions you can

458
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,309
also take the current time step and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

459
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign all of these things and</font>

460
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:11,080
this allows them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mine the next block</font>

461
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,520
and everyone can verify you know that

462
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,040
the block is correctly formed by

463
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,559
checking that van is indeed the leader

464
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,330
in the time step and that the block is

465
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:24,160
correctly signed by dense public key

466
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this seems like a very natural</font>

467
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:31,270
idea but but the question is whether

468
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:34,179
this protocol is secure okay well it

469
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,600
turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the answer is no this protocol</font>

470
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:39,370
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't work and and</font>

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,919
fundamentally because the ever so you

472
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,149
can and has a lot of advantage in

473
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,220
comparison with the honest notes like

474
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,260
for instance when the honest notes get

475
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,170
elected she's going to sign exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

476
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,590
block but when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advocate selected you</font>

477
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,500
can find many blocks and also the honest

478
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">nodes are only going to</font>

479
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,350
minding the presence they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

480
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the current time step and try to</font>

481
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,280
hash it whereas the adversary can take

482
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,500
future time steps and hash you know as

483
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,210
many times as you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in order</font>

484
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,700
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol secure we have to</font>

485
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,010
and kind of constrain the ways in which

486
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,250
the adversary can behave<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here here</font>

487
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,470
are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas let's let's say and</font>

488
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:18,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time stamps in the block have to</font>

489
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,330
strictly increase and let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also require</font>

490
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,520
that the honest notes will reject any

491
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,669
block chain where the block at the

492
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,590
future time stamp so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do this then</font>

493
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,780
you can see you know when we ever to get

494
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,580
elected<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's not able to sign many</font>

495
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,800
blocks because the time stamps have to

496
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,780
strictly increase and also the adversary

497
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,139
can't just take a future<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and time</font>

498
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,960
step and try to hash it ok so there's

499
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:46,880
another question is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this done fix</font>

500
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,230
protocol and now secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well it turns</font>

501
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,580
out this is kind of like a trick

502
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,230
question because the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

503
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,620
editing these two chirpers it's

504
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,240
non-trivial to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and what's the</font>

505
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,219
most non trivial<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't have time to</font>

506
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,330
explain the details here and but

507
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:04,100
essentially in in this protocol there

508
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,899
are ways that the adversary can attack

509
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,100
the systems that was previously not

510
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,360
possible in the Nakamoto block chain and

511
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,639
therefore because of this reason the

512
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,270
previous Nakamoto and<font color="#E5E5E5"> block chain</font>

513
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,620
analysis and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> failed to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font>

514
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,240
therefore in order for us to prove this

515
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,850
protocol secure we have to do much more

516
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,620
work i will have time to cover the proof

517
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,139
if you are interested you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read our</font>

518
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,659
paper we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are going to release a</font>

519
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,830
new version and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon and in the</font>

520
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,240
paper we also have some additional

521
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,590
results like we can weaken the

522
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,780
assumption by removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the random Oracle</font>

523
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,090
and we can achieve adaptive security

524
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,320
through complexity leveraging well it

525
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case even</font>

526
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,159
completely leveraging is non-trivial and

527
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,110
I won't go into more details and I

528
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,540
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say so our protocol is called</font>

529
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,879
sleepy consensus and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

530
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,250
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one particularly attractive</font>

531
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,260
application of sleepy consensus is for a

532
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,700
consortium blockchain what is the

533
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,110
construction blocking this is something

534
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the bank's really want like they</font>

535
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,850
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a distributed ledger and</font>

536
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,190
Lady each bank will contribute some

537
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,610
consensus notes and this will allow them

538
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,980
to do

539
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,840
much faster interbank settlement<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

540
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,460
and there are a bunch of projects and

541
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,189
companies in a cryptocurrency space that

542
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,440
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help the bank's build</font>

543
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,860
consultant blocking and what's nice

544
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,410
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sleepy in the setting is that</font>

545
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,240
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our ability to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

546
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,280
sleepiness you get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

547
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,290
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of for free like you</font>

548
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,270
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to reconfigure the system</font>

549
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,909
it's very easy to recover from<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts</font>

550
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,100
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the construction</font>

551
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:39,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">blocking setting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in minutes and the</font>

552
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,928
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have to administer their</font>

553
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,700
notes in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized fashion like it</font>

554
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,010
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really nice if let's say I'm a</font>

555
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,350
bank and I can kind of spawn some

556
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,879
replicas and maybe reboot my machines

557
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,040
without having to coordinate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

558
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,290
banks so this protocol will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

559
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,418
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

560
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,480
applying our protocol like will be very

561
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:02,510
happy to talk to you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to</font>

562
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,150
quickly summarize I've talked about how

563
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,520
to take the Nakamoto Black team protocol

564
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,580
and how to remove the proof of work in a

565
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,309
secure way such that we get an instance

566
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,540
of permission consensus and I think

567
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,549
what's interesting is that we can

568
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,639
achieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> these new robots with properties</font>

569
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">doubts that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not possible with these</font>

570
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,320
classical consensus protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

571
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,730
it would also be nice like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

572
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,220
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> permission this protocol as</font>

573
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:32,090
well and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do this we can</font>

574
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:34,280
take sleepy and recast it to the

575
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,918
permission is setting by doing proof of

576
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,129

577
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,690
know improve of work the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rap idea is</font>

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your voting power it is</font>

579
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,480
proportional to your computational power

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,370
but whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Traverse take your voting</font>

581
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,020
power is roughly speaking proportional

582
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:56,479
to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stake in the system ok so we</font>

583
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,940
also have a paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and the proof of</font>

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:08,510
pretty soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to conclude we've</font>

588
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,760
come a really long way we've you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,549
that's why you should become our partner

questions that we don't understand that

612
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,690
then the ones that we understand so we

613
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,090
need new theoretical frameworks to kind

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze and written about these</font>

615

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,760
secure protocol design and

617
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,620

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said in this area the time from</font>

your research<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper to deployment is</font>

628
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,870
negative six months so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to</font>

629
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,399
worry about you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a long</font>

630
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,290
time for your research to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make real</font>

[Applause]

633
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:03,059
right so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time for questions</font>

634
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,700
are at least two questions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

635
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:08,309
okay um can I just ask quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

636
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,960
said that your fix involves time

637
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,700
stamping stuff and basically saying that

638
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,920
people don't accept time stamps in the

639
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">future but how does can you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just give a</font>

640
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,370
hint of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works in a fully</font>

641
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,080
asynchronous setting because surely

642
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would disagree about when the</font>

643
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,220
future is and so the synchrony there are

644
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,809
two notions of synchrony<font color="#E5E5E5"> winners clock</font>

645
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,610
synchrony and the other is now extinct

646
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:28,620
ranee so in this case we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming</font>

647
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the clock the clock that we click</font>

648
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,729
synchronize so like your clock is

649
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,340
relatively close to mine like in the

650
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">first day there was a very nice cock on</font>

651
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,790
and NCP<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is also the 25th you</font>

652
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,220
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cops confirm you can be achieved</font>

653
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:48,870
through things like MTP protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

654
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">my talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in you showed the original in</font>

655
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,669
the Nakamoto chain you have the hash

656
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">function of the last block and the coins</font>

657
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:59,309
and the puzzle solution and in your

658
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">system you just have a hash of your name</font>

659
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:04,889
and the time so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you include</font>

660
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,320
the last block in that hash as well and

661
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,850
that will actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give the</font>

662
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,800
adversary my advantage because the

663
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,899
adversary can like let's say the

664
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,850
adversary and somehow controls the

665
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,380
lights lock right and he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try many</font>

666
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,510
different contents of the last lock and

667
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">now you can try many different things so</font>

668
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,050
you wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove the</font>

669
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:26,790
protocol secure if you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

670
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:29,250
thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice talk I'm wondering how</font>

671
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,950
does this compare in terms of number of

672
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,550
transactions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get to sign like</font>

673
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,559
like there are certain distributed

674
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,629
transaction systems out there housing

675
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,800
firm performance which is usually people

676
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,870
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when they talk about scale</font>

677
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,309
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good question so we</font>

678
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,719
actually we do have an implementation

679
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:49,080
and we are in the process of like

680
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,550
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> evaluation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what I can say</font>

681
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that like for this classical</font>

682
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:56,010
presenting for tolerance for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cutlet</font>

683
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,960
pbr322 clay and you have like quadratic

684
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,450
metadata overhead because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has</font>

685
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,669
to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> every everyone else like some</font>

686
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,130
metadata in the protocol here like

687
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:05,830
everything is linear so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

688
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,010
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on</font>

689
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:12,879
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system is now around are and</font>

690
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,289
whether the system is now earthbound if

691
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,049
the different like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spy would sound</font>

692
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:19,539
let's say that then potentially this

693
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:23,830
protocol can can be nice but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

694
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:26,019
kind of latency pass and they're on ppv

695
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Feig is like if you don't saturate our</font>

696
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:29,799
network bandwidth then like is in the

697
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,809
optimistic case that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only need like</font>

698
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,549
constant number of runs but here maybe

699
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:39,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to wait for a few more blocks</font>

700
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:42,908
to get confirmation excellent talk so on

701
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:45,010
just one click when she so so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

702
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:48,519
model basically you can tolerate like

703
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:51,899
most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> onus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just in sleep mode</font>

704
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:54,340
but English if in this mode how you

705
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:56,379
guaranteed I to all needs a nose always

706
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:00,730
have the connection with other on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

707
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">note and so so that's a very good</font>

708
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:09,519
question and it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have</font>

709
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:11,350
two sun-like be in this model if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

710
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,510
have a relatively fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and you</font>

711
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,668
can receive messages within like some

712
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,330
parameter tau to delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Daniel</font>

713
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:20,769

714
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,960
however like if you temporarily let's

715
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:25,179
say you suffer from an hour and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

716
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,070
network connection and your messages are
