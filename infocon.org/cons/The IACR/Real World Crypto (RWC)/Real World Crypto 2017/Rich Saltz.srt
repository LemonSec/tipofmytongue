below going forward to the other you can

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,680
guess which way those I to the main

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,689
will die for other reasons my main point

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,570
here in the talk is to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,610
open are so came back from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dead and</font>

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,649
what some of the reasons were with some

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,480
of the pitfalls we encountered and

15
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,660
hopefully how the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid</font>

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,510
them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of openssl can be</font>

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,610
divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a few historical eras</font>

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,840
go over each of these in the next couple

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,989
of slides ssl ssl eay there's various

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,140

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,530
was two guys in the garage more

35
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:41,100
importantly it was two guys in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Australia</font>

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,780
ending in touches groups i worked with

40
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,149

were a handful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests minimal</font>

by hand but it worked the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> year it</font>

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,720
was open SSL the rise of openssl tim and

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,250
eric got day jobs

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,650
so they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to leave the</font>

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,240
package for various reasons a new group

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,070
started up there about many as a dozen

members folks from key with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache major</font>

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:27,269
motivation was export control again stay

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,510
away from the US we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so this is</font>

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:43,200
the team was scared to even land on US

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-announce there were no</font>

66
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,510
documented policies the source code was

67
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,930
complex and arcane if you looked at it

68
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:27,060
it would make your eyes hurt the braces

69
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,530
I thought nobody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> coded this way it</font>

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,010
turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's it's a style of</font>

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,880
was done via tables of dispatch function

74
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,359
pointers a lot of it still is not all of

75

it but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it still is and you just</font>

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,510
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code and it was like</font>

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,440
nothing else you ever used to it was

78
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:56,310
hard to maintain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl eay</font>

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,829
and open SSL was for a long time if

80
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:04,380
somebody gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a pack and it didn't</font>

81
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:06,750
break my system we take it they received

82
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,670
for a big failure in that philosophy

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,510

other projects we expected some folks

99
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,840
called of validation again doesn't

100
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,660
matter um they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on this works</font>

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,159
if validation is important to a large

104
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,870
source package the open source code was

105
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,660
a nice first open source source

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,810
validation it was a key saying it took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

107
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,850
lot of changing people's mindsets to

108
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,910
understand how I could validate a

109
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,910
package as a validate a clump of

110
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,940
software as opposed to validating a

hardware token but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened it's</font>

112
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,670
still going on it's just stopped right

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,270
now it'll come back the project

114
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:36,030
donations were minimal I don't know who

<font color="#E5E5E5">wrote that expression in parents I know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pearl azum stuff again</font>

146
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,680
talk to me catch me during the week

147
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,240
you'd see what looked like a perl script

148
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,860
generating assembly code and then you

149
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,870
looked and saw that each operand was

150
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,000
actually a subroutine call to actually

151
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,690
generate the real code it's pretty

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,370
obscure<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were occasional bugs but</font>

153
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:41,480
anyhow if you look at that that averages

154
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:43,370
out to you know barely a commit a day so

155
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,590
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened why was this his fault</font>

156
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,020
there was a long learning cycle to

157
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,070
understand the code everything was done

158
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:56,180
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extra level of indirection for</font>

159
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:58,599
example the threads package originally

160
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,570
done by<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike tindall that was ultimately</font>

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented as a runtime callback thing</font>

162
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,300
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't part of openssl but you</font>

163
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,240
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could create all these</font>

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,150
callbacks and at runtime say here's the

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,500
callbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> map to P threads which and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that participate for one time kind of</font>

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,390

168
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,830
callbacks that implements the error

169

codes and if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else want to</font>

170
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement their own package and storage</font>

171
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,309
of error codes they could do that at

172
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,020
runtime similarly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Malik right so</font>

173
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,820
everything that's how I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

there are a couple things were noticed a

216
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:16,180
lot of heart bleeds one was a

217
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,420
ridiculously simple bug right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

218
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,130
the ping packet and you said how many

219
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,839
bikes descend and it should have been

220
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,790
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> bikes were sent but it wasn't</font>

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,520
so sure would just send whatever data

222
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,089
happen to be there um it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

223
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,010
real security CD or first you'll see de

224
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:39,240
that had a logo a name

225
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:43,260
um so and it made the mainstream press I

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,780
don't know who Reba is but I think the

227
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,430
industry she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably moved on but the</font>

228
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,709
industry has not yet fully moved on from

229
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:56,780
Hartley right this is Daily Mirror a

230
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,780
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> speech Street publication in the UK</font>

231
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,980
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't okay she was shot okay shot</font>

232
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,839
and killed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so all right all right</font>

233
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,900
well I'm glad I hope she finds peace

234
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,070
there's no seriously man that was ever

235
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,290
that would stink if you had to see dog

236
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,790
anyhow but the fact that made the

237
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,589
mainstream press made everybody more

238
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,459
aware people getting call military pence

239
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,520
was there were plenty of other

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,170
front-page headlines the last fun page

241
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,730
had one I think was when the new york

242
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,010
times above the fold talked about the

243
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,010
blackened back or attack but more

244
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,350
importantly the fact that had a name was

245
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:42,020
really useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you could take</font>

246
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,700
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> league shell-shocked poodle um and</font>

247
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,670
it's a lot easier than having to

248
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,030
translate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a name if I said cv 2014 Oh</font>

249
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,949
150 maybe I had an off by one<font color="#E5E5E5"> error but</font>

250
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,949
maybe I meant something else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

251
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful it also gets really</font>

252
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,040
tedious because then you got to get a

253
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,829
domain name and you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a graphic</font>

254
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,189
artist to another or microsoft word art

255
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:08,880
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> your logo but the name is</font>

256
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,310
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i encourage researchers to</font>

257
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,280
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> names not websites and</font>

258
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,900
logos and the folks at inria are really

259
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,949
good at coming up with names or use

260
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:25,199
extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay recovery so now we answer</font>

261
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,490
the post heartbleed<font color="#E5E5E5"> say PHP um this the</font>

262
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,310
core infrastructure initiative was

263
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,730
created it was created both because of

264
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,250
the openness is a Hartley bug and it is

265
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,500
also funded and supported openssl very

266
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,300
well so it's for this mutual synergistic

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,830
thing we are both the

268
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,560
senator<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the poster child for what</font>

269
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,720
can happen things are done right

270
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,089
donations junk so we had 400 staff

271
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,279
members now they didn't have to do sips

272
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,630
work they didn't have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

273
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,220
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the street corner go quick go</font>

274
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">go go go six months later so about four</font>

275
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,290
months after heartbleed I was invited to

276
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,890
join the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dev team in October we had a</font>

277
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:06,599
face-to-face meeting funded by the CII

278
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:09,480
this was really really important and

279
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,779
useful and so one of the lessons is try

280
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get your dev team together we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

you're a persistent one place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

294
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,839
consensus as to where to put the curly

the jump notifications there was this

306
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,760
before we're expecting it to and so if

307
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,199
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of people in the room</font>

308
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,450
it becomes all of a sudden now world war

involved with 12 step program knows you

318
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,900
got to keep going to the meetings so

319
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping up the cadence we met again last</font>

320
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,329
october two years later now there was a

321
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,020
lot of discussion we had electrical<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bigger agenda still haven't published</font>

323
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,100
all of our notes and conclusions and

324
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,510
some of them are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the blog we went</font>

325
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,260
over spent a lot of time going over the

326
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:09,140
CDE notification process if you have

327
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own list of who to notify or pre</font>

notified for<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDEs everybody will want to</font>

329
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,189
be on that list it's really really hard

330
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:21,380
to come up with a bright white line to

331
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,410
separate those who get to know from

332
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,890
those who don't we empathize with those

333
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:30,650
who don't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we use the linux</font>

336
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,750
feed the top screen and then feed out we

337
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,750
also allow in many cases employers of

340
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,870
discussions about and with the CIA and

linux foundation the linux foundation is

342
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,880
the Secretariat and runs the CII we

343
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,229
discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to grow the team it's</font>

344
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,910
really important to us that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

345
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,270
more you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we seem to have a sense of</font>

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,689
vibrancy

347
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,010
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and it's alive we want to</font>

348
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,070
grow the team how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get more</font>

349
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,319
testing that's actually now that the

350
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,420
code seems to be a in good shape and<font color="#CCCCCC"> B</font>

351
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,640
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for keeping how can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

352
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,579
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon nobody wants</font>

353
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to write tests the one place I've seen</font>

354
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,510
it is in Japanese companies where they

355
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they feel happy when they found a bug</font>

356
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,090
because their tests found a bug um yeah

357
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,859
nobody always updated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap at</font>

358
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:36,420
platform box and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

359
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,910
regular release cadence that's informed

360
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,800
by the release process and calendar of

361
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,110
what we think large enterprises and

362
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,300
various other organizations do part of

363
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,180
the reason for doing this is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

364
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,540
get people off the old releases we want

365
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,489
to be able to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a planned thing so</font>

366
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:59,480
more transparency you have more beers<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

367
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:04,880
and try to make things predictable Thank

368
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:09,870
predictable expected not surprising

369
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,450
boring is a good work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay transparency</font>

370
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,520
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before for a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

371
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,810
you post to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and maybe</font>

372
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,490
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> male in this poster would</font>

373
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,750
respond maybe somebody you know if

374
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,390
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

375
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,160
somebody on the team would respond but

376
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,900
transparency is really really really

377
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,030
important building community document

378
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,920
what we do how we do it why we do it the

379
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,010
website was overhauled<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still got way</font>

380
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,850
too much word on it because the initial

381
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,690
authors of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> content were swiss and</font>

382
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,969
german and their language is much more

383
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,810
thermal particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the writing</font>

384
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,750
english then say mine they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

385
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,520
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> FR on the website but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would the</font>

386
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,080
mailing lists relieved why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

387
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,480
interesting because we were previously

388
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,970
using something called majordomo which

389
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,490
was created in the 80s not mailman which

390
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,990
everybody else uses we sped up the RT

391
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,910
approval process they have multiple

392
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,850
moderators and then ultimately we killed

393
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,720
our team

394
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:13,719
because nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> really uses it and if you</font>

395
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,300
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think a virtuous</font>

396
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,950
cycle when<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project isn't a black hole</font>

397
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,419
people contribute when people contribute

398
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,040
they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project isn't a black hole</font>

399
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,310
and that he hit this really nice

400
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,250
feedback loop code quality another part

401
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recovery appearances count we</font>

402
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,950
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost repeatable code reformatting</font>

405
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,910
run the reformat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the same</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thing mandatory removed by second team</font>

407
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,150
member the team the reviews vary from

408
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,490
yet okay like if somebody's posts

409
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,390
assembler code I'm like yeah sure for

410
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,580
IBM said it works on their platform

411
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,690
great because i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know systems the</font>

412
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,360
assembler<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm never going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

413
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,580
systems the assembler but sure so we

414
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,080
have sometimes we're done pro forma for

415
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,080
process sometimes where people get

416
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,659
really down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it now that we're</font>

417
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,659
doing everything on github we are

418
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:12,180
starting to see more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,560
full request which is that we're still

421
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,820
we're still working to improve the

422
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:26,320
quality of our reviews isn't great isn't

423

as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we want it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be that would</font>

425
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,250
actually take it that's the first part

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,129
that would have caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> horribly we're</font>

427
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,510
doing more tests we run coveralls as

part of a regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuous integration</font>

429
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,280

most structures are opaque I'm gonna

457
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,230
have to talk even faster I'll skip the

458

459

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,830
somebody changed the shell script to

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,040
remove 10 lines and the code coverage

462
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:11,730
went down I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take shelter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crypts I</font>

closed off a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs the</font>

473
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,750
now so what's happened on github here's

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics that Kenny a desk when I</font>

didn't check we introduced a bug in
