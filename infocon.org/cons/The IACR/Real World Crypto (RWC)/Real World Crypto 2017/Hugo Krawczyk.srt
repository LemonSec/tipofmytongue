00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:14,809
anyone can overstate the central role

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,930
that the passwords have in securing our

bad situation and an acceptable state of

high entropy independent passwords with

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,470
equally unrealistic and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,540
that we are here is whether

the state of insecurity of passwords and

41

we will show<font color="#CCCCCC"> some examples of different</font>

similarities with work done by boil and

53
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,430
we will cut this in the more modern

that they can help transferring some of

these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> into practice so the the</font>

mainly source of the path of leakage are

offline dictionary attacks they they are

67
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,760
the product of the deadly combination of

68
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,659
the low entropy passwords which come out

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the inherent limitations of human</font>

72
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,638
guess what we call the password file

73
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:08,370
which contains hushed versions of the

74
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,099
user passwords and with the hash of the

75
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,829
password an attacker with the dictionary

76
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,159
a list of potential passes can check

77
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:20,340
which of the password thing the list is

78
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:22,289
actually a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> users password if</font>

79
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,820
a user chose the password in in the

80
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,890
dictionary then it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

81
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,120
what make this very effective is that

82
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the very special software hardware</font>

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,750

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,090
exhaustive searches of our dictionaries

85
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,550
and they can do many many millions of

86
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets of these things per second so this</font>

87
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,880
is a very practical way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking this</font>

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,580
worst news is that offline<font color="#CCCCCC"> dictionary</font>

attacks are unavoidable upon server

<font color="#CCCCCC">compromise whatever the doesn't matter</font>

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,420
what your protocol does and what your

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,030

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this unavoidable exhaustive attacks</font>

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,450
in a section and we for that we either

101
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,770
need to use high entropy passwords or

102
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:31,450
add more elements to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol</font>

103
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:33,880
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and so in the first part</font>

104
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,909
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chakra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be talking about a</font>

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,820
way of taking the burden of choosing and

106
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,680
memorizing passwords away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> humans</font>

107
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,920
because as long as we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,550
then low entropy password<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only</font>

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">option and for this we know the solution</font>

110
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:56,500
there is a a sorcerer but for managers

111
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,530
that keep a list of passwords that the

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,930
user can take in a device or access on

113
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clip online and it keeps it</font>

114
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,040
encrypted on the master password so that

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,190
the user only needs to remember that

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,850
master password in that sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

117
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,600
removes the need to remember many

118
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,830
complicated person you can have only one

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,600
hopefully non-trivial master password

120
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:28,270
now this is this a good type of solution

121
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,750
in in practice the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think are</font>

122
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,520
implemented is not always great if you

123
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,320
have any a list of passwords which

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,650
included under master password and a

125
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,780
cycle that find the list can do an

126
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,479
offline dictionary attack on the mat

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,359
surface or this week defines the master

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:50,590
password kinds of also all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the battles</font>

129
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,770
of the user also if Assad having a

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,799
device on a server exactly the attacker

131
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,990
is inside that device then when the user

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,940
enters the master password can be

133
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,250
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way and again all the</font>

134
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,140
puzzles are compromised also there are

135
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes in the communication</font>

137
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:14,650
additional to all of that many of these

138
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,710
other managers actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> so use of chosen</font>

139
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,770
passwords which means to gain the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,169
somewhat low entropy and repeated among

141
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,650

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,409
bad things that happened with<font color="#CCCCCC"> puzzles so</font>

143
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:36,330
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do better and the answer is yes</font>

we cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave for the next 15 days yes</font>

146
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,039
want to spend time do so now extend even

147
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:53,979
more saying that they had let's make

148
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:56,740
passwords great again so so he is a

dream password store all passwords are

150
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,530
kept in the in a user's device or online

151
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,650
the user memorizes a single master

152
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,628
password as in any password store and

153
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,099
now all puzzles are going to be random

154
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and independent of each other which is</font>

155
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:15,490
the way they should be but in addition

156
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,759
an attacker that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets hold of the device</font>

157
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:22,870
of the store or even has full control of

158
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,080
the device there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing and nothing</font>

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,440
about the individual store passwords

160
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,289
nothing about the master password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

161
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,269
so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work first of all what</font>

162
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,010
I think that thing I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an</font>

163
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,229
information-theoretic nothing I mean

164
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,179
it's a dream the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password store so we</font>

165
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,750
can ring with information theoretic

00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:46,060
security the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> store in the</font>

167
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,920

169
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,620
individual very password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you see</font>

170
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:57,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that storage and you see</font>

171
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,949
nothing about the the master pattern of

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,720
the individual passwords the clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

173
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:05,140
but the master password is never

177
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,390

exaggeration

186
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:53,388
okay so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you how this works</font>

187
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:56,730
so we have a user and user we have a

188
00:09:53,389 --> 00:10:00,720
remote server client machine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

189
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,939
device the user starts by inputting the

190
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,610
master<font color="#E5E5E5"> past or PWD will be the master</font>

191
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:09,059
password which is sent to the device the

192
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,850
device as a PRF key<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a</font>

193
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:14,910
scheme based on the PLF PLF can be h

194
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,679
mark cbc mark or something like that the

195
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,170
password is sent to the device device

196
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,019
has whiskey case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day it computes</font>

197
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,860
the PRF using the key K sub D on the

198
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,290
password this is sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the terminal</font>

199
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,829
client machine my machine gets that way

200
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:35,189
value bit of Paris<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> college RWD</font>

201
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:38,459
and RW z is actually the password which

202
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:41,160
is specific to that a server and now

203
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:44,118
between the client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server they</font>

204
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,670
run whatever protocol the riveter with

205
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:50,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">rwb so RWD the pseudo random password</font>

206
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,490
that basically the user had to register

207
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:56,670
initially with the server think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

208
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook your bank whatever so each one</font>

209
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">each server that are each account that</font>

210
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:07,229
the user has will have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> lwd</font>

211
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:11,219
and the way you compute it is you add to

212
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:15,029
the PRF<font color="#E5E5E5"> computation the URL or some some</font>

213
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier of that service or or the</font>

214
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:20,339
account and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making any</font>

215
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,459
assumptions on the path of protocol we

216
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,379
just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> lwb will be the most typical</font>

217
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:30,258
protocol whatever you use with that

218
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:34,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">server will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used with our WT ok so</font>

219
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:36,990
this solution already gives you a part

220
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,209
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted it one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whiskey</font>

221
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,959
because other diseases<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the random</font>

222
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,800
then offline attacks are infeasible if

223
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,459
the dictionary will be too big to to run

224
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,969
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vatican II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the storage here on</font>

225
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:54,699
the device is<font color="#CCCCCC"> K sub D which was chosen</font>

226
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,970
independently of the master password

227
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:03,320
they are the individual password so the

228
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,620
storage if you find the storage unit

229
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,370
rates of these you don't learn anything

230
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,600
about the master password the problem

231
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,110
with the solution is that the matter

232
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">paso PWD is being sent in the clear to</font>

233
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,200
the device so anyone on the link here or

234
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:24,079
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device controls the muscle</font>

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,519

oblivious PRF an oblivious PRF is

237
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,630
exactly the same idea except that now

238
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,930
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the password from the user</font>

239
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:39,050
the client machine client machine

240
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,779
chooses a one-time key with which it

241
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,990
encrypts the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">path organs encrypted to the device the</font>

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,360

244
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:55,880
output an encryption under that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same key</font>

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,700
of the PRF value ok now for doing that

246
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,980
the device does not need to decrypt the

247
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,899
control it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete the password</font>

248
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does not name the PRS value</font>

249
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,800
either because the PRS value is

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,209
generated already in encrypted form

251
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,750
these were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic of cryptography</font>

252
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:17,359
something to play and if we have that

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because now the</font>

increases PRF is only learned by the

<font color="#E5E5E5">because RWD pseudo-random them offline</font>

discouraging the device is still

261
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,510
independent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords but now we</font>

262
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:48,320
also have the master<font color="#E5E5E5"> password hidden</font>

263
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:51,500
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire and from the device so</font>

264
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,320
this is nice the only question is how do

265
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,000
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement something like this ok so</font>

266
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,730
if you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully homomorphic</font>

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,990
encryption that

268

implementation this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I would</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have called mature and an efficient</font>

270
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,660
technology so instead we'll do something

271
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,970
simpler than that here is the

272

implementation user<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter the password</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say first that how do we</font>

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,079
define this particular oprf the

294
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:39,620
how we define the oprf<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and now we can</font>

295
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,170
do our use<font color="#CCCCCC"> RWD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the server as before</font>

attack KD is independent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wdr WD</font>

298
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,420

of these exponents are essentially works

303
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,449
at the one time pad here and nothing

304

306
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:20,939
this is the dream pastor store that I

308
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:27,719
that's all you need now so on this can

309
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:31,229
work with any client server at some sort

310

so you can choose the film a group that

325

we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken these ideas and build</font>

here if the attacker gets the device and

doesn't mean that you need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,799
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret so of course the</font>

437
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,460
server will have to authenticate the

438
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,710
user

439
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,360
scored using a password what is the user

<font color="#CCCCCC">password for all the servers so now</font>

442
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,689
instead of one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failure we have</font>

n point of failures any server that is

444
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,980
compromised you find the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

445
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,360
now you can access all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

446
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers so of course if you ask the user</font>

447
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,110
to choose the independent random

<font color="#CCCCCC">independently password for the different</font>

449
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,000

450
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,520
we have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this approach</font>

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,399
what we really want is this primitive

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,490
called a password-protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal</font>

servers after which the user forgets the

and that's enough for<font color="#CCCCCC"> him to reconstruct</font>

485
00:24:53,929 --> 00:25:04,970
questions Wow okay so it's a single

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,660
single equalization fire for each server

487

490
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,510
do also three multiplications or

additions in the elliptical

492
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,559
implementation which are like

493
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,620
inexpensive operations the communication

494
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:32,450
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> single message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the user to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font>

is no communication between the server

now there is no authentic no PK is<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

for initialization in which case the

501
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,649
user wants to identify an authenticator

502
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,620
servers it is sharing the secret with

503
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,230
but not after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the way a</font>

multi mention that may be seeking

of of a TLS interaction with the server

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:13,549
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really really inexpensive and</font>

510
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:16,970
I will not talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this looks see</font>

511
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:20,030
the papers what I'm going to do is the

512
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:23,090
very first tell you about this xaxa

513
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,220
protocol which is a protocol for this if

514
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,139
you have a single silver situation and

515
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,030
what is the best protocol that you can

516
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,980
run at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least a protocol with very nice</font>

517
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:37,100
properties by the way this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

518
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:40,309
protocol that is our PPSS scheme but for

519
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,219
the case N equals 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> T equals one and a</font>

520
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:46,059
very similar protocol was already

521
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:52,460
proposed by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boyle several years ago</font>

522
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:53,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I have liked to show how an</font>

523
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of how this works I will not be</font>

524
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,230
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but let me tell you what</font>

525
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,190
the properties of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are so in</font>

526
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,529
any single server pay

527
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,590
what is called an asymmetrical augmented

528
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:11,009
take you want that the security such

529
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:13,470
that if the server relax enjoy if the

530
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,759
attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks into a server it still</font>

531
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to run an offline dictionary</font>

532
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,470
attack for example if you share if you

533
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">put the user password in the clear</font>

534
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,250
inside the server this is not a good

535
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,129
solution you want to force the attacker

536
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,110
to do a dictionary attack so that's

537
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:30,658
something we always wanting this kind of

538
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers we want that no pre-computation</font>

539
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:38,840
prior to the time in which the attacker

540
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:42,720
breaks the server will help the attacker

541
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,299
this is what we use a secret salt for

542
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,909
and we would like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server will</font>

543
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:51,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">never see the password in plain text no</font>

544
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:53,789
reliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> on t ki and if possible to be</font>

545
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to offload the hash iterations that</font>

546
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:59,220
you do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> key stretching on the user</font>

547
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:02,549
side I mean there any any balancing that

548
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,860
you you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and the regular thing</font>

549
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:07,259
that we do now pasodoble TLS has the

550
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,939
first two properties but it doesn't give

551

00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,570
is the password in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Playtex of course</font>

554
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:18,539
it's very dependent on pick a yard

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,570
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ki pls brakes completely and</font>

556
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:25,169
you cannot do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flaw offloading if</font>

557
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:29,519
you don't want to reveal the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dassault</font>

558
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:31,830
other other protocols in this is a type

559
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,450
of protocols in the literature gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">three and four but the combination of</font>

561
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:39,299

562
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,639
the protocols I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to to</font>

563
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:44,450
this protocol which actually has all the

564
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:47,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">properties so it's a very strong</font>

565
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,370
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll show you only one</font>

566
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,220
thing they to understand that protocol

567
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,219
you take things as i showed before and

568
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,799
you just move the server to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side of</font>

569
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the device and that's it and now you run</font>

570
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,250
the same protocol that you run with the

571
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,220
device before you run it with the server

572
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:11,039
and this all you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and even if</font>

573
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,679
you want to do a full AKA of<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicated</font>

575
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,269
still get

a 22<font color="#E5E5E5"> message protocol if you want to do</font>

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:27,089
explicit client authentication you need

578
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:30,329
to add one more ok let me two minutes

579
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:34,499
for conclusions one minute one minute so

580
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:36,448
subtle battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree that</font>

581
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:40,619
the partial vulnerability is a big

582
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:44,539
problem we will always to show that

583
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:48,269
patterning security is not debatable a

584
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:50,249
cute ography has some interesting

585
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:54,949
solutions in these different settings

586
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:58,589
and all schemes that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> present our have</font>

587
00:29:54,949 --> 00:30:03,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">our basal security former security</font>

588
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:05,458
models and proofs of security anyway

589
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,589
mature efficient simple technology just

590
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:11,309
waiting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be deployed and here you have</font>

591
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,289
the references<font color="#CCCCCC"> this long one you can</font>

592
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:18,060
make if you want to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in a</font>

593
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:25,639
file to our LAX easy thank you

594
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:31,049
[Applause]

595
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:33,000
yeah okay thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your first protocol</font>

596
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,330
really elegant I really liked it you

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,460
said you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with your google or</font>

598
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,580
your employer or whatever what if your

599
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,350
employer is one of these evil employers

600
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,658
that forces you to change your passwords

601
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,580
every 30 days I hate them yeah I hate

602
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you like where did you</font>

603
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,809
in click your little just encrypt

604
00:30:49,500 --> 00:31:00,350
gunshot not confuse us with engineering

605
00:30:51,809 --> 00:31:03,960
problems yeah very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question and so</font>

606
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,490
the solution basically is that I mean

607
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,950
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution I can think about is</font>

608
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,509
that you will keep the counter you can

609
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:14,039
if you are willing to store your

610
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:16,889
accounts on the device then it is it

611
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:19,080
because the account will will store the

612
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,090
counter and it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the PRF</font>

613
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,830
if you do that then is simple if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

614
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,959
don't want to do that then there is a

615
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">programming either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user will have to</font>

616
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,480
remember the counter or write it down or

617
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:32,190
you know something like though if the

618
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,279
site you're trying to log into requires

619
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:42,330
you to have a symbol and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and</font>

620
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:44,549
like and it anyway the there is another

621
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,320
engineering question what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if the</font>

622
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,700
passwords are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being on the past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

623
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to be serious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in books like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

624
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,519
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and that and these are all</font>

625
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:55,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">solvable in one way or another but but</font>

626
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes so but I don't think any of these</font>

627
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">things really kill to the solution all</font>

628
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">right why we go again</font>

629
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,750
