00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,790
Kenny given a my talk I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font>

my fabulous co-authors here some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whom</font>

imparting to tallish Monica and I have

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,680
to shamelessly plug my Twitter because

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,050
social media is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future so you can</font>

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,730
tweet at me so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you</font>

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,500
today about web applications and this is

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,019
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of application</font>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,668
that ubiquitous so people don't really

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it but that's what I want to</font>

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,410
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today web applications</font>

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,750
have roughly two parts there's a client

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">that runs on a user's browser on a</font>

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,510
mobile phone and the data generated by

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,680
this client is stored on some back-end

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,570
server and not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client the this</font>

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,730
model works great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ubiquitous</font>

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and everybody uses it until there's a</font>

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,019
data breach and these happen all the

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,050
time and all of the confidentiality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users data is compromised so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,119
a bad thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally we want to</font>

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,630
avoid so one solution that people

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,090
proposed is to encrypt the data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,289
server the data generated by the clients

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,880
we want to encrypt it with the key

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,210
that's stored on the client only and

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,548
never kind of seen by the server so when

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,189
there's a data breach of this of the

34
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,970
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that storing all of this data</font>

35
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,860
nothing's actually leaked because

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,070
everything is encrypted right and this

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> neatly solves the problem of you</font>

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,809
know confidentiality of being violated

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,030
by a data breach but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font>

40
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,619
basic stuff like kind of like searching

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,600
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things you want to do with your</font>

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,100
data don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work anymore because</font>

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,919
this encryption just removes all the

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">functionality from the from from the</font>

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,850
data so one idea that that the people

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,380
have have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with in the last</font>

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so is to kind of strike a</font>

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,030
middle ground<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of a kind of</font>

49
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,009
balance between these two extremes where

50
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,750
we use a primitive called property

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,549
revealing encryption which has been

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,030
looked at by cryptographers in the last

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,670
few years where we reveal a property of

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,619
the data that's not everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's</font>

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,239
enough to enable a certain specific

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,000
functionality that's useful for

57
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,470
application but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still maintain some</font>

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,900
kinds of provable confidentiality

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:24,000
guarantees about the data so systems

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,610
people systems builders have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,430
notice this idea and notice notices

62
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,080
utility in building secure systems so we

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,690
in this work we identified a class of

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,790
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all roughly use property</font>

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">reveal encryption to build a system that</font>

66
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,000
preserves confidentiality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data and we</font>

67
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,010
came up with the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goofy acronym</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bo</font>

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,570
pets for building on property revealing

69
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,760
encryption for these systems this is a

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,560
table just of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> common pyaari schemes</font>

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,250
as well as the the systems or companies

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,760
that use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't name every name in</font>

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,670
this table but searchable encryption is

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,100
something I'll explain in the next slide

75
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:08,339
so just to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a sense of the the</font>

76
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,579
interest in in bullpen if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

77
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this all the startups in this table</font>

78
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,090
they cumulative we have received about

79
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,880
two hundred million dollars of VC

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,120
funding from like Anderson Horowitz<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

81
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,010
sequoia and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greylock so there's like you</font>

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,330
know there's a probable interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

83
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,359
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people are really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

84
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">these systems so now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we understand</font>

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a bolt head is let's look at an</font>

86
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hypothetical file sharing</font>

87
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,780
application called cloud drive so the

88
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,690
orange user has a secret diary that they

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,000
want to store in the cloud but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

90
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,190
to encrypt it so the clouds can't see it

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it uses a key that's stored on this</font>

92
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,810
client and encrypts this document now

93
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,609
when the orange user wants to search its

94
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,290
document to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it contains a</font>

95
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,510
certain keyword it can use this key to

96
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,810
kind of delegate a search token<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

97
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,519
allows the cloud to search now if the

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,990
orange user wants to collaborate with

99
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,680
the blue user on a different document

100
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,300
that's perhaps something work-related

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,030
they both need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

102
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> document and the the blue document</font>

103
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is encrypted with a different key than</font>

104
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,600
the orange document to kind of because

105
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,100
the orange users the orange document is

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,570
private to the orange user and the

107
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,079
orange user doesn't want any other user

108
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,860
to be able

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,509
see it so the orange user when it wants

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,210
to search it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it should</font>

111
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,250
do this in a naive way of doing this is

112
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,310
to issue a search token for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

113
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,280
Alec access control or every single kind

114
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,319
of access group that it has access to so

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,020
this scales badly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it requires the</font>

116
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,580
client to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work so in 2013</font>

117
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">Copeland's elevation introduced a</font>

118
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,539
primitive called multi key searchable

119
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,939
encryption which<font color="#E5E5E5"> really neatly solves</font>

120
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:53,699
this problem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does so using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,610
following idea rather than sharing the

122
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,379
key and requiring the orange user to

123
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,699
generate different search<font color="#CCCCCC"> trapdoors for</font>

124
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,039
every different<font color="#E5E5E5"> document is shared with</font>

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,900
it gives the blue use of the ability to

126
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,389
tell the server to add the orange user

127
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,638
to this document and what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> orange</font>

128
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,860
users what the orange<font color="#E5E5E5"> juice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or does is</font>

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,990
it generates a bit of cryptographic

130
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,909
information that it gives to the server

131
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,919
which essentially delegates to the

132
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:21,479
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to convert its search</font>

133
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,139
tokens to searches under the blue key so

134
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,199
the advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is that you can</font>

135
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can issue just one search token and</font>

136
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,979
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search and the server will</font>

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,250
essentially do these research token

138
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,250
conversions for you so this you know

139
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,039
solves the problem that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

140
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:45,270
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool p re</font>

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,430
scheme but it's it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

142
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,779
build a system out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this p re scheme</font>

143
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,430
since we're we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at the railroad</font>

144
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,139
crypto conference so we should try to

145
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,060
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to build real systems</font>

146
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,919
and we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't just use a</font>

147
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,139
crypto scheme in practice we need to

148
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">build a system around it and there's</font>

149
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,159
been some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like David's talk</font>

150
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,169
covered some work that looks at the

151
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">security pyaari in isolation but there</font>

152
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,409
haven't really been any work any

153
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,839
holistic work on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a whole</font>

154
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,879
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that preserves the</font>

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,370
confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user's data so</font>

156
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,199
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we asked</font>

157
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,909
in this work which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we build a</font>

158
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:24,719
system that uses pyaari to provide

159
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:26,460
confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users so to kind of</font>

160
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,800
assess this question we we did a case

161
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,190
study on a bulkhead called mylar which

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,120
was a which was a paper published in<font color="#CCCCCC"> NS</font>

163
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">di 2014 by hope at all</font>

164
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,070
mylar basically uses the meteor

165
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript web application framework and</font>

166
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,070
builds build some cryptographic

168
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the multi key searchable encryption</font>

169
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,198
functionality that I discussed earlier

170
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,448
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as some key key management and</font>

171
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:58,830
access control and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that so</font>

172
00:06:52,449 --> 00:07:00,850
the the mylar the mylar server kind of

173
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,199
handles<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests from the different</font>

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">here aren't too important you should</font>

178
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,840
basically just understand that this is

179
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,370
metadata<font color="#E5E5E5"> about access control</font>

relationships between<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents and</font>

181
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,830
clients the security goals mylar simple

182
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,780
mylar wants to protect the

183
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,430
confidentiality of the data against

184
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,179
attackers with full access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

185
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,960
and in this work we identified three

186
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,160
major threat models that a bowhead

187
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,400
including any book<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID including miler</font>

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,860
should be able to defend the user

189
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,690
confidentiality against attacks the

190
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,460
weakest is the snapshot passive threat

191
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,370
which is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> kava risible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time</font>

192
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,289
snapshot of the database the stronger

193
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,400
threat model is the persistent passive

194
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:51,130
one where the adversary has a persistent

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,500
monitoring of the of this system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

196
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,539
strongest threat model which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

197
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,090
claimed by mylar is active threat model

198
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,760
which basically allows the server to

199
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,859
issue arbitrary responses and even to

200
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,169
collude with some users so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

201
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,210
is the wording in the mylar paper that

202
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,190
this is their active threat model

203
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,539
essentially and don't worry about

204
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading this all right now we'll come</font>

205
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:16,419
back to it a little bit so to

206
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,729
investigate these threat models we we

207
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,500
looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> four applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of which</font>

208
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,080
was released<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the mylar paper and</font>

209
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,639
three that we ported to use mylar

210
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,490
according to the guidelines in the mylar

211
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,010
paper and in the threat model claim by

212
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,690
mylar we give an attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

213
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,909
simulated workload recovers a hundred

214
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,700
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the users keyword queries and</font>

215
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,679
about seventy percent of all the

216
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,120
keywords in the encrypted documents and

217
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain this attack a little bit</font>

218
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,280
later we also give to weaker attacks

219
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,449
that one of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll discuss and one</font>

220
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,370
of which you should refer to our paper

221
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,410
for

222
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,710
in the mylar paper they explicitly do

223
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,600
not claim to protect access patterns so

224
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,070
in this talk I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on the</font>

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,530
snapshot passive threat model and the

226
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,020
active threat model because these are

227
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the artax in these threat model do not</font>

228
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,569
use data access patterns or

229
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,460
communication or<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing patterns so our</font>

230
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,470
attack in the weakest up model the

231
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,920
snapshot passive threat model is a

232
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,710
simple the the attack it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically uses</font>

233
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,689
this metadata that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before</font>

234
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:24,730
and this metadata is is kind of crucial

235
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,800
for the system to function correctly but

236
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,410
it's not a it's not encrypted existing

237
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,170
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't bother to encrypt the the</font>

238
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,350
metadata and of course we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

239
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,030
important metadata is so this metadata

240
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,180
has some inherent risks that haven't

241
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,400
really been explored before this it's

242
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,989
not protected in existing systems but it

243
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,140
is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system to</font>

244
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,260
work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metadata itself it depends</font>

245
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,560
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and if the designers of the</font>

246
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,390
system aren't careful then this metadata

247
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,400
could by itself leaked the information

248
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is intended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be protected by the</font>

249
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,010
encryption scheme and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

250
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,630
observation this attack is fully in

251
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,470
scope and doesn't use any access

252
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,840
patterns or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing patterns so to see</font>

253
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,460
how metadata can leak information we

254
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,980
need to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> no further</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than this</font>

255
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,680
diagram from the mylar paper this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

256
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,030
scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> where two users of a chat</font>

257
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,199
application are talking about a party

258
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,300
that they want to go to and they have a

259
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,030
boss that doesn't want the they don't

260
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,310
want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the party in fact</font>

261
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,510
this the text says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope my boss</font>

262
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,280
won't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

263
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,439
confidentiality goal here is fairly

264
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,100
clear we the boss shouldn't find out

265
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,590
about the party this the chat data

266
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,240
itself is encrypted by my alarm but the

267
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,190
the metadata is not encrypted by mylar

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
in particular there's a there's an

269
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,850
access control principle that

270
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,220
corresponds roughly to like a search

271
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,810
encryption key and the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

272
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,910
access control principle is actually in

273
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:59,170
plain text and in this scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

274
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,920
party and the clear conclusion here is

275
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the boss will know about the party</font>

276
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,510
and because the users that have access

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,279
to this principle their access control

278
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,110
principles are not encrypted the names

279
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,850
aren't encrypted either the boss will

280
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,810
know exactly who's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

281
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,050
well so this this attack is a little

282
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,839
subtle so we should pause here and kind

283
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,160
of say a few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> words about metadata</font>

284
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,850
metadata is kind of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glue that</font>

285
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,230
that builds a system out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a PRA scheme</font>

286
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,940
it's necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all systems but</font>

287
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,949
especially in multi user settings like

288
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,690
the one targeted by mylar where there's

289
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,359
kind of like complex access control

290
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,430
relationships between<font color="#CCCCCC"> different users</font>

291
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,329
metadata is crucial for stuff like key

292
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,519

293
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:46,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> miler but all systems don't really</font>

294
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,070
encrypt the metadata so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

295
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,269
presumably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't expect</font>

296
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,880
there to be any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of confidentiality</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">loss from this metadata but what we what</font>

298
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,910
we want to motivate in this talk is that

299
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,560
there is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways in which</font>

300
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,910
metadata by itself can compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

301
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,369
confidentiality of user data so our

attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the active threat model is is</font>

303
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,350
pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just to review the</font>

304
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:15,500
active threat model is one in which the

305
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,390
server can perform arbitrary actions and

306
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,050
in fact collude with some of the users

307
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:23,029
of the system so in the mylar paper the

308
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,620
way the way they phrase it is that the

309
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,040
application in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database servers can</font>

310
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fully controlled by an adversary</font>

311
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">miler also allows some user machines to</font>

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,649
be controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the adversary and to</font>

313
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:35,750
collude with the server in this threat

314
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,720
model are our attack is pretty simple

315
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,779
suppose the multi key searchable

316
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,170
encryption functionality before these

317
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:48,170
this access token not access token sorry

318
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,269
be the key conversion token used in the

319
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,010
multi key surgical encryption scheme

320
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:58,000
suppose that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adversary gets the gets</font>

321
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,870
the the token for a key that it knows

322
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,449
then when the users does a search the

323
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,610
the adversary can use this token as well

324
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:09,949
as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the key that it knows to</font>

325
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,490
kind of get a nun keyed hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of</font>

326
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,109
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword and then it can use a kind</font>

327
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a brute for</font>

329
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,760

330
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,740
this through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leakage of the</font>

331

332
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,079
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like which which documents</font>

333
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,610
match a query this compromises the

334
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,209
contents of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

335
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain this more in a few slides</font>

336
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,719
so not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the attack we can</font>

337
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,550
ask ourselves like how how can the

338
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,589
adversary get a token for a key that it

339
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,649
knows well there's basically two ways

340
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:47,079
this could happen if the adversary is

341
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,690
able to trick the user into accepting a

342
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,790
share of an adversarial document<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh or</font>

343
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,500
if the user shares a document with the

344
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,209
adversary then the adversary gets

345
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,300
basically the system the way the mylar

346
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:04,119
system works it will produce a the

347
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,189
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adversary needs in</font>

348
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,839
mylar there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hypothetical defense</font>

349
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,480
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack it's not supported</font>

350
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,100
in the current mylar codebase but it

351
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,190
basically is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the application</font>

352
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,240
developer to to force the user to

353
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,130
explicitly accept searches and this this

354
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,230
this countermeasure is not used and

355
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,740
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sake of argument</font>

356
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,899
imagine that this countermeasure works

357
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,899
perfectly and every user only shares

358
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,100
documents with people that they trust

359
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,620
there's still yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

360
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,930
adversary to get the token which is for

361
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,260
the adverse search corrupt a user like a

362
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,689
trusted user of the system so in the

363
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,000
mylar threat model they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an</font>

364
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,709
adversary can collude with some user

365
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,180
machines and that a reason why this

366
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,239
might happen is because the average I

367
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,339
broke into a user's machine so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this would work is imagine that the</font>

369
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,779
orange user trust the blue user and

370
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,209
allow search functions well in this

371
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:02,949
setting it works correctly and the

372
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,040
orange user accepts a share of the

373
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,439
shared document from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue user so if</font>

374
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,640
after this happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue user is</font>

375
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,430
hacked the adversary gets the blue key

376
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,290
which allows it to perform the same

377
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">brute-force attack on the orange users</font>

378
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,730
search search<font color="#E5E5E5"> token search queries</font>

379
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,110
rather and because if the adversary has

380
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,370
the blue key that's pretty clearly

381
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,089
compromises the content

382
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:34,150
the blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> document right but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

383
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:36,540
for the orange document and in mylar the

384
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,800
guarantee is made that the

385
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,199
confidentiality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a data item</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

386
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,729
protected as long as none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

387
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,550
with access to that data<font color="#CCCCCC"> item</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

388
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,910
compromise machine so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

389
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:52,180
what the claim security would be but

390
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:54,670
through the leakage of which whether a

391
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,400
story matches a document if if the

392
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,349
orange user makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a search that matches</font>

393
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,670
this orange document the contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

394
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,940
this document are going to be leaked as

395
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,650
well so this this shows how the the

396
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,890
confidentiality guarantee mylar is

397
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:11,260
violated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack this has all</font>

398
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,839
been a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit abstract so we should</font>

399
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,240
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be concrete about a setting in</font>

400
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,029
which this attack could occur the

401
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,010
medical setting is used in all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

402
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,570
place in applied crypto and in the mylar

403
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,930
paper it's used as an explicit example

404
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:29,830
of a an access control graph in a search

405
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,469
system so in a hospital this the result

406
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this attack is simple if doctors and</font>

407
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,370
nurses are collaborating to treat

408
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,430
patients and one nurse loses their

409
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,459
laptop the private files of the doctor

410
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:46,150
can also be compromised and allow search

411
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:49,180
is not a defense against this attack so

412
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:51,520
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we understand the the impact of</font>

413
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably come back</font>

414
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,930
and say how the contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

415
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,370
documents can be compromised when the

416
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,589
orange user makes a search that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

417
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">adversary knows the functionality of the</font>

418
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,610
search scheme allows the adversary to

419
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,339
tell whether that keyword exists in a

420
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,250
document so as the user makes more

421
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:13,958
queries more contents of the document

422
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:16,179
are going to be revealed so an important

423
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,429
question here is like in typical

424
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,750
application settings how much how much

425
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,770
of the document contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

426
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,510
revealed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to test this we did</font>

427
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,410
experiments using the boon to chat log

428
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,980
corpus for kind of stand-in chat log

429
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,059
data and to sample user queries we

430
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,720
sampled according to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution of</font>

431
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:40,799
e words this followed prior work and

432
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,710
we did this because there really isn't

433
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,980
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't good research yet on</font>

434
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:52,210
realistic user query distributions but

435
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:55,179
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed prior work on user for</font>

436
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,100
I distributions but this this is kind of

437
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,659
an artificial synthetic query

438
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,549
distribution so an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open question is</font>

439
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:02,470
really characterizing real use your

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,780
query distributions like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

441
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,340

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,990
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a brute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force dictionary the</font>

443
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,090
largest dictionary of english words we

444
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,030
could find which was roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 350</font>

445
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,070
thousand words and using the the mylar

446
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,629
searchable encryption scheme pre

447
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,189
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack dictionary only</font>

448
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,440
takes about 15 minutes of war fought

449
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,120
time it's it's really really fast if not

450
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in a single thread and this is a</font>

451
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,120
parallel izybelle operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> even so this</font>

452
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,240
this attack with the simulated query

453
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,949
workload starts at with a hundred

454
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,070
queries can recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 28 or 29</font>

455
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,919
percent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keywords in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documents</font>

456
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as you get up to about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 queries</font>

457
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,549
you get to sixty-eight sixty-nine

458
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,750
percent recovery of all of the keywords

459
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:52,690
across all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the simulated user</font>

460
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:54,549
documents so this this act of attack is

461
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,520
clearly very powerful and it's powerful

462
00:18:54,549 --> 00:19:01,480
for a few reasons it can recover the

463
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,840
search keywords using just a offline

464
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,130
brute force dictionary so it can if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

465
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,379
search for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a word that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

466
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,289
appear in any document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

467
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,870
can still recover it using this attack

468
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:16,150
the recovery of query keywords doesn't

469
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,908
actually rely on the leakage of whether

470
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,760
a document matches a particular query

471
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if even if hypothetically all of my</font>

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,010

473
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,570
storage or PIR the the query keywords

474
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,780
would still be recoverable using this

475
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,809
attack and this is this is the several

476
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,600
points I'll say it again the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

477
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,020
the basic compromising confidentiality

478
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,939
here is simple if I share a document a

479
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,879
single document with a friend who I

480
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,649
trust who is later compromised then all

481
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my private documents are compromised</font>

482
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:51,870
as well

483
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,030
there is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> act of attack discussed in</font>

484
00:19:51,870 --> 00:20:01,709
the mylar paper and this is this is the

485
00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:05,040
text of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack the the attack</font>

486
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,660
basically relies on inserting a pre

487
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,570
computed brute force dictionary into the

488
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,790
system and relies on the leakage of

489
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,580
whether a query matches a certain

490
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:17,309
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword our</font>

491
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,540
attack in contrast doesn't require there

492
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,450
to be a dictionary document on the

493

<font color="#E5E5E5">server we can recover search query</font>

494
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,309
keywords that don't occur in any

496
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:34,830
the victim even if the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

497
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,139
shares a document with the adversary the

498
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,970
collusion allowed by the the mylar

499
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,720
active threat model will still allow you

500
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,910
to recover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contents of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the documents</font>

501
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,900
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion the security of low</font>

502
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:51,510
pets is still pretty poorly understood

503
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,520
metadata in BO pets can leak information

504
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,790
and violate the confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

505
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,530
encrypted data access patterns on the

506
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,920
data do as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> see our paper for</font>

507
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,980
this the active adversary in BO pets is

508
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,230
very powerful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

509
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,000
operation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perform can be</font>

510
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,429
performed maliciously so you need some

511
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,590
kind of way to verify that that's only

512
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:16,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only doing what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted to do</font>

513
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,149
and nothing more so in a good

integrating property reviewing

confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is still pretty</font>

518
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,740
tricky and active attacks on Bo pets are

519
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,840
still an unresolved challenge in

520
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,210
literature so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope to motivate more</font>

521
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,889
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that as well I think the</font>

522
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,890
conducts it so thank you everybody

523
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:55,830
ok questions for Pope we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we have</font>

524
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:57,960
time just a quick clarification so in my

525
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,970
large you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just see wet weather or</font>

526
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,919
search term matches you get to see where

527
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,059
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document it matches and so you're</font>

528
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,099
covering words or well in mylar doesn't

529
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,220
actually randomize the order of the the

530
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,168
encrypted key words so you recover more

531
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,659
than whether it matches you recover the

532
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:18,029
order of the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document it</font>

533
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,249
modulo some kind of deduplication of the

534
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,899
keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they only they don't</font>

535
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:24,389
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> store words with multiplicity</font>

536
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,609
they only store it like the unique key

537
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:28,619
words in the document but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still see</font>

538
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,299
you can still see the order of the

539
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">keywords and that could potentially</font>

540
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,950
enable more more devastating kind of

541
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">frequency analysis tax that are just</font>

542
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,119
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> search leakage and not on</font>

543
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,889
this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> prayer recovery leakage and</font>

544
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,699
so your number for the seventy percent

545
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:46,949
that's the number of lines in the chat

546
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,779
log where all the terms get recovered

547
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,029
well it's the number of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

548
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,859
keywords so like we take we take like

549
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:55,619
the number of like the number of words

550
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,119
in all the chats and then like the

551
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:02,158
number of words we recover and then it's

552
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:04,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we just divide those two so</font>

553
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have a commons in the question the</font>

554
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,529
comment is just I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

555
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are searchable encryption</font>

556
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:12,960
schemes that do not rely on property

557
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,908
preserving encryption and in some cases

558
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,830
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be used in the real world and</font>

559
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,419
still need to be analyzed as more work

560
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,389
to do but I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

561
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but can you be more specific yes</font>

562
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:28,439
like the there is a work by the IBM team

563
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:30,299
which is called oxt a spear search for

564
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">private search and there's work like</font>

565
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:36,779
columbia and the lab called blind seer

566
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,759
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe this is just it's</font>

567
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,249
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to your talk it's nice it's</font>

568
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,779
ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time the definitional</font>

569
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:44,340
thing but that that work will be

570
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,559
included under property revealing

571
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,570
encryption no it doesn't use the

572
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,908
terminus to conclude it doesn't use this

573
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,330
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> use deterministic encryption</font>

574
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:55,090
on well neither neither does my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Largo ok</font>

575
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,360
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

576
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,129
we talked online<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes my gosh what about</font>

577
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,040
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in your passive</font>

578
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,560
attack is it easy to solve it by just

579
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,300
encrypting the data in some way or does

580
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it ruin everything it does but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

581
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,409
there's a kind of a usability question

582
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,090
there because when you do a share you

583
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,530
want the user to be able to see what's

584
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,360
being shared with it before the user

585
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,430
accepts the share so there it almost

586
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,620
creates like a chicken and egg problem

587
