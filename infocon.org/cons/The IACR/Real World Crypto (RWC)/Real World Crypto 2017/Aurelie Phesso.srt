again in order to have better accuracy

206
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:38,469
important is that this rod or lose to

thanks for your talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide six if you</font>

217
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:30,829
can quickly sackless are ya so you have

218
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,290
your list of things you need to satisfy

219
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,910
here and you have privacy in one

220
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,730
direction but not the other direction

221
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,770
and it's actually tricky to define what

222
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would mean by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy in the other</font>

223
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,160
direction right so you have no

224
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,279
requirement that the client doesn't

225
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,949
learn the model for example so a trivial

226
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,950
solution is just than the classifier to

227
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,710
the client and have the client do it

228
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:58,610
obviously you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but</font>

229
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:01,130
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client has allowed to give data</font>

230
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,920
and get classifications out the client

231
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,890
can learn the model itself so what

232
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:19,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually is the privacy requirement in</font>

233
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:24,020
that of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction so again you</font>

234
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,410
replace again my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here's</font>

235
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,810
a simple protocol the server just sends

236
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,079
the client and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> model I'm the client</font>

237
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:43,640
just runs it itself right why is that

238
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:45,110
not what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do from what I</font>

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,420
understood based on Krypton it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

240
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,180
they also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide the model right</font>

241
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,849
so I mean it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stated requirement</font>

242
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,069
here but if you want to hide the model

243
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,830
you have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if the client</font>

244
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,480
can just submit arbitrary things and get

245
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,990
classifications that the client can

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:07,490
learn the model itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> identically right</font>

247
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,380
just like just by using so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

248
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,430
is the requirement the unstated

249
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,430
requirement is my

250
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,030
so you mean by adaptively acquiring<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

251
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:24,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">times yeah yes that will be dependent</font>

252
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,390
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that's the MPC definition</font>

253
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,550
and it doesn't thank you try to address

254
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,040
that right so whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you learn from</font>

255
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,729
the outputs<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many outputs it's fair</font>

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">game right</font>

257
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i/o is the function</font>

258
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:53,529
right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the last example that</font>

259
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,939
we showed where you can support<font color="#E5E5E5"> 17k</font>

262
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:05,769
have to evaluate and what parameters did

265
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:36,369
returned it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have to</font>
