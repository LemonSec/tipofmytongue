<font color="#CCCCCC">q so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about signal and</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,830
hopefully the provable security

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:18,660
guarantees of the signal protocol could

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:20,160
either slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so we just had a</font>

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,150
challenges in building a protocol that

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,640
can have strong security guarantees as

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,769
well as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> usability and open with the</font>

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,199
protocol and before the lunch break we

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,730
heard from John Millikan at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook how</font>

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,309
signal is being used in the real world

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,578
so John was talking about how facebook

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,129
Messenger has the optional feature for

15
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,649
secret conversations which is enter end

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,149
encrypted in facebook Messenger with

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,390
signal so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know how signal is designed</font>

18
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,399
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source and we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,840
it's being used in the real world but

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,760
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's secure where's the</font>

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,659
proof and that's what this work aim is

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,330
to investigate in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font>

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,830
important problem because signal is used

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,320
by default in whatsapp as Thomas<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

25
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,289
its youth in facebook Messenger Google a

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,740
low are using also optionally you can

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,960
encrypt with signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use what's that</font>

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,600
personally I'm sure many people in the

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,179
audience use what's there for signal and

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,220
so essentially the user base is millions

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,320
of people and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite surprising</font>

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,380
then that in our community there hasn't

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,250
actually been any publications analyzing

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,020
the provable security guarantees of the

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,290
underlying key exchange mechanism of

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,298
signal and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sort of hole in</font>

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,290
our theoretical understanding that we

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,110
need to remedy and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we set</font>

39
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,840
out to investigate so the team are

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,539
following people so on the left are the

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,159
professor's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bosses and on the right</font>

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,899

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to discuss</font>

52
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,700
it in some detail much also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a player</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

53
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,549
some really productive discussions with

54
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,280
Trevor Perrin so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very appreciative</font>

55
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:40,900
for that as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that in mind</font>

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,090
what should they can all achieve and

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,269
doesn't mean its goals that's really

58
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,010
what we're aiming to investigate so

59
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,079
usual things that we can model for

60
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,510
cryptographic protocols are things like

61
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:56,530
we assume it should be secure if the

62
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,790
adversary is a network attacker can be a

63
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's easy to model</font>

64
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,879
signal explicitly<font color="#E5E5E5"> describes itself in</font>

65
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,250
its documentation as a protocol with

66
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,170
forward secrecy so check we can model

67
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well there are other things too</font>

68
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,640
so if one message key is compromised

69
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,739
that shouldn't necessarily mean other

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,230
message keys are compromised these are

71
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">all good security properties the model</font>

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,488
and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in other</font>

73
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,500
protocols so that's encouraging it means

74
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,819
we could possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it the signal but</font>

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interesting thing about signal is</font>

76
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,780
that it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually achieve another</font>

77
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,129
security property a very novel strong

78
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,819
security property known as post

79
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,709
compromise security the post come to my

80
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,069
security the intuition behind this

81
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,019
concept it's a sort of recovering from

82
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromise and so I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the</font>

83
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">next few slides explaining what this</font>

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,519
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept is in more detail and</font>

85
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,060
then I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

86
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">very useful and how it applies to signal</font>

87
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,410
so what post compromise security it

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,910
makes sense to look at what forward

89
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,489
secrecy is so this is a picture we're

90
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,489
all familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if time is only</font>

91
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:05,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">x-axis going from left to right a</font>

92
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,530
forward secrecy is that you have your

93
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,599
session represented by this padlock and

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,699
then after your session is over

95
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,510
something bad could happen represented

96
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:19,000
by the orange egg explosion so if you

97
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,560
have compromised so absent Bob have

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,530
their session and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on their</font>

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,330
long-term keys are compromised

100
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,979
forward secrecy says that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

101
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,710
you had in the past it should still be

102
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,550
safe we're all familiar of this concept

103
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,979
so post compromise security by contrast

104
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,080
looks like this in some sense are these

105
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,750
sort of opposite situation but it's

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,300
actually it seems a lot worse because

107
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,460
now the compromise happens and then you

108
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,530
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a secure session and this</font>

109
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,169
goes against<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thumb cryptographic</font>

110
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,359
folklore in some sense because if alice

111
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,669
is trying to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Bob and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font>

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term private key is already</font>

113
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:02,450
compromised say the NSA or e knows Bob's

114
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,480
long-term private key how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> alice be</font>

115
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:09,200
sure she's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Bob and not the</font>

116
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,540
NSA and the answer is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,630
achieve security even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case by</font>

118
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,930
sharing state so imagine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alison</font>

119
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,719
bulbs not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanged messages and 50</font>

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,540
Hellman values in each session to drive

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,720
message keys or session Keys but also

122
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,930
that they share a symmetric key which

123
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,660
lasts across sessions and their update

124
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,970
and evolves with new keying material as

125
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,250
Alice and Bob communicate so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trevor</font>

126
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,050
was talking about with this

127
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,240
diffie-hellman<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping-pong is that as</font>

128
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alice and Bob send each other</font>

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,320
diffie-hellman messages so Alice will

130
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,090
send a diff ahem ratchet key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

131
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,219
Bob will do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> and analysis and</font>

132
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,820
another one they're continually updating

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,830
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> route key which is this symmetric</font>

134
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,020
key that continually evolves and updates

135
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,180
of new keying material and the root key

136
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,340
and signal ultimately corresponds and

137
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,919
all ultimately is used to derive a

138
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,349
message keys and so although they may be

139
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,870
compromised at one point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time this</font>

140
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,160
root key could change and evolve and so

141
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,830
Alice and Bob could in some sense

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,190
recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this compromise that's what</font>

143
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,650
post compromise security is about um so

144
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,640
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this useful it's question and it</font>

145
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,469
makes sense to look at three<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

146
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,180
older protocols have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no forward secrecy</font>

147
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,669
so think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective for the</font>

148
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,640
adversary life is pretty easy because

149
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:35,599
the adversary can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> passive and all</font>

150
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,260
secrets depend on one key so PTP or TLS

151
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,630
is our essay has this problem

152
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,030
so the adversary can prove reply to text

153
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,820
traffic and then if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeps a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,770

155
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,810
key of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server if that key is</font>

156
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,880
compromised then all communications at

157
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past present and future also</font>

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,820
compromised newer protocols have forward

159
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,330
secrecy there's a big push to have TLS

160
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">1.3 to have forward secrecy so you do</font>

161
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,780
City Hellman ephemeral keys for instance

162
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,850
and lie<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the adversary is therefore a</font>

163
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,710
bit more difficult because now the

164
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,780
adversary has to compromise a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term</font>

165
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,270
key and then also be an active man in

166
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,640
the middle but consider protocols with

167
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,469
post compromise security<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

168
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,969
adversary is extremely difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

169
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,640
now the adversary has to compromise

170
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,880
Alice or Bob and then attack immediately

171
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,219
and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack because Alice's</font>

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,310
and bulbs shared state continually

173
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,470
evolves so good analogy is that they

174
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,630
they're changing the locks in fact quite

175
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,290
literally they're changing the locks so

176
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,570
the adversary may know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root key this</font>

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,710
shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> state at one point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font>

178
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,840
because Allison called plays

179
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,239
diffie-hellman<font color="#CCCCCC"> ping pong and this their</font>

180
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,700
state continually changes the adversary

181
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,140
may be locked out in the future so life

182
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,550
of the adversaries a lot more difficult

183
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,210
for protocol has post compromised

184
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,250
security and this is an earlier paper

185
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,650
called on post<font color="#CCCCCC"> cog remote security that</font>

186
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,660
we got into CSS and it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

188
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,070

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">although we're investigating signal this</font>

190
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,630
is a formally defined notion of security

191
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,909
in a game based definition and it could

192
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,520
possibly apply to any any number of

193
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,650
protocols so that's what I wanted to say

194
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,120
about post compromise security now<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

195
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,830
talk about signal um so our security

196
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,020
model is based on Isabella<font color="#CCCCCC"> raag waste</font>

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">our model so it's a computational model</font>

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">multistage key exchange models because</font>

200
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:41,400
signal has a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different keys a lot</font>

femoral keys ratchet keys and so

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different stages to consider</font>

205
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so the reason why there hasn't been</font>

206
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,200
many publications analyzing the security

207
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,420
of signal is because up until recently

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there just wasn't a model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

209
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,110
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol like signal so what</font>

210
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">is our model capture in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world</font>

211
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,480
while going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to our checklist we can</font>

212
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,920
model a network attacker that's good one

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,920
my can intercept a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mammal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle at any</font>

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,160
time we also model a perfect forward

215
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,019
secrecy so we allow the adversary to

216
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,360
conversation between Alice and Bob and

217
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,630
then compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allison</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob's long-term</font>

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,589
comprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> personation attacks so we</font>

220
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,959
allow the adversary to compromise

221
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alice's long-term key and then try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

222
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:40,319
impersonate another party to Alice we

223
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,810
also capture a very fine-grained form of

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,149
bad random number<font color="#E5E5E5"> generators so as I was</font>

225
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,010
saying signal uses medium term keys and

226
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,110
ephemeral keys and ratchet keys the

227
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,149
signal uses a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of random numbers and</font>

228
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,980
so it's conceivable that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

229
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:56,430
combinations of random numbers can be

230
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,110
bad and some can be good and maybe in

231
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,180
certain situations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still have a</font>

232
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,310
security guarantee so we allow a very

233
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,229
fine-grained very strong notion of bad

234
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,380
random number generators a bad random

235
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,820
number modeling I me also captured this

236
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,740
strong property of post compromise

237
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,320
security and signals the first protocol

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real world protocol that can</font>

239
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,860
be proven<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this property and so</font>

240
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,060
our theorem is a theorem based on the

241
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,850
random Oracle<font color="#E5E5E5"> model in the gap CT</font>

242
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,920
Hammond assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a game</font>

243
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proofs which means we start from</font>

244
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">our original security game and we can we</font>

245
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,089
consider similar games and similar games

246
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,279
until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually end up with games</font>

247
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,980
that clearly the adversary cannot win

248
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,220
and we use this to bound the probability

249
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,360
that the adversary will win the original

250
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,089
security game which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we define</font>

251
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,220
security and we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well clearly because</font>

252
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,660
these games are similar in some sense we

253
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,250
can bound the probabilities episode

254
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,040
winning and say that it's negligible and

255
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,470
our proof tree unfortunately looks like

256
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
this which is quite intimidating but

257
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,220
actually our proof isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

258
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,930
complicated it's just them we have to

259
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,690
partition over lots of different cases

260
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,520
that's why our tree is so low

261
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,680
because as I was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> though signals a</font>

262
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,390
multi-stage key exchange protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

263
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,540
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of keys and differences</font>

264
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,880
of stages so we have to partition over

265
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,849
adversarial behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> but actually a lot</font>

266
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cases in our proof are all</font>

267
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,960
analogous<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other and so although</font>

268
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,510
our proof is long it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

269
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,610
complicated and hopefully it's not too

270
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:31,100
difficult to read that said this isn't a

271
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,050
stamp saying signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with secure signals</font>

272
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,640
perfect there are some limitations to

273
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:40,060
our work so an interesting story is that

274
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,170
when we publish this paper we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

275
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,420
ePrint which is the international

276
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:48,310
association of cryptographic research

277
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,380
and so that when the register and other

278
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,900
news organizations wrote about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

279
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,270
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said the IAC r has verified the</font>

280
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,740
security of signal which is a like no no

281
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,689
we don't whatever work so that we don't

282
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,640
represent<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sticky on eep</font>

283
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,380

any<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> statuses directly from</font>

285

286
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,370
it's um but anyway we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

287
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,110
signals perfect anyway so analysis is

288
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,360
limited in some sense so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font>

289
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,000
we're considering a theoretical analysis

290
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,240
of the core of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol so we're not</font>

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,950
considering what's app or Google ello or

292
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,330
Facebook which is good at some sense

293
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,010
because that means our work is generic

294
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,990
but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we're not giving a</font>

295
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,390
precise we didn't look at precisely one

297
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,990
because it will have slightly different

298
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:38,060
implementations another technical point

299
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:40,100
is that in signal there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> medium term</font>

300
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,869
key which is signed by a long term key

301
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,640
and also the long term key is used in

302
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,830
tiffin Hellman key exchange which makes

303
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,720
our proof even more long and complicated

304
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,630
so for simplicity's sake we just assumed

305
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are that the evidence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MK is</font>

306

308
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,210
usually what happens is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

309
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,069
compare safety numbers for our purposes

310
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,080
we just assumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> key distribution of</font>

than perfect forward secrecy just

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,140
because I agree if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually I see to</font>

be honest first person it is my personal

opinion I don't might be the name

355
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,800
forward secrecy i think it's not clear I

356
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,589
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> content like post compromise</font>

357
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,089
security is it's not ambiguous or its

358
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,350
forward secrecy you could easily argue

359
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,959
it could should be called<font color="#CCCCCC"> backward</font>

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">secrecy or something and so I think you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know yeah i agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah i agree i said</font>

you mentioned formal security for me

379
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,220
formal implies the users here improver
