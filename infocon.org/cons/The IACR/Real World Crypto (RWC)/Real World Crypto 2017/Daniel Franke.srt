00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
right so hi I'm Daniel<font color="#E5E5E5"> Franco from</font>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">Akamai and today I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be talking</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,550
about cryptographic security for MTP so

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,500
for starters MTP who cares well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font>

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,240
to thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> the anonymous reviewer who</font>

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,369
recommended that this talk be accepted

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,830
and succinctly hit the nail on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> head</font>

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,619
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer to that question MTP</font>

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,509
itself is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high proton high-profile</font>

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,920
Network protocol but it does underpin

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,060
pretty much everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and that</font>

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,050
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an important target for</font>

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,329
scrutiny well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is everything else</font>

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,309
well a lot take this list with a grain

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,170
of salt I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few of these</font>

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,059
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> up top my head a lot of a lot</font>

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,329
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them come from graphing the</font>

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,839
corpus of RFC's for the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp</font>

19
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,950
so there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i left out</font>

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,270
apparently we can now add<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns to that</font>

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,059
list and but this stuff is mostly boring

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean x509 is mostly just used for TLS</font>

23
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,570
and who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that so let's talk</font>

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">about something interesting instead</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:05,729
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sharks so a few years</font>

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago there was a biology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grad student at</font>

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,850
UCSD who was tracking the migrations of

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,798
a school of great white shark his team

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,179
had tagged the shorts with GPS trackers

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,159
which were periodically sending

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,640
timestamp location data to a server in

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,619
their lab unfortunately that servers MTP

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,770
demon was misbehaving and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result</font>

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,509
its clock was fast now as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as anybody</font>

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,939
knows this was not the result of an

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,770
attack maybe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bog maybe was Miss</font>

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,329
configuration maybe there's a problem

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,339
def stream servers I don't think anybody

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever got to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of that but</font>

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,049
anyway as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its clock being</font>

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,779
fast the tracking program saw 50 data it

42
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,610
was receiving was old so it applied dead

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,610
reckoning to we infer the Sharks current

44
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,130
position this place to the Sharks jumped

45
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,100
them if you will just<font color="#CCCCCC"> offshore of a</font>

46
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,009
popular beach<font color="#CCCCCC"> d grabs couldn't seize</font>

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,408
this and leaping into action phones up

48
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,090
his friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lifeguard mass panic</font>

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,369
predictably ensues the beach gets

50
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,560
evacuated and shut down until<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time</font>

51
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,950
later when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very embarrassed grad</font>

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,899
student realizes his mistake so the

53
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,730
moral of the story is that when you

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,710
think of MTP don't just think of your

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,350
common desktop app

56
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,580
don't just think of your TLS server

57
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,829
don't just think of high<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency</font>

58
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,870
trading there are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

59
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,840
depend on mt p then are dreamt of in

60
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,950
your philosophy and when it breaks it

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,900
can break in some very surprising ways

62
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,280
so having established the importance of

63
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrity of our system clock it</font>

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,510
follows that we'd like our ntp data to

65
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:38,000
be authenticated and here's what's

66
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,640
available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that today so the</font>

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,660
overwhelming majority of the ntp users

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,899
are running it without any

69
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,579
authentication at all and the few of you

70
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,030
in this audience who are an exception

71
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,040
you know who you are MTP does support

72
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">asymmetric authentication mode which</font>

73
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,230
basically just text on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac on the end</font>

74
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,000
of every packet it's somewhat broken but

75
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the more important issue is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,930
symmetric it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful to you if</font>

77
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arranged in advance to share a</font>

key with your server operator and

79
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,620
obviously this doesn't scale the real

world deployment finally MTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports</font>

81
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,410
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called auto key which is an</font>

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,950
attempt of supporting public key

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:18,859
authentication but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will return to</font>

84
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,470
in a bit it is thoroughly broken to

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,410
using auto key you should stop now

<font color="#E5E5E5">before I venture any further into the</font>

weeds of ntp authentication schemes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

90
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,299
going to need to explain a bit about how

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">MTP works this is a topic which could</font>

92
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,130
easily fill a college semester but here

93
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a super abridged version with just</font>

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,269
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> information so you can follow the</font>

95
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,060
rest of this talk so here on the slide

96
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,770
you see an<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP packet header this header</font>

97
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,110
can be followed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by some expansion fields</font>

98
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,670
and then buy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac but in most usage not</font>

99
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,700
the one is present so this header is the

100
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,019
entire packet the four fields that are

101
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,980
interesting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes are</font>

algorithm involves<font color="#E5E5E5"> four time stamps</font>

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,380
which I played out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here there's also a</font>

106
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,359
fifth one the reference time stamp but

107
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,820
for today's purposes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can ignore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

108
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these four time stamps represents a</font>

109
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,529
chronological sequence of events request

115
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,500
client when the response arrives so

116
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,500
given these four timestamps there are a

117
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,050
few important values we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can compute one</font>

118
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,820
is the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> round-trip time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 minus</font>

121
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,419
time the server spent processing it so

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,530
subtract that part out and you're left

123
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,409
with just the time due to network

124
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,080
latency the statistic we really care

125
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about though here is theta which</font>

126
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,950
represents the offset between the

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">server's clock in the clients clock we</font>

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,760
can estimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> cita as I've shown here but</font>

129
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,010
this equation incorporates a key

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,349
assumption which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network latency</font>

131
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,120
is symmetrical in other words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

132
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,520
requested in our response each took the

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,479
same amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cross the network</font>

134
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,000
of course no<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter how good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,950
authentication scheme is it's quite

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible for a network adversary to mess</font>

137
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,150
with this assumption by delaying packets

138
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,160
in one direction but not in the other so

139
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,450
here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this lambda statistic which</font>

140
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,850
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the synchronization</font>

141
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,890
distance which basically represents our

142
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,740
maximum error represents how far off or

143
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,650
estimate might get as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of this</font>

144
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,910
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first term here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta over 2</font>

145
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,789

minor sources of error one thing that

150
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes into epsilon is that our clock get</font>

151
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,460

159
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,680
dominates this equation even if you're

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,280
running over a fast land and epsilon is

161
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,130
pretty insignificant so moving on to the

290
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,660
there is no magic solution here that

<font color="#E5E5E5">will be able to achieve by avoiding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls</font>

292
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,910
the best we can do is to reject any time

these two on these certificates server

299
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,990

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> handing us an expired certificate</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the third we can mitigate against</font>

303
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,660
just by querying multiple servers and

304
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,280
then rejecting any outliers which is

306
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,250
has for a long time a third objection is

307
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,189
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls can't deal with broadcast mode</font>

308
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,170
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true enough but I have a really</font>

simple answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one which is don't</font>

310
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,510
use broadcast mode there is it was just

311
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,580
there's just no good motivation for it

312
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we come to an objection that</font>

313

can't be dismissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so easily which is</font>

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important to allow ntp</font>

315
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,190
servers to be stateless and let's talk

316
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,340
about why this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is MTP scales a lot</font>

317
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,720
differently than say web server does any

318
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,870
given client generates very little

319
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,250
traffic not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per hour</font>

320
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,890
but ntp servers typically serve a

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,510
massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of clients we're talking</font>

322
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,890
to where we may be talking tens of

323
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,470
millions in some cases like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nist</font>

324
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,060

325
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,380
hold even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small amount of state for</font>

326
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,180
every client that has a session<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

327
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,740
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come under memory</font>

328
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,760
pressure long before we come under cpu

329
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,870
pressure so with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said let's</font>

367
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,000
much suits our needs perfectly the spec

368
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,969
for how to do this is literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

of paragraphs but for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-server</font>

mode which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what virtually everybody</font>

371
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,850
actually uses we need to do a little bit

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work now we can still do an</font>

unmodified TLS handshake this will

374
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">require the server to hold state for one</font>

which can be days which can be days or

381
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,480
weeks or months then that's acceptable

382
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,100
maybe in that case even an impossibly

going to cut it so here's our solution

388
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,209
for clients for remote we do a TLS

389
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,760
handshake on a separate port after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

390

391
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,140
application data to negotiate an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AED</font>

392
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,380
algorithm and to send the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clients a</font>

393
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,420
supply of cookies now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice of a</font>

394
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,350
EAD algorithms is a little bit delicate

395
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,280
here because in some deployments

396
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,850
particularly ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> involve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> load</font>

retain anything in the interim also just

421
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,369
like TLS session tickets there's a

422
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,860
privacy problem here if the quiet comes

423
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,570
back the cookie multiple times then that

424
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,540
will enable a passive adversary to track

425

the client as it moves between networks

426
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,839

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,820
but then sent back in the clear so the

431
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,980
adversary won't be able to link the two

432
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,530
legs<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the transaction this is</font>

433
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,340
perfectly analogous to how TLS 1.3 deals

434
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:44,319
with session tickets but supporting news

435
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,880
privacy goals in mts is a little

436
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,150
pointless if they're being violated at

437
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,270
the MTP layer and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that well I'll</font>

438
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:55,209
let this slide speak for itself since

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,209
both respectively first for for pushing

442
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,770
us to get to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work done and to</font>

446
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,530
wrap up this talk with a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> shout-out</font>

447
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,880
for rough time which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate</font>

448
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,149
effort that Adam Langley is in

449
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,320
spearheading now rough time is not ntp

450
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,600
at all it's a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

451
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,310
protocol different goals and as its name

00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,679
implies<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-precision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not one of</font>

453
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,050
those goals what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> provides some</font>

454
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,050
exchange is better ability to ensure the

455
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,450
servers are behaving correctly now all

456
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,860
along MTP has supported the ability to

457
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,490
weed out servers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving that</font>

458
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,899
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so-called fall stickers from any</font>

459
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,910
majority collective so-called through

<font color="#CCCCCC">Chalmers</font>

461
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,990
but the limitation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp whether you're</font>

462
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,050
securing it with NTS or with any of the

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">legacy authentication mechanisms is that</font>

464
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,070
conversation transcripts are reputable

465
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,990
so the client won't be able to prove to

466
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,879
a third party that the fall stickers are

467
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,850
false ticking and that's what rough time

468
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,070
solves and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can ever get to the</font>

469
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,459
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the usual behavior for</font>

470
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,100
clients is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they first set their</font>

471
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,600
time using rough time and then then do

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine tuning using mts</font>

473

authenticated ntp that would be a very

474
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,309
nice world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope we get there in</font>

475
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,740
the next few years so with that I'll

476
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:31,530
wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and take questions</font>

477
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:35,260
[Applause]

478
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

479
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:47,919
of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have I am I just wanted</font>

480
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge other people that have</font>

481
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,059
been working on this design on the

482
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,410
dimension on the slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

483
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole bunch of people actually working</font>

484
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,140
on me from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF so I just wanted to</font>

485
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention some of their names have been</font>

486
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,350
doing some of this work so there's

487
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:02,799
Harlan's then there's Danny mayor and

488
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,939
Miroslav look far orig faults I just

489
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,970
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure i get everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kyle</font>

490
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,409
rose me until<font color="#CCCCCC"> mehrotra and i hope i</font>

491
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,360
didn't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else so it's</font>

492
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:12,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a big team and all of the stuff</font>

493
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,719
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening now so it'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very very</font>

494
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,460
exciting to get input from this

495
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,780
Community on this work so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

496
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,919
glad that Daniel got the chance to

497
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:26,289
present this work you write thank you

498
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:28,120
yes I there there are ya as ethical

499
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,710
board mentioned there's there's actually

500
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,399
quit there's quite a cast who's been

501
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,659
involved with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit here so I</font>

502
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,370
can't come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them off the</font>

503
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">top my head either look for the</font>

504
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,559
contributors section at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

505
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,419
draft you are mentioning that this is

506
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected to DNS SEC one thing I'm</font>

507
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,289
observing is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people seem</font>

508
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,719
to sign their DNS SEC records or for a

509
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,370
year in some cases i find this somewhat

510
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,280
surprising just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

511
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice state gov is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issuing one year the</font>

512
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:04,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">nsx signatures seems a little long for</font>

513
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:04,140
most purposes so don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thank you</font>

514
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:17,100
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really too slow to just sign the</font>

515
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:17,100
responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> i yes ok</font>

516
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,870
something that is this something at the

517
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,640
NTP pool can use or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

518
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,830
administratively prohibitive for them to

519
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,510
use it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's something that</font>

520
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,449
we're still in the very early phases of

521
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,520
addressing by early phases i mean i sent

522
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">one email about that out to the working</font>

523
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">group list and i haven't heard any</font>

524
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,590
responses yet but yeah having this

525
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,520
having this supported by pool servers is

526
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,790
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

527
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,950
challenging than if you've that then if

528
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,820
you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've specifically configured</font>

529
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:00,100
what servers you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to because</font>

530
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:06,129
it will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> require some some means</font>

531
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:09,730
of of having somebody who who owns a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA</font>

532
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,670
private key that you thought who's that

533
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,920
you trust and having them basically a

534
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:19,540
credit people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you crossed to serve</font>

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you valid time so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is again</font>

536
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,070
something that that I hope rough<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

537
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,320
can help us<font color="#CCCCCC"> with because that will help</font>

538
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,629
us spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> people whose a credit whose</font>

539
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,200
accreditations accreditation needs to go

540
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,830
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

541
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,830
much an open problem

542
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:49,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay alright so let's thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel game</font>
