1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,760
please you're good to start the

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,720
session enjoy

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
right okay welcome to day three of world

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,639
crypto 2021

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
everybody um my name is tyler and i have

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
the pleasure of sharing the next two

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
sessions which will both be invited

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,439
talks on

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,240
contact tracing um i think it's fair to

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
say that this last year has been very

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,880
challenging

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
and it's going to be great to hear about

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
how people from our community have been

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
contributing to solutions for the covert

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
pandemic

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
now before we kick off i'd just like to

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
remind you please put your questions in

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,760
zooloop

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
and i will try to monitor them there

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
also please remember to adhere to our

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
code of conduct

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
and also keep yourself muted during the

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
talks

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
so first up we're going to have carmela

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
trancoso comedo is the head of the

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
spring lab at epfl which is focused on

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
security and privacy research

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
carmella's group has been heavily

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,559
involved in the design of the

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,320
decentralized privacy preserving

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
proximity tracing or dp3t

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
solution which is at the core of the

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,040
swiss covert app

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
um carmilla's group definitely does very

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
impactful and engaging research and

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
she's recently let me know that she's

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
looking for crypto focused phds and

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
postdocs so do reach out to carmilla

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,920
but with that i'll leave it to you

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,640
carmela take it away thank you very much

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
uh so let me do again the fancy

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
sharing here

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,640
okay so here i am at the bottom of the

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
slide uh my name is carmela and as

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
tyler was saying i want to talk nothing

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
about the crypto side of developing

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
these but really about

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,880
the privacy engineering process and how

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,079
we did or we suffered from theory to

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
practice and a lot of things that

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,560
happened

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,399
uh during the these crazy months and

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,159
just to give a bit of context in case

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,840
somebody was under a rock and never

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
heard about this

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
um this project started because

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
uh the process of tracing which is

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
something that epidemiology

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
reduced any epidemiological seasons

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,599
to try to stop um infection chains

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,520
by being able to tell in people that

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
have been close to infected people that

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,840
they are

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
at risk and therefore they should take

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
precautions not to

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
infect more people and this is typically

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
done manually meaning that there is an

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,120
interview with the person

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
you ask them who were the contacts then

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
you find a way of contacting those

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
people you call them you write emails to

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
them you send sms's

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
but at the rate as coffee was growing

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
this system

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
this manual system became overwhelmed we

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
didn't have enough capacity to actually

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
call everyone or do all of the

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
interviews

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
so the need here was to to find

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
a technological solution that could

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
complement these manual people when they

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,319
get overwhelmed

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
and be able to notify users of this in

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
an automated way

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
and the the the kind of the challenges

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
to do this is they have to be a timely

87
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,560
meaning that it has to be fast one of

88
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
the problems when this gets overwhelmed

89
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
is that the price is also slow right you

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
need to go through the interview and you

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
need to call people

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
but we know that every day that someone

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
is around

94
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
uh maybe infected with covet we can have

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,080
many more infections so time is of the

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,800
essence

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
this should be efficient it should not

98
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
require more manual labor

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
than the previous

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
manual way of doing this should be

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,200
scalable

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
because if then sound that this pandemic

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,319
is not only in lausanne or in

104
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,040
switzerland

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
is a worldwide so if we put a technology

106
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,959
out there it should be able to scale

107
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
to millions and millions of users

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
and the fear that came with this thing

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
with this call of the idea that

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
we're gonna look about who's around you

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,319
who's close to you and for how long

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,519
of course that comes security and

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,080
privacy concerns and from what i see to

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
give my background the kind of things

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,080
that

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
really worried me and my group with the

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
protection from misuse we're going to be

118
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
collecting a lot of information

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
that may end up being surveillance

120
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,640
infrastructure

121
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
that may be used to manipulate and

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
modify

123
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
the behavior of some people and may be

124
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,840
also used

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
to target the most vulnerable

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
so we wanted to build something with the

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
purpose of the application

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
is limited by default technologically

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
and

130
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
a kind of time give us a bit of reasons

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
because if you have followed the news in

132
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,479
the last month since this kind of

133
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,759
applications have been out there and

134
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,479
since we

135
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
actually have massive concentration you

136
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,919
find news

137
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,320
in which we see how the information

138
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,759
collected for tracing

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
is being misused by people like

140
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
bartenders that use this information

141
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
to harass the clients by the police that

142
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
asked for these records for

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
investigations

144
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
and we just learned a couple of weeks

145
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,919
ago that in singapore

146
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,919
that has one of these applications the

147
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
information collected the application is

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
actually made available to the police

149
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
whenever they have the need for an um

150
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
for an investigation so these are the

151
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,479
kind of things that we're going to avoid

152
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,080
and also want to notice that even though

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
in the beginning

154
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
the big tank said no we will never do an

155
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
app we will always have a protocol

156
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
and we don't want to know anything about

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
it halfway through the process they

158
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
actually built an app

159
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,280
which means that any data that we would

160
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,199
in principle think that it is safe in

161
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
the hands of governments because we

162
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,479
trust governments

163
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
parentheses maybe we don't trust as much

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
big tech so it was very important that

165
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,840
from the beginning this technology that

166
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
we're going to ask

167
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
millions and millions of people to put

168
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
in their pockets to help

169
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,919
society get out of the pandemic was

170
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,080
actually protective

171
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
and because we know the kind of

172
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
information that typically is used

173
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
for um for this kind of misuses

174
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
we wanted to hide user's identity so the

175
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
system should not record who is there

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
their location and also their behavior

177
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
the social graph

178
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
right we have learned already that we

179
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
killed people

180
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
based on metadata and why did you get

181
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,080
about content when you just want to know

182
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
who talks to whom

183
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
so we also didn't want to reveal who is

184
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
standing by whom

185
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,919
by definition in this kind of system and

186
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,080
of course we also need the security side

187
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
right we need to make sure that the

188
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
system only gives

189
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
good alarms like meaning that if you

190
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
receive an alert

191
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,199
you actually should have been with um

192
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,800
people that have been infected

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
and we want to avoid denial of service

194
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
try to make a system for millions of

195
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,919
people but then they cannot use it the

196
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,919
system is of no use whether it's privacy

197
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
preserving

198
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
and that was fine that's the kind of

199
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,840
thing that

200
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
i would have known typically in my

201
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
research but there was another hidden

202
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,639
constraint that i had

203
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
not really confronted before and i guess

204
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
that many people in our community have

205
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,560
not

206
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
this research this this constraint is

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,639
called reality and it is out there

208
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,160
and it means that when you develop

209
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,840
something for the world you actually

210
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,319
have

211
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,560
to do it and the constraints of the

212
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
infrastructure that we have

213
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
and one of the things that we said we

214
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
need highly scalability i said before

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
we wanted the system that would work at

216
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,560
national and

217
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,280
older scale and we also need reliability

218
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,039
right the system has to work and it has

219
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,840
to work

220
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
very fast because the pandemic was here

221
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
when we started working on this we

222
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
wanted this thing to just be out in the

223
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
first meeting i was invited

224
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
to talk about this kind of projects i

225
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
was told that we needed to have an app

226
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
the full app

227
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,199
out in three weeks three weeks like not

228
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,599
even

229
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,199
like there was no paper i have ever

230
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
written that that's pure theory or

231
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
anything that just took three weeks

232
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
left alone build the full system so we

233
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
had a lot of time pressure

234
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
and that means that we needed to build

235
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
something that very fast

236
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
we could get robust verification of what

237
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
we're actually proposing

238
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
is is actually correct so we followed a

239
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
lot the kiss principle that probably

240
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
everybody in this community knows

241
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
which keep it very simple it has to be

242
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
something that we can build fast we can

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,199
implement

244
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
fast we can verify the implementation we

245
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
can verify the protocol

246
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
and it may not be the most secure thing

247
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,280
that ever happened and of course if we

248
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
had three years to research about it we

249
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
would find a very cool privacy

250
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
preserving new cryptography based on it

251
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
but we need to have this out very fast

252
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,440
and we need to be able to provide

253
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
a security analysis of the pros and the

254
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
cons and just explain people what

255
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,919
they're gonna have

256
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,599
and this is actually what they should

257
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
have

258
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,800
and because we needed to go very fast we

259
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
also didn't have the time to produce new

260
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
infrastructure

261
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,960
let's build new um new networks let's

262
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,360
build

263
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
new servers let's just build devices and

264
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,759
ship them to all of the billions of

265
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,199
people in the world we needed to use

266
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
existing infrastructures

267
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
these are smartphones and at that point

268
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
uh

269
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
low energy bluetooth beacons was deemed

270
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,479
the best way

271
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
and the fact that we had to also exist

272
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
in the world as it is

273
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
it also means that we have a lot of

274
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,760
dependencies dependencies on

275
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
what this infrastructure can do and we

276
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
need to live with it

277
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
and deal with it and that is not an

278
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
option that i just write in a paragraph

279
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,080
of my paper

280
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
well i assume that this is not going to

281
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
be like that i assume that the network

282
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,519
can have so much fun with

283
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,480
i assume that the cloud is no none of

284
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,959
this

285
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
i cannot assume there is no assumption

286
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
there is only reality

287
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
and that actually influenced a lot of

288
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
our decisions and how the system was

289
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
designed in the end

290
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
and this um style was saying uh

291
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
became what it was called the

292
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
decentralized privacy

293
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,000
proximity tracing a group of uh fellow

294
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
researchers that were interested in this

295
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,200
we call it dp3t why dp3t because we are

296
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
computer scientists that we don't know

297
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
how to name things in

298
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
the way that they are sexy for people

299
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
nobody understands

300
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
why and we were working on this for like

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
uh since march and different

302
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
phases from pure design to

303
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
actually deployment and maintenance and

304
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
more things i will talk about at the end

305
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
of my talk

306
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
and the key ideas behind all of these uh

307
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
are just that we're going to use

308
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
bluetooth low energy beacons that are

309
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,959
being broadcasted and recorded by

310
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,160
devices

311
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
we want to use cryptography to enable

312
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
unlinkability so that we don't reveal

313
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,040
this

314
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
location or this social graph that we

315
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
thought it was very important

316
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,000
and we just decentralized them for the

317
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
key operations the ones that are

318
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,920
more related to this privacy properties

319
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
that we wanted to achieve

320
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
so that uh we could limit the purpose of

321
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
the application because there is no

322
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
entity in the system that actually

323
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
even has the information that they could

324
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
misuse

325
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
and with this uh we started working and

326
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
then we proposed the protocol

327
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
and i would explain to you what you do

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
but this was the theory

329
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,320
because this very soon god can answer

330
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,040
the way

331
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
because in practice we were using

332
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,399
existing infrastructure

333
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
existing infrastructure means the phone

334
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
and the moment that anyone decides that

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
they're going to do an

336
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,320
app they have to work with google and

337
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,720
apple

338
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,079
because google and apple are the ones

339
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,920
that do the operative system are the

340
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
owners of this thing

341
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
and you need them to give you permission

342
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
to use some parts

343
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
or to modify one of the things that we

344
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
needed is that these apps

345
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
that actually are going to have a lot of

346
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
traffic and beacons and in the

347
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,880
background

348
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
need to have limited use of battery and

349
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
cpu usage

350
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
that also leads the design of the

351
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
protocol has to have a limited amount of

352
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
round trips

353
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
because you cannot really afford to have

354
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,720
more of them because

355
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
the phones cannot handle it but you need

356
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,959
google and apple to be involved

357
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,640
in the fact about how we're going to use

358
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,160
bluetooth in a new way

359
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
actually this optimal use of the cpu

360
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
such it doesn't hit the battery too much

361
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
and users still like your application we

362
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
had a lot we still have a lot of

363
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
complaints that

364
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
this apps consume too much battery

365
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,399
imagine if we didn't have the

366
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
optimization that came from the fact

367
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
that google and apple

368
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,000
got involved and and help with this

369
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
it also needs to run in the background

370
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
that meant in the case of apple

371
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,560
apple needed to be involved and change

372
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
their operative system to enable this

373
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,839
they had before also for privacy reasons

374
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
that bluetooth low energy could not be

375
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
read in the background

376
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
no application could do this so if they

377
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,480
couldn't participate it would

378
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
enable this the apps would actually um

379
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,839
not work and then there was also the

380
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,079
compatibility between android and ios

381
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,720
in the early prototypes when apple still

382
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
had not enabled this we have tried a lot

383
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,440
of things

384
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,240
and we already saw that even though both

385
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
of them used ble and both of them kind

386
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
of used the standard technology

387
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
they were not so compatible they were

388
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
beacons that were lost there was a lot

389
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
of problems

390
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,639
so both of them needed to kind of agree

391
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,000
and how they were going to use this

392
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,959
thing they were going to use the

393
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,240
protocol to ensure

394
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
maximum reliability which remember was

395
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,519
one of

396
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
our constraints but that also meant

397
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
that google and apple because they are

398
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,800
the ones that

399
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
have the bottom of the stack are also

400
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,079
the ones that can

401
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,560
implement this problem and in this case

402
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
i decided to implement it and not to

403
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,800
open

404
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
and they also decided to implement the

405
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
api and this has as we will see in the

406
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,839
stock implement

407
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
implication for privacy engineering

408
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
interestingly enough

409
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
it also had huge implications for

410
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
epidemiology

411
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
and how exposure estimation was computed

412
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
because they took decisions that

413
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
actually made us

414
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
have to change and have to actually

415
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
misuse the api to do what the

416
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,079
epidemiologist

417
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,000
thought it was correct i just i don't

418
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
have the time in the talk to talk about

419
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
is happy to answer questions later

420
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
it also had implications for privacy

421
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,120
when it did not

422
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
when having internationalization they

423
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
actually mandate a series of signatures

424
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
that you need to follow and that means

425
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,839
that there are many privacy mechanisms

426
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,440
that we could not implement because

427
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
otherwise their api that didn't think

428
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,279
about any of this because they are just

429
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
thinking about the phone

430
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
would not accept half of the data around

431
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
again i don't have the time here

432
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
happy to talk after

433
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
so in practice uh the

434
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,760
key management on how this bluetooth

435
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,480
speakers was decided they google an app

436
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,040
and what they decided is that we have

437
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
the apps would create

438
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
a secret key every day and from this key

439
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,399
it would

440
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
derive what are called random

441
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,600
identifiers

442
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
rpis and that they would be broadcasting

443
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,279
and each of these rpis is short-lived

444
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
this is for unlinkability

445
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
so if you don't have the key you

446
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,120
actually cannot link

447
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,839
different rpis and whenever you see them

448
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
they are completely unlinked

449
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
i have to say as well that the fact that

450
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,480
they decided

451
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
to create a key every day also has an

452
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
impact on the privacy

453
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
implications of the system as many

454
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
people have pointed out

455
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
there is some trackability of possible

456
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
positive covert positive users

457
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
the fact that this is last for a day

458
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
that's trick ability that you have but

459
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
we didn't have any opportunity to change

460
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,800
or to not

461
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,279
change that was something that we may or

462
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
may not agree

463
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
but actually how the infrastructure was

464
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
built

465
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
mandated what would be our privacy

466
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,920
definition

467
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,399
so how does the system work all of the

468
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,000
participants in the system they have

469
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,199
their their phones the phones are

470
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,720
broadcasting these rpis

471
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
and whenever they are close enough to

472
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,279
each other they actually can't see the

473
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,240
information

474
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
and they store it on a list on the

475
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
phones whenever they see someone

476
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
if they are far enough like a and c here

477
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,440
um

478
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
they would not see each other so c would

479
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
not collect a and a could not collect c

480
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
and together with the numbers

481
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
these apps also also collect some

482
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,079
information about

483
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,240
the bluetooth power and this is kind of

484
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,759
a proxy for distance

485
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
like bluetooth power works the same as

486
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
voice volume if you're close by

487
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,639
you're gonna hear a high power the same

488
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
as if i come very close to the mic you

489
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,440
hear me

490
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
louder if i go far away you hear me less

491
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
so this is the information that you use

492
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
later on

493
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
to make exposure estimations

494
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,279
whenever one user is copied positive

495
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
then this user would talk to doctor

496
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
doctor would give them an

497
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,880
access code and with this access code

498
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
what the user does is to upload

499
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
the keys that they produced to a server

500
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,560
the rest of the users periodically

501
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
download all of the keys from the

502
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,639
servers from all of the positive users

503
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,480
and then they compare them with the

504
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
lists of scene numbers

505
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
and then with the numbers that they have

506
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,560
seen

507
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
they make a calculation with this

508
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,920
bluetooth um

509
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,079
with this bluetooth power that they have

510
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
and if with this calculation it is

511
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,639
deemed that they have been

512
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
close enough to other people so the

513
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
power is very high

514
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
for because that indicate that this is

515
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,759
more than 50 minutes

516
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
then they would receive a notification

517
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
that would tell

518
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
the user to take action what action

519
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
depends very much

520
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
on the country and how they have um

521
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,119
they have decided in the case of

522
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,199
switzerland it encourages the user to

523
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,160
self-isolate

524
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,039
and to call an info line for more um

525
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,880
instructions

526
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
so this system ensures that the only

527
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,160
information that ever leaves the phone

528
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,959
are just

529
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
these keys these temporary exposure keys

530
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,679
that are broadcasted

531
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,319
and only during the contagious period no

532
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,799
other information is needed

533
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
these keys depend on the phone they are

534
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
created randomly by the phone said they

535
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
are not associated to an identity

536
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
they are rotated on a predefined

537
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
schedule so they don't depend on

538
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
where the user is not with whom the user

539
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,000
is

540
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
and has no information about others is

541
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
only the information that they have

542
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,320
created

543
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
and this is how we ensure that in the

544
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
server or outside of the phone

545
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
there is no information available for

546
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
abuse limiting the purpose of this

547
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,480
system

548
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
that is essentially only useful to

549
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
actually trigger these notifications

550
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,799
even only if you have been close to

551
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,480
another user

552
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,520
and another thing that was very

553
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
important again because we were going to

554
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
ask millions of people to put

555
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
the system in the pockets was that the

556
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
system would disappear

557
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,880
when needed and of course we don't trust

558
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
that uh if the system is kind of uh and

559
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,480
useful many gov

560
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,080
maybe governments don't want to remove

561
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,919
it or they want to use it for something

562
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,480
else

563
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
but the way the system is designed the

564
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
system just sunsets by design

565
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,240
the moment the users do not participate

566
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
it is up to users to upload

567
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
keys to the server if users stop doing

568
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,960
this if users uninstall the app

569
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
then there is no more information

570
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
flowing around and the information that

571
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,960
was

572
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,280
stored in this server is actually

573
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
useless

574
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,679
because it you cannot use it for

575
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
anything else other than

576
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
if you had seen one of the beacons in

577
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
the past

578
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,760
um and for the rest of the talk i want

579
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,559
to focus

580
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,240
on the left part right we have been

581
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
talking a lot a lot a lot

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,160
about the right about the right side and

583
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,960
all of these

584
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
bluetooth and how it happens but there's

585
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
a lot to talk about about this left side

586
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
because here is where we see how this

587
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,080
apps right it's not about the protocol

588
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
the protocol is this very small part of

589
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,720
the system

590
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
that is integrated in in a mobile

591
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
operating system

592
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,240
that then is used by an app that then

593
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,559
has to be integrated in a health system

594
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,120
and has to abide to laws and to

595
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,000
epidemiological

596
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,640
reasons and how all of these interplays

597
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
with each other has a lot to do with

598
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
security and privacy

599
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
so the first thing is that we need an

600
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
authorization mechanism

601
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
that is because we have the requirement

602
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
that um only true positives can upload

603
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
that is to avoid that we have this kind

604
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
of fake alarms that would make the

605
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,360
system useless

606
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,679
so we need some kind of authentication

607
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
and authorization mechanism

608
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,559
and of course we want that this

609
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,000
mechanism does not

610
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
uh complicate the privacy properties of

611
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
the of the system

612
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
and we also want them to be hard to

613
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
delegate so that

614
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,559
if i receive one of these codes i cannot

615
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
give it to someone else and then they

616
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
can upload maybe numbers

617
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,559
and keys that are not actually positive

618
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,360
and they can launch

619
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
false alarms we didn't want anything and

620
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,200
when we thought about this the first

621
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
time on the theory

622
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
we just say well we know how to do this

623
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,159
like this cryptography to do this called

624
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,600
commitments we can just

625
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,159
ensure that the authorization code

626
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
contains the commitment to

627
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
the keys that they have to upload in

628
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,440
such a way

629
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,559
that i'm sure that if

630
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
code is given to carmilla only the phone

631
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
of carmella can actually upload

632
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
only the keys for kermit and that would

633
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,919
be great

634
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,000
other than that when we got to practice

635
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,120
and in reality

636
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
it turns out that most of the health

637
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,520
systems in the world are not digitalized

638
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,039
it is not easy to find a way of actually

639
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,960
creating these commitments

640
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
and we ended up not only in switzerland

641
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,039
but mostly everywhere

642
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,080
having very simple activation codes like

643
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,120
12 digits nothing complicated that

644
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,640
they're sent to the user

645
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
via phone or bs mail mail or

646
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,720
call them maybe via sms if you're super

647
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
advanced

648
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
and different countries have different

649
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,520
level of automatization of how this is

650
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,679
sent some of them require the

651
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
involvement of the doctor some of them

652
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
they send them automatically

653
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,200
and as far as i know all the belgium

654
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
went with

655
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
some very light version of commitments

656
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,679
um

657
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,840
i'm sure bart is around and can explain

658
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,679
more about how the system works

659
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,159
and still it is not really as far as i'm

660
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,039
concerned

661
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,799
having the full commitment to the keys

662
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
that you're gonna upload which also

663
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
comes from the fact that we have only

664
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,120
one particular

665
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
api right the one that google and apple

666
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
gives us and we don't have access to all

667
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,799
of the information that maybe we would

668
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,280
need

669
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
to do this in a privacy preserving way

670
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,960
without bothering the user

671
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
so okay now we have all of these and if

672
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
you think from a private engineering

673
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,080
perspective like are we done

674
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
like the system that i have described

675
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
kind of does all of the things that we

676
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,400
like

677
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
right simply with information but

678
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
if we go back to the description that i

679
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
gave it turns out

680
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
that the only moment when you upload

681
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
is when the user is copied positive so

682
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,760
if we

683
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
do take the system as is it means that

684
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
network traffic may actually reveal one

685
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
of the most sensitive information we

686
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,559
have in the system which is health

687
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
who is coveted positive and who is not

688
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
and of course in theory we have solved

689
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,000
this perfectly right we had this in the

690
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,960
white paper

691
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
in the line i mean i think there are a

692
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
couple more lines but we just said here

693
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,480
this can be mitigated using dummy

694
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
uploads right we have plenty

695
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
of research about this i have made half

696
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
of my career based on doing anonymous

697
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
communications and dummy traffic

698
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
we have this nailed and we have it

699
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
nailed except that in reality most of

700
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,000
the things that we write on paper this

701
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
cannot really be made um

702
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,159
so first of all in the papers we always

703
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,880
assume that the you know traffic is

704
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
poissonian traffic is binomial we just

705
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
have an assumption

706
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
with this in reality we have no idea how

707
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,760
traffic looks like

708
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
we have no idea with this user's

709
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,880
behavior let alone

710
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
uses behavior in pandemic times with a

711
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
new app that has never existed before

712
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,919
and then also we have a lot of

713
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
constraints that are associated to the

714
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:20,960
platform

715
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,320
and to the fact that we're deploying

716
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,640
this in real life so normally with dummy

717
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,520
traffic we just

718
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
kind of make this little very nice graph

719
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
and we just say depending on how much

720
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,840
time

721
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
traffic uh how much protection you have

722
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
but here we actually had to

723
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,799
reduce the bandwidth the bandwidth is

724
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,760
consumed

725
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,159
for real we cannot make users consume a

726
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,360
lot of bandwidth

727
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
with these applications because they are

728
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
gonna then uninstall

729
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
and say i don't want something that

730
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
actually kills my data plan

731
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
and we also need to take care about

732
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,760
service capacity servers are powerful

733
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,240
right they are they are clouds but still

734
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
you cannot hit them you cannot have

735
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,120
eight million swiss

736
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
hitting this server every minute right

737
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,120
we needed to have something that was

738
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,159
kind of smaller

739
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
and you also have to take into account

740
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
that all of these connections

741
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,640
actually also drain the battery of the

742
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
phone

743
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
and let's go back if we have users with

744
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
their phone battery drained

745
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,240
users are gonna say uninstall i don't

746
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,480
want this crap on my phone

747
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,679
we also had the case that um we could

748
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
not have anonymity we cannot rely on

749
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,279
infrastructure that is actually

750
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
not very good and we we cannot have

751
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,760
delays in the sense that it's very

752
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,679
important that information gets there

753
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,880
as soon as possible that's the

754
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,760
epidemiological reason so we had to go

755
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,840
for a very much weaker notion possible

756
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,960
deniability

757
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
we got everything to have constant time

758
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
and size and

759
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
the solution is an exponential i have

760
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
the link at the bottom of my slides if

761
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
you want to really know more about the

762
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,720
integrity details but also it turns out

763
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,799
that in practice it's not only about

764
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,640
just uploading more things because there

765
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
is authentication if we remember

766
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
so that means that because we have these

767
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
very silly

768
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
activation codes actually the system in

769
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
switzerland works that

770
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
you get an activation code from the

771
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,320
doctor but then you exchange that by a

772
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,960
token

773
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,880
that is actually what allows you to

774
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
upload information to the server

775
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
so that means that the dummies also must

776
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
realize this authentication step

777
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,799
that means that all the servers that we

778
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,400
build in the system have to take into

779
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
account that they're going to be dummies

780
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
and ensure equal timing and volume for

781
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
all of the operations so that means that

782
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,640
our little dummy traffic now ripples

783
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
to a lot more of the system than what we

784
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,559
thought

785
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,440
and in practice again this is not a

786
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
silly

787
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,600
kind of drawing of a phone it's a real

788
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
phone and the real phone has the google

789
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,640
and apple api

790
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
and google and apple had not thought

791
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,559
about this kind of data

792
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,200
and um for the early versions they had a

793
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
security mechanism

794
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
that meant that you could only reveal a

795
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,960
key after it expires

796
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,559
to be fair this is not needed for

797
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,080
security there was a uh

798
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
an implementation decision that they

799
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,120
made because they didn't think about

800
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
anything else around in the system like

801
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,520
authorization or this kind of

802
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,960
network protection uh so that meant that

803
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400
we needed to make a decision

804
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
which is what we do now with this extra

805
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
key that we cannot upload

806
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,799
and we cannot delay all the keys because

807
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,320
we're saying we need a timely

808
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
notification we cannot have people

809
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
waiting for one more day

810
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
running around maybe in so how we solve

811
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,520
this is

812
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,720
uh with a very dirty hack uh after the

813
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,360
token

814
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,679
is sent you receive a second token that

815
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,640
will allow you to

816
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
upload an extra key the next day but now

817
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,080
also means that dummy traffic

818
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,960
have to mimic the second upload and

819
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,080
surprise surprise

820
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
oh this fancy thing doesn't want you to

821
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,440
see the full sentence

822
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,080
the phone does not always wake up so all

823
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,640
of this thing the more complicated it is

824
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
and the more action the phone has to do

825
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
in a dummy situation

826
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
the more times the dummy traffic is

827
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,000
going to fail because the phone may not

828
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
wake up it may not get cpu in the

829
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,720
background

830
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
and there is nothing we can do because

831
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
that's how the operative system work

832
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,039
and because of that we had to make other

833
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,480
modifications that

834
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
i don't have the time to talk about

835
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,600
um one more minute one or two

836
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
okay yep i'm getting to the end so

837
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
we have um uh now that

838
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,559
all of this was done great we have dummy

839
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,480
but it doesn't sound that the servers do

840
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,159
not exist in the vacuum right

841
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
they don't exist like in my slide they

842
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
actually live in a cloud like this this

843
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,760
is more or less the map into the cloud

844
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,919
and this yellow part here is actually

845
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,279
the cloud infrastructure

846
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,360
that is off the shelf cloud managing

847
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
tools like the load balancer a firewall

848
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
that locked information that we did not

849
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
think it would be locked in any way

850
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,320
so that means that we when we designed

851
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
our system that the red on the back and

852
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
the the red and the black back ends

853
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,559
we need to design careful login to avoid

854
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
that you can do forensics to

855
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
actually go back and undo all of them

856
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
for me all of this dummy traffic kind of

857
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,039
protection and it means that we have to

858
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,320
do a lot of

859
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
work to ensure that uh any information

860
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,720
that is collected for a statistic for

861
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,399
the usage of the application

862
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,559
does not reveal any other information

863
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
about the dummy traffic

864
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
and i cannot tell you how many times we

865
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
had to redesign this login

866
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,520
because we discovered that there was

867
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
something hidden in the cloud that was

868
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,279
actually getting more information than

869
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,320
what we thought

870
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
because in off-the-shelf tools you

871
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,039
cannot avoid the things a lot

872
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,240
um by now this system has been deployed

873
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,200
uh all around the world as part of gaian

874
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,000
the

875
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,679
green places are the places that

876
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,000
actually use our code base and have many

877
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,279
of these other protections like the

878
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,120
dummy traffic and so forth

879
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,919
and these are some stats um of the usage

880
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,200
here in switzerland

881
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,559
where we can see that um there's another

882
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,320
percent of the population using it

883
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
and using a field experiment in turk

884
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,320
with surveys of

885
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,120
people that were coveted positive we

886
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,919
found out

887
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,039
that the app when it actually works

888
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,000
meaning when

889
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
people actually get codes it does

890
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,559
produce a number of quarantines and it

891
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,760
does actually help

892
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
break an infection change and in

893
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,799
particularly

894
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,880
it helps a lot with the speed people

895
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,559
that get notified with the app

896
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,760
get on average notified one day before

897
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,919
people that get notified via a manual

898
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,720
the key lessons for me is well first one

899
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,080
is the data is not a must

900
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
we can't produce data less applications

901
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,520
that are as

902
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
useful as those that uh collect

903
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,520
everything

904
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
privacy engineering goes well beyond

905
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
crypto the crypto part

906
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,360
preferred was the easy one the heart was

907
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
to build the full system and to ensure

908
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
that we could

909
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
lift the privacy properties that we had

910
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
on the protocol

911
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
when we connected this protocol to a

912
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:50,880
phone

913
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,080
and a whole set of servers and privacy

914
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,840
engineering in another world with

915
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,799
platforms

916
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
with the constraints and requirements

917
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
change all the time is exhausting the

918
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
amount of times we had to redesign

919
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,159
our whole system to make sure that we

920
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,240
would never be lying to the users

921
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,279
is amazing and the final is that

922
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,520
good social technical integration it's

923
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,279
not only about the technical part it's

924
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,360
also about how this gets integrated with

925
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,080
doctors

926
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
with users is the key to success and it

927
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
is extremely

928
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,840
hard in fact that's one of the reasons

929
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
why these applications don't have more

930
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,240
success

931
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,320
is because doctors cannot give codes

932
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,559
because users cannot insert the codes

933
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
and this is why when we deploy something

934
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
at the speed that we'll be deploying

935
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,480
in a kind of an experimental setting

936
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
this purpose limitation and the boost

937
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
prevention

938
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
is a must because otherwise you're just

939
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,559
going to deploy something

940
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,279
that may not work but may introduce more

941
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,200
problems than what it solved

942
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,799
and with this i'm happy to take

943
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
questions thank you

944
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
all right thank you commenter thank you

945
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
for the lovely talk

946
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,520
um right uh we do have a fair number of

947
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360
questions they're piling up in zulu i

948
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,480
will ask one or two

949
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
and then i will suggest that maybe you

950
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,080
go and um address them and zood up

951
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,039
yourself

952
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,760
so the first question from martin was

953
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,440
can you say a few words about working

954
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
with so many people across so many

955
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,919
fields of expertise what are the success

956
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,320
factors

957
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,679
what i have to say is that people in

958
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,799
this team were

959
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,840
lovely people um and this was

960
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
made even harder by the fact that we had

961
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,880
to work over

962
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
zoom right to be fair we did all of

963
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,960
these without

964
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,039
ever meeting in person and there are

965
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,960
many people in this team that have never

966
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,600
met each other in real life how the

967
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
intestinal

968
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
work works so well is because i think we

969
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
had a lot of very open-minded people

970
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,240
that were willing to listen to the other

971
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,559
side and to learn about what the other

972
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,200
side

973
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
had to say and we were thinking about

974
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,360
negotiating but i think the most

975
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,399
important

976
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,519
of all is that we had one common goal

977
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,640
which was to help with the pandemic

978
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
and when you have one common goal so

979
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,000
much easier to

980
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,840
get to agreement great thank you

981
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
so one more last um quick question and

982
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,440
let's maybe try and keep the answer

983
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,039
brief so we can move on to the next talk

984
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,799
but from ari

985
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,720
were you aware of the other similar

986
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
approaches at bu

987
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
or mit when you started this work in

988
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,679
march

989
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,080
uh was there an initial collaboration on

990
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
the protocol

991
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,320
no no we when we started we were not we

992
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,880
became

993
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,679
like uh attend uh aware a little bit

994
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,399
later

995
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,600
there was a lot i think of

996
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,279
collaborations and conversation which

997
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
had also been very important

998
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,080
but what my learning was about that is

999
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,159
that yet we didn't have peer review but

1000
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:42,960
the fact that

1001
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,360
so many groups from very good

1002
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
institutions with a lot of people behind

1003
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,559
came up with the same protocol at the

1004
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,000
same time must mean something

1005
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,519
okay thank you carmela again and you

1006
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,279
know i'm sure everybody is

1007
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,640
giving you a round of applause it was a

1008
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
great talk please
