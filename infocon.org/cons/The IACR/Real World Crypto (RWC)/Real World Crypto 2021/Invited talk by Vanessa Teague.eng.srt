1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,800
okay you may begin enjoy your session

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,920
okay now yes hello everybody

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
hi um are you happy with the screen

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
sharing as it is

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
am i sharing my whole slides properly or

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,880
just

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,920
my pdf viewer of my slides i can see the

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,240
pdf view of your slides

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,839
okay let's try that again slideshow

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
all right i'm going to share my zoom

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,079
screen for a second and then we're going

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,719
to switch

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
to this how's that

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
yes there we go do you want to just

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,280
advancing the slide

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
quickly just want to test in advance

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,760
all right all right so

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
hello everyone i'm kenny um

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,280
so sorry so so next up we have vanessa

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
vanessa teague uh

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
vanessa is the ceo of thinking cyber

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
security and is part of the computer

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
science research group at the australian

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,840
national university

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
and vanessa has been engaged in security

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
and privacy research regarding

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
data and e-voting and medical data and

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
she's a contributor to the mit laid

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,040
project

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
pac which is private automated contact

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,560
tracing so

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
vanessa today you're going to talk to us

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,240
about how some contract tracing apps

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
aren't as private as we thought

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
over to you thank you

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
okay first of all this is not about pact

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
this is primarily

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,320
about social graph edge inference

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
in both australia australia's

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,680
curvaturing app

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
and in gaapel systems

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
and really this is two different

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
10-minute talks the first one

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
has not very much to do with crypto but

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
quite a lot to do with the real world

46
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,759
and the second has a little bit more

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,640
crypto and a

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
more tenuous uh connection with the real

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,560
world

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
but here we are real world crypto i'm

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
going to start talking about

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,679
centralized vessels decentralized

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
contact tracing this is a paragraph

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
from the open letter which many of us

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
signed

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
what seems like a very long time ago but

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,120
was actually less than a year ago

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
we said that we were extremely keen

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
government should be extremely keen to

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,599
avoid

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,080
solutions that are now reconstructing

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
invasive information about individuals

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
and specifically

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
the social graph in other words who has

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,480
been

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
nearby most countries including

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
switzerland

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
uh heeded this advice whether they

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
wanted to or not realizing

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
the practical superiority of game

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
systems australia did not australia like

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
france

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,599
singapore and a couple of other

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,519
countries insisted on using

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
a centralized app which explicitly

76
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,280
uploads to a government server the

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
social graph

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
of a person who has tested positive for

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
covert

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
so it uses bluetooth low energy beacons

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
just like gain systems but

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,159
it um the what the what's contained

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,720
in that beacon is an encryption of your

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,280
id

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
and when you test positive you upload

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,480
the list

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
of all of the people you've been near

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
over the last two weeks

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,519
so part of the point of this talk is to

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,680
say that the implications of this

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,879
are not quite what we imagined first of

92
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,200
all

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
we were mostly right but we were also

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
partly wrong

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
here are some

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,200
insights from what really happened when

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
this app hit the road first of all

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
it's really important to remember that

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,040
not running something

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
constitutes a spectacular privacy

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
advantage

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
and most of the people who

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
wrote a comment on the app store wrote

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,439
comments

105
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,760
like this this is sorry this is not the

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
app store this is google's play store

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,920
but the apple app store is pretty

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
similar

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
and the theme here which very much

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
reflects the other side of the coin that

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
carmilla was talking about

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,960
is people are so upset with the battery

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
usage

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
that they uninstall the app so the word

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
uninstall appears in a very large

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
fraction

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
of uh comments

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
about this app if you're not running the

119
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,560
app

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
you're not exposing any information to

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,840
the government about the edges in your

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,740
social graph

123
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,520
[Music]

124
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
but it didn't stop there the australian

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
app had a bunch of other

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,680
unexpected privacy features at one point

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
the implementation

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
of encryption specifically between

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
the two versions of the iphone version

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,039
of the app

131
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,720
was devised in such a way that it

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
transferred payloads that were

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,160
sufficiently garbled that they couldn't

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,919
be decrypted at the other end so even if

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,160
you did test positive and you did upload

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
the list of uh people that you'd been

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
near to the government server

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
the ciphertext was unreadable so again

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,240
this is a

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,280
fabulous privacy feature

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
that wasn't really intended in the basis

142
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
of this design

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,360
another privacy feature was that again

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
the iphone version

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840
maxed out the

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,759
bluetooth connections of the phone which

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
is a thing i didn't even know it was

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
possible to do but apparently

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
an iphone is really only able to make a

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
hundred odd

151
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,639
uh bluetooth low energy connections with

152
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,320
the expectation that you know there's

153
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
one for your speakers and maybe one for

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,880
your

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
diabetes monitor and one one each

156
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
for a series of other specific devices

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
or connections that you want to make

158
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,759
it was never designed to do this kind of

159
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
massive complicated thing where you make

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
new uh connections with dozens and

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
dozens of other phones all the time

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
and the app wasn't properly designed to

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
close them off

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
so after you'd met a hundred people it

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
just in one version of the app

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
just kind of stopped making new

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
connections and recording new edges of

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
the social graph

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
uh it also stopped talking to people's

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
diabetes monitors and

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,520
apple watches and so forth so again

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
enough this motivated another whole

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
group of people to uninstall it

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,280
and even if you hadn't uninstalled it

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,840
then

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,720
in many cases it wasn't making new uh

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
recordings of new social edges that you

178
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,750
made

179
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,680
[Music]

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
so one of the things that i think is

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
quite interesting about this is we're

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,919
very accustomed to

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,840
security and privacy failures being

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,479
invisible

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
and we know that an app can seem to be

186
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,319
working perfectly well

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
but actually have serious security or

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,440
privacy problems that are not evident to

189
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,400
users

190
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
in the case of this bluetooth based

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,479
contact tracing app

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,720
it's quite an unusual example in which

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
actually just a basic functionality

194
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,919
failure

195
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
is for all practical purposes

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
undetectable by ordinary users

197
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,400
you can kind of tell if you really set

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,960
up your

199
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,319
your system carefully to read bluetooth

200
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
messages but if you're just kind of

201
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,720
using the app

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
you do not have any way of noticing

203
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,199
that it isn't working and

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
in australia we really just don't know

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,080
how many people are still actively

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,599
running it the government very proudly

207
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,240
touts

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
the download rate which is quite high

209
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
but you saw from the comments that

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,280
there's a good amount

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,080
of anecdotal evidence that a large

212
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
fraction of those people who downloaded

213
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
it are not running it anymore

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
they have up-to-date information about

215
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
who's running it just because of the way

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
the protocol is designed it effectively

217
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
pings a an amazon server regularly they

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,879
could count that

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,479
uh if they are counting it they're not

220
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,199
saying we suspect the actual number of

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
people still running is very low

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
and we also don't know what fraction of

223
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
proximity events it detects those

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
specific bugs that i mentioned

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
earlier in the talk have mostly been

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,199
fixed

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
but we don't have any kind of reliable

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
data

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
about the overall working of the system

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
we don't know whether

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,440
the fact that we've spotted a certain

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
number of different bugs and mostly got

233
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
them fixed means that there

234
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
aren't very many functionality bugs left

235
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
or whether that was just the tip of the

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,440
iceberg and there are all kinds of

237
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,599
situations in which it still doesn't

238
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
we definitely know that there are some

239
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
situations in which it simply does not

240
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
work the for example the

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
situation in which two locked iphones

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,519
come into proximity with each other and

243
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
not with any other phones

244
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
but we don't have overall data about its

245
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,279
overall

246
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
rate of success

247
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,399
but we do know that it's been basically

248
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,279
useless in uh addressing that

249
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
pandemic this little quote is from a

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
report by the parliament by

251
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
parliamentary committee of my state

252
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
parliament in victoria remembering that

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
the app is a federal government

254
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
initiative

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
and it says the effectiveness of the

256
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
covert safe app for victoria's contact

257
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,839
racing efforts

258
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
was insignificant the app has helped

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,959
find an additional

260
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,440
17 contacts not found through manual

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
contact tracing so this is a donation of

262
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
25 million people admittedly we haven't

263
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
had very many cases

264
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
and admittedly this 17 number is a

265
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,839
little bit out of date i think it's up

266
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,760
to 20 or something now but to find

267
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
only 20 contacts in a population of 25

268
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
million people

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
is really much much

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,839
less effective than anybody was hoping

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
so just in case anybody takes my

272
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,360
previous remarks about

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,959
non-functionality being a privacy

274
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,480
feature too seriously

275
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
there's a very very long list of issues

276
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,519
that have

277
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
imposed a serious uh not only for

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
serious functionality problems and

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
usability problems but also

280
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
very serious privacy and security issues

281
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
i i didn't discover most of these uh

282
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,279
most of them were discovered by the

283
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
the long long list of names that you see

284
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,399
below

285
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,600
but i've been keeping a little summary

286
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
on github which you can go and look at

287
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
if you like

288
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
just in case my remarks about privacy

289
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,200
were too strongly worded i've chosen a

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,600
couple

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
of random examples of other privacy

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
issues that this app had which had

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
nothing whatsoever to do

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
with inferring social graph edges

295
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
there was an issue discovered by jim

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
masarad and elon tu

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
which was a silent pairing issue in

298
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
other words when you're running the app

299
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
an attacker could kind of silently pair

300
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,160
with your phone

301
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
and bond with your phone in a way that

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
allowed it

303
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,560
not only to track your phone while you

304
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
were using the app

305
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,839
but actually to extract the

306
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
long-term uh identity of the phone and

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,720
in particular a key called the identity

308
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
resolving key which i think is

309
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
essentially used as a

310
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
uh seed for generating the

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,519
bluetooth mac address so once you've

312
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,720
extracted this

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
secret from the phone you could track

314
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,079
the phone forever

315
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,600
even after the person uninstalled the

316
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,760
app

317
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,360
here's another example which does for

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
the first time have a little bit to do

319
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,079
with cryptography is that

320
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,519
they they devised their own

321
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
payload encryption algorithm which had

322
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,079
the interesting property that

323
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
it had a plaintext counter as part of

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,920
the cipher text

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
which isn't inherently a disaster until

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,279
you realize that

327
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
the plaintext counter was a thing that

328
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
got incremented

329
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
every time you exchanged

330
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,519
payloads with another person and uh so

331
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,639
this would kind of increment an

332
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
increment and increment until a key

333
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
refresh which happened about every

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
uh five minutes or so

335
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
and so you were effectively walking

336
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,639
around kind of broadcasting a little

337
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,360
count

338
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,920
of how many other people you'd exchanged

339
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
messages with in the last five minutes

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
which doesn't sound like a disaster but

341
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
it would certainly

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
refute a claim that you had been alone

343
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
in some circumstances

344
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,720
for example this has now

345
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
i was going to say fixed but i think

346
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,959
it's more accurate to say this has been

347
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
changed and you can look at the list of

348
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,800
issues to see

349
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
in what way so the first part of my

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
conclusion or other the conclusion for

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
the first part of my talk

352
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,839
is for centralized apps like

353
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
covered safe inferring social graph

354
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
edges is the least of our worries

355
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
there are all kinds of other privacy and

356
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
security issues like

357
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
allowing for long-term tracking by third

358
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
parties

359
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
and uh exposing information about who

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
you are and who you've communicated with

361
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,959
again to third parties who are in your

362
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,040
vicinity never mind about whether you

363
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
trust the government with

364
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
sensitive information or not

365
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,800
and in fact by far the greatest

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
disappointment and concern about this

367
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
app is simply that it doesn't seem to

368
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,600
work

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
we're not sure how much it isn't working

370
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
but it definitely

371
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
doesn't seem to be working well

372
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
okay so now i'm going to move on to the

373
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
second part of my talk which is that

374
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,480
actually

375
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
gain systems didn't at least in their

376
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
early versions

377
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
protect the privacy of the social graph

378
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
as much as you would hope

379
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
and in particular there's a scenario in

380
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,680
which

381
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
a malicious

382
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,880
central government server can

383
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
if humans if users opt to upload some

384
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,519
extra information

385
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
can infer some social edges

386
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,440
so the background to this is that one of

387
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
the things that happened almost

388
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
immediately when game systems started to

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,839
be rolled out

390
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
was that even though the system as i

391
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,279
understand it was more or less designed

392
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,760
to be used in the way that the swiss

393
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,639
used it with all of the computation done

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
on the user's phone and all of the

395
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
inferences about whether or not the

396
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
person had been exposed

397
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,199
and the risk computations and so forth

398
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,479
being done on the phone

399
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,959
many governments immediately tried to

400
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,920
get users to opt-in to uploading more

401
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,600
information

402
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,880
and although this wasn't really

403
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,639
encouraged it also wasn't

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
explicitly prohibited anywhere that i

405
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
found

406
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
i know for example that the irish app

407
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,199
allows people to

408
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
opt in to a notification to the

409
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,079
government

410
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,279
that they have been exposed that their

411
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,120
app has told them they've been exposed

412
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
it doesn't

413
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
convey the detailed information needed

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
for this attack but it conveys

415
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
effectively one bit of information

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
so the setting in which this attack

417
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,399
works is a hypothetical setting

418
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,639
in which the user

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
opts in to uploading the detailed

420
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
exposure information data which is

421
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
not just the fact that they've been

422
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,199
exposed but the list

423
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,480
that is that the api outputs to the app

424
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
of what the exposures were

425
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
how approximately how long they were

426
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,720
what

427
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,079
the uh what the day of exposure was

428
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
and what uh approximately what durations

429
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,199
the exposures were

430
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,959
so this is a little uh a little record

431
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,079
of some de-identified information about

432
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,480
the

433
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
exposures that led to the conclusion

434
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
that the person had

435
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
potentially been exposed to covert now i

436
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,560
don't know for sure that any apps

437
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,440
actually did this

438
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
but i looked through both google and

439
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,720
apple's documentation i couldn't find

440
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,759
any prohibition

441
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
against doing this i should also say

442
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,880
that this issue was

443
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,079
fixed in june before i notified

444
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,680
uh before before i knew about it and

445
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,800
before i notified either of the

446
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
manufacturers so i i didn't

447
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,680
discover this uh for the first time it

448
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
seems to have been fixed before i

449
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,639
noticed it but i think it's interesting

450
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,600
and worth worth explaining because i

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,880
haven't seen it written up elsewhere

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
both manufacturers have now fixed it by

453
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
shuffling the exposure information

454
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
before it is it says uploaded on my

455
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
slide but i mean um

456
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,199
exported from the api to the app so as

457
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:41,680
long as

458
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
the order of those exposure records is

459
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,839
shuffled

460
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
uh the problem seems to go away

461
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
okay so here's the setting in which

462
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
we're working

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,639
suppose annika tests

464
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,680
positive for code and she has

465
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
an interview with some human contact

466
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,160
traces in which she tells the human

467
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,359
contact officers

468
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,559
that she had uh specific contacts with

469
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,599
bob charlie and dan and she tells the

470
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
contact tracers in some detail about

471
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
uh you know maybe she was talking to bob

472
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,359
for 20 minutes and she had her phone in

473
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,079
her handbag

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
and then she passed charlie for five

475
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,599
minutes and she pulled her phone out and

476
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,000
looked something up and she interacted

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,280
with dan in some other way that she

478
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,799
describes in a reasonable amount of

479
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,839
detail

480
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
this kind of detail does get conveyed in

481
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
context racer

482
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
interviews light

483
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,559
up but crucially

484
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,559
annika doesn't want to admit to the

485
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,679
authorities that

486
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,880
she met with wit and she

487
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
doesn't tell the human uh contact

488
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,240
tracers

489
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
about a meeting with wit that she had on

490
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,440
the same day

491
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,559
so and nevertheless the authorities are

492
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,840
very interested in the possible

493
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
existence of this connection and that's

494
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
what they want to find out

495
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,880
so we have to assume that later in the

496
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
day

497
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,799
whit and at least some of anika's

498
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,679
friends

499
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,559
also test positive and upload their

500
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,360
diagnosis keys to

501
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,320
their gain system now this may seem like

502
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
a lot of coincidences

503
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
it's actually not a crazy set of

504
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
coincidences if we assume that anika was

505
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
the source of the infection and annika

506
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,400
infected

507
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,840
many of her friends and then her friends

508
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
tested positive it doesn't have to be

509
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,440
all of her friends it just has to be

510
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,799
some fraction of them

511
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
of those blue lines that she describes

512
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
to the human contact houses

513
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
so here's how

514
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,320
the authorities can

515
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
infer the existence of that social edge

516
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
between

517
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,360
annika and whit i'm going to start from

518
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,719
the start of my fancy video again

519
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
in the beginning

520
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
the public exposure key list that comes

521
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
from the government server

522
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
is supposed to be randomly shuffled but

523
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
let's suppose that the malicious

524
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
authority doesn't shuffle it randomly

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,160
but instead very deliberately organizes

526
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,960
the published exposure keys in such a

527
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,520
way

528
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
that wit is at the very end and

529
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,520
the contacts that annika admitted to are

530
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
arranged in a very specific order just

531
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
beforehand

532
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
like this so that exposure

533
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
key set gets conveyed

534
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
to annika's phone

535
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,600
annika's phone at least in the old

536
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,240
versions

537
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,600
of the game api

538
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
would filter this list deterministically

539
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
and not shuffle

540
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
and

541
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
if annika agreed to upload

542
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
the result of all that exposure

543
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
information back to the government

544
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,919
server

545
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
the government server would get in order

546
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
the de-identified records of each of

547
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
those interactions now

548
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
it wouldn't say who was who

549
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,159
and actually annika doesn't even know

550
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,080
which filtered record corresponds to

551
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
which of her interactions

552
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
but there's enough metadata in each of

553
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
those records or there could be enough

554
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
metadata in each of those records such

555
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
as the duration and intensity

556
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,240
of the interaction to allow the

557
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,799
authorities to re-identify the records

558
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,200
of bob

559
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
charlie and dan and if that's the case

560
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
and the authorities are able to see very

561
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
clearly

562
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,919
that the um records

563
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
of the contacts that annika admitted to

564
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,760
appear in order in a way consistent with

565
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
the account that she gave to human

566
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
contact traces

567
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
then the crucial piece of information

568
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,960
that they can look for

569
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
very simply is whether there's another

570
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
record

571
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
after that list and if there is a record

572
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,679
that follows on

573
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,280
from the records they can identify for

574
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
bob charlie and dan

575
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
and if they've organized it carefully so

576
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
that whit is the

577
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,039
only possible person who could appear

578
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,840
after that

579
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
then they know for sure that there was

580
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
an edge in the social graph between

581
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,879
annika and witt

582
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
so this relies crucially on being able

583
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,760
to identify the records for the people

584
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,880
that annika

585
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
admits that she did have something to

586
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,679
that she did have some contact with

587
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,799
um it doesn't have to be all of them

588
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,960
but it has to be enough of them to be

589
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
able to align

590
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
that list of records with the

591
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,799
uh uploaded exposure information that

592
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,280
she

593
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,720
returns to the government server

594
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,320
okay so no

595
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600
okay so in conclusion

596
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
we were mostly right right about

597
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,039
centralized versus

598
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,440
decentralized contact tracing all other

599
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
things being equal

600
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
decentralized amps protect the privacy

601
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
of users and in particular the social

602
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,440
graph but also other things

603
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
better than centralized ones however the

604
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
all other things being equal thing is

605
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
actually an important case yet

606
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,919
and all of the people who in australia

607
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,720
did download the app did want to use it

608
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
possibly turned on their bluetooth

609
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
contrary to their habit uh and would

610
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,679
have been still walking around with

611
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
bluetooth turned on and the gain app

612
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
running if we'd had a gain app

613
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
have in fact uninstalled it possibly

614
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,039
turned their bluetooth off

615
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
and are now protecting their privacy

616
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,159
much better than they would be

617
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
if they've been using almost anything

618
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
else even including the extremely well

619
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,760
designed

620
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
swiss app

621
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,919
but centralized navs are used a lot less

622
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,360
because they eat through people's

623
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
batteries in a catastrophic way

624
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,320
and they have a whole host of other

625
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
problems

626
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,960
and then the second part of the talk is

627
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
to say although

628
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,320
the gain apps if they're

629
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,720
used in the way they were designed for

630
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
and probably

631
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
as they are in switzerland and many

632
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
other countries i don't i'm pretty sure

633
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,520
there isn't a way for the authorities to

634
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,320
infer

635
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,520
the edges of the social graph

636
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,280
if you insist on using it in a way it

637
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,799
wasn't intended to be

638
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
used in there was a way

639
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,200
to infer edges of the social graph uh it

640
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
has been fixed

641
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,200
now by uh shuffling on the client side

642
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,080
by both apple

643
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
and google before annika's list

644
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,640
of exposure information is returned to

645
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,279
the server

646
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,799
and obviously it's fixed by refusing to

647
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,400
convey that information back to the

648
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
authorities as well

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
so overall it's certainly clear that

650
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,279
gain apps are

651
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,039
much better than centralized apps

652
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,400
especially if you

653
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,919
care about function rather than just

654
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,360
caring about privacy

655
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
but i think it's important to realize

656
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,720
that there are unintended privacy

657
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,120
consequences

658
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,279
and there might be other privacy impacts

659
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,400
that we don't currently know about

660
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,240
so i'll leave it there and invite

661
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
questions

662
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
thank you so much vanessa um thank you

663
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,159
so much

664
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,559
into the australian now they are

665
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,360
so i'll start with one from arie are you

666
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,000
aware of any

667
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
attacks on the app in the wild and i

668
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,200
think this is the

669
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,919
australian app

670
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,840
but you're muted

671
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
sorry i don't know how i managed to mute

672
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
myself in the context of listening to

673
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
aries talk hi

674
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,919
um not as far as i'm aware and i think

675
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,520
part of the answer is

676
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,840
that probably its usage is very low i'm

677
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,159
not

678
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,480
certain uh but it's probably there's

679
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
probably not really anything

680
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,159
to um there's probably not enough users

681
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,000
to bother implementing much of an attack

682
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
on the other hand it's important to

683
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,919
realize that uh attacks particularly

684
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,679
privacy attacks would be invisible

685
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,440
right so if there are shopping centers

686
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
using it to track

687
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
uh customers or some other nasty

688
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
surreptitious thing we wouldn't know

689
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
right thank you um there's a

690
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
thanksgiving

691
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,840
second question i believe android is

692
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
located

693
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
location services collects and this is a

694
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,679
question from james

695
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
um so i actually missed the first part

696
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:58,880
of the question could you

697
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
you believe that android location

698
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
services i had to be turned on for the

699
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,679
app to run is that correct and is there

700
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,039
information about which

701
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,039
how much how much google can infer

702
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
that's the result yeah this is a really

703
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,480
good question

704
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,000
so uh

705
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,760
android as you probably know android

706
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,200
requires

707
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,520
the global location setting to be turned

708
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
on

709
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,640
if you are scanning for

710
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,080
bluetooth low energy and

711
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
the thinking is of course that if an

712
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,640
app is allowed to scan for bluetooth

713
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
low energy beacons then it can

714
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
effectively do its own location tracing

715
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,679
so the argument

716
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,960
is you know whether you agree with the

717
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,799
architecture not the argument is that

718
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,360
this is a nice way of conveying to users

719
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,080
the idea

720
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,000
that this app can has the potential to

721
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,040
track their location

722
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,149
[Music]

723
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,840
i don't know how much

724
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,320
information about people's proximity

725
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,919
can be conveyed to google

726
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
as a result of this the app did not

727
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,159
use location services

728
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,840
in other words it did not ping back to

729
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,880
google and ask

730
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
google where the user was at the time

731
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,799
so it had to have that capacity turned

732
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,600
on

733
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
but it didn't take advantage of anything

734
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,440
other than

735
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
the opportunity to scan

736
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
so i guess if you're not actually

737
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
querying google's location services at

738
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,320
the time

739
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,760
you are near somebody else then i assume

740
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,080
that

741
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,559
google doesn't have an immediate way of

742
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
inferring

743
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,559
that you are near another person but i

744
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,559
don't really know exactly how it works

745
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,200
and i'm not sure how frequently

746
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,399
an android phone would be querying

747
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,480
google's location services

748
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,919
as a general rule great

749
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,960
thank you thank you so much and thank

750
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
you again for the talk and thank you for

751
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,919
joining us

752
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,600
i know the timing is awkward for you um

753
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,919
thanks everybody there are some

754
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,240
questions still exuded for you so if you

755
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
have time

756
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
given that it's a strange hour for you

757
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,679
um you can continue the discussion

758
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,760
with um but thank you again vanessa

759
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,840
