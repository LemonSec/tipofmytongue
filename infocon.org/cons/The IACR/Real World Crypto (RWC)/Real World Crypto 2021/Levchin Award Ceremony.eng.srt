1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
okay should be good to go enjoy all

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,400
right fantastic thank you okay

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
um so we're off to a great start with

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,600
real world crypto

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
first session went uh really well

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
excellent uh set of talks

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,639
and with that actually i guess we'll

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,920
start kind of a fun part of the

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
conference which is

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
uh the awarding of the lovechin prize so

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
let me remind you we award the livecam

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,119
prize every year

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,600
and the levchin prize honors major

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,519
innovations in cryptography

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
that have actually had a significant

16
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,199
real world impact yeah and

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
we'll see the uh winners from the past

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
in just a second so you'll see

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920
the the type of uh results that actually

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
win this prize

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,520
um let me see i need to be okay so let's

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,719
see so the liftion prize

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
um was started in 2016

24
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
thanks to a generous donation from max

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,079
levchin max levchin as

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
as you may know is the founder of paypal

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
and a firm and

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
many other successful companies um so

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
let's see the prize actually is an award

30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,079
of

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,879
ten thousand dollars per prize and we

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
give out two awards every year so i'm

33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,680
really

34
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
happy to be able you know to be able to

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,199
um

36
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
to celebrate these results in real world

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
crypto and you know

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
i guess it's great for the community

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
that we can that we have actually

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
are able to give this prize and we have

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
results that uh

42
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
you know that we can award the prize to

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,680
okay so

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
uh that's the prize the prize itself as

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
we said is ten thousand dollars but it

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
also oh actually no before that

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
let me just remind you who actually uh

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
won the prize

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
up uh in the past so you can see i won't

50
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
read them all but you can see the list

51
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
of distinguished people

52
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,360
and teams and projects that won the

53
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,600
award in the past

54
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
i guess last year we had ralph merkel

55
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,600
for all of his work on

56
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
on hash functions and then wang and

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
stevens for their work on

58
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
on collisions and before that uh again

59
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
you can see we had a

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
a lot of people who did fantastic work

61
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
in the world area of world real world

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,520
crypto

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,439
okay the prize itself is actually well

64
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,640
like i said in addition to the ten

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
thousand dollar prize

66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
the prize also comes with a trophy and a

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
trophy is a cryptex

68
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,639
that uh actually opens up if you find

69
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
the correct

70
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
uh the correct password and usually we

71
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
would put the

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,040
check award prize in the in the cryptex

73
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
except uh this year we couldn't quite do

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,480
it because everything is done remotely

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
so i hope the award winners have figured

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
out how to open their their

77
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,640
trophy and they'll show you the trophy

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,200
as we

79
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,400
uh reveal unveil the awards okay so

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
let's get started for one moment sorry

81
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,440
it seems like your slides are not

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
advancing we're getting some messages in

83
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,440
the chat

84
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
saying that really i might spoil the

85
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
effect a little bit when you get to the

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,959
actual announcement

87
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
it does yeah that would not be bad that

88
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,160
would be bad

89
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,519
why is that so okay is uh are you guys

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
seeing the

91
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
yeah we're not seeing slide advancement

92
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
um

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
so let me why don't i

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
quit the uh let me just leave me to

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
restart it then

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
thanks for bearing with us everybody

97
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,159
yeah

98
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,720
interesting uh problems just a minute

99
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
um i think it's safe to say that dan is

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
not a newcomer to teaching online

101
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
no i'm surprised this app this actually

102
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
happened

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
but let me just a second we're having

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
i'm having some issues here we'll fix it

105
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
in just a second

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
okay so where did my zoom go

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
all right here we go um so what i'll do

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
is i will try to share powerpoint

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
directly

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
so i guess now you're seeing are you

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
seeing the slides now

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
uh we see you'll need to put it into

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
presentation mode we're seeing the uh

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,680
right now yes and then try to advance

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
i'll go back yes okay thank you

116
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
oh boy that's kind of unfortunate that

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
didn't work um

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
at any rate i'll let you let you look at

119
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
the previous prize winners from previous

120
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
years

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
i hope everybody's seeing that now um

122
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
okay and so let's with that this is the

123
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,160
the

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,358
lovechin trophy um this is cryptex

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,000
and with that let me introduce this

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,199
year's winners

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
so uh the two 21 left chin prize winners

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
for willowbrook crypto the first one

129
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,199
goes to

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
uh neil koblis and victor miller for the

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
invention of elliptic curve cryptography

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
so they actually the two of them came

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,160
up with this wonderful wonderful idea

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
together

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
i actually actually uh independently but

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
uh around around the same time and i

137
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
actually have copies of their papers

138
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,440
here

139
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,479
so you can see the abstracts from the

140
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,600
mid-1980s

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
for the invention of elliptic curve

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
crypto these two papers

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
it's really interesting if you look at

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
um at victor's abstract

145
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
it's actually quite present right where

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
it says with the current bounds

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
for infeasible attack it appears to be

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
20 percent faster

149
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
than dfe hellman over a finite field and

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
as computational power grows this

151
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
disparity should get

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
uh rapidly bigger yeah so in fact this

153
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,240
was

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
quite predictive of uh where things are

155
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
going to go and in fact today of course

156
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
elliptic curve cryptography is used

157
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
everywhere is in

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
a lot of standards and even as we saw in

159
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
the earlier session there's

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,400
actually good reasons to move to

161
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
elliptic curve crypto and not use

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,039
um finite fields so this has been a

163
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
super influential result

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
so we're obviously the whole community

165
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,479
is very grateful to victor miller and

166
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,919
neil koblitz and it's great to be able

167
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
to want to recognize this this this

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,639
results

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,199
um with this award and so with that i'm

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,000
going to invite

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
victor and neil to uh come up to the

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,520
stage

173
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,919
and uh yeah say a few words so uh victor

174
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
why don't you go first

175
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
hey ah man thanks thanks stan

176
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
um and and members of the prize

177
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
committee i'm really

178
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
honored to receive the levchin prize uh

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
and little did i imagine 35 years ago

180
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
that when i made a challenging proposal

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,919
of cryptographers

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
that it would have so much impact uh you

183
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,759
know the study of elliptic curves is

184
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
once a rather arcane sub area within the

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
study of diaphantine equations and up

186
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
until about 1980

187
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,199
there were probably no more than about

188
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,639
100 people in the world who knew

189
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,720
anything advanced about them

190
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
so i studied elliptic curves in graduate

191
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
school and did my thesis work about them

192
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
and in the early 80s i was exposed to

193
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,000
the diffie-hellman

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
problem from don coppersmith who was one

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,919
of my colleagues

196
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,600
uh was a technical sounding board for

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,919
his l of one third attack on the uh

198
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,000
on this on the uh diffie-hellman says

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,319
you know problem over gf2 to the end

200
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,759
and i thought that it was too bad that

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,440
such a nice idea suddenly became more

202
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,639
vulnerable

203
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,639
um and so many people realized that

204
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
diffie-hellman problem could be done

205
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
over any algebraic group

206
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,800
any group that had an efficient

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
multiplication algorithm and i knew that

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
so things called algebraic groups fill

209
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
the bill elliptic curves are the

210
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,080
simplest

211
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
form of an algebraic group that's

212
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
qualitatively very different than field

213
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,360
multiplication

214
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
or or matrix multiplication and i was

215
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
able to show

216
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
that the sort of attacks that were

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,919
successful against stiffy hellman

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,360
over the multiplicative group of a

219
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
finite field couldn't work

220
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
when applied to elliptic curves over a

221
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
finite field so and my analysis is

222
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,000
pretty much

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,479
held up to this day i'm also gratified

224
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
that my proposal opened up knowledge

225
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,599
about elliptic curves to a much wider

226
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,120
audience and employment for

227
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
well-deserving number theorists

228
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,400
and even if elliptic curve

229
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,080
diffie-hellman will fade away when

230
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
quantum computers are fully operational

231
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,639
their impact will remain for example

232
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
with isogeny-based pq crypto

233
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
um and dan you you asked me to say uh a

234
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
few remarks about areas i think that

235
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
real world crypto should concentrate in

236
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,199
so here are a few uh a few years ago i

237
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,639
think right at the beginning as you had

238
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
the leptin prizes won by the mitls team

239
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
for using program verification for

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
implementation of the whole tls protocol

241
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,120
well i've come to believe that

242
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
programming in a way that could be

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,080
verified will absolutely become

244
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
mandatory for cryptography

245
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,680
there are just too many holes that can

246
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
cause vulnerabilities otherwise

247
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
and i'm not sure that existing tools

248
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,599
like f-star even though it's really

249
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,319
great

250
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
are quite ready for prime time yet but

251
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,759
uh

252
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,520
everybody this should be on everybody's

253
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
radar they you really have to

254
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
do this i think and the second thing i'd

255
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
mention is how does security look like

256
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,240
to the end user

257
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
why are we still using passwords i'm

258
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
hardly the first person to say this but

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
so far no one has come up with a good

260
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,080
substitute

261
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,760
right now the password of all i use has

262
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
a few hundred different passwords this

263
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
is really crazy

264
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
and i'm really tired of answering

265
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
capture's queries about what pictures

266
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,080
contain traffic lights and crosswalks

267
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
um one of murphy's famous laws is the

268
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
reason it's so hard to make things

269
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,160
foolproof

270
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
is that fools are so creative

271
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
cryptography does not function in a

272
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,480
vacuum

273
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
if the user interface a web page is made

274
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
so difficult to navigate users will

275
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
either not use the web page

276
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
or find some way undoubtedly insecure to

277
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
go around security so even if you don't

278
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
work in user experience

279
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
you should closely collaborate with

280
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
people who do

281
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
in conclusion keep up the good work and

282
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
make cryptography usable in the real

283
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
world

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
awesome well said victor in fact a good

285
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
collection of questions there

286
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
yes and uh yeah and i also wanted to

287
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
invite neil up

288
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
uh neil you wanted to say a few words

289
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
too so the floor is yours

290
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
is neil with us yeah uh first i'd like

291
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,560
to thank

292
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
dan bonay and the other selection

293
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,240
committee members for giving me this

294
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
award it's a great honor

295
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
to receive the lichen prize for real

296
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
world cryptography

297
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
actually can both of you hold up the

298
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,959
trophy just so that everybody sees what

299
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,240
it looked like what it looks like

300
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
so it's a real thing yeah

301
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
okay thank you yeah please go ahead neil

302
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
what prompted me to think about elliptic

303
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
curves in cryptography

304
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,200
was hendrick lindstra's elliptic curve

305
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
factor's integer factorization algorithm

306
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
which he circulated informally

307
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
in late 1984 it was natural to ask

308
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
if elliptic curves can be used to attack

309
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,279
rsa then perhaps the same mathematics

310
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
can be used in a positive way

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
to construct new cryptosystems

312
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,600
in early 1985 when i wrote to andrew

313
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
edlisko proposing the elliptic curve

314
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,640
group for

315
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,440
discrete log-based cryptography i was in

316
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
the soviet union

317
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
on the academy of sciences exchange

318
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,040
program and had no one there to talk to

319
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
about it

320
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
in the soviet union no one worked openly

321
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
on cryptography least of all with an

322
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
american

323
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
i thought of elliptic cryptography then

324
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
as a cute concept but had no notion

325
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
that it would be widely used in the real

326
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
world in fact i'd been trained in

327
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
in pure mathematics and had

328
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
always assumed that nothing i did would

329
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,600
ever be of practical use

330
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
the person who had the vision to see a

331
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
bright future for ecc

332
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,480
was the late scott van stone he and his

333
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,959
star

334
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,680
student alfred menezes whose phd thesis

335
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
published in 1993

336
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
was the first book devoted entirely to

337
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,120
ecc

338
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
and other co-authors developed crucial

339
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,000
protocols investigative security issues

340
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,959
and lobbied

341
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,839
for ecc adoption the certicom company

342
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,200
co-founded by

343
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
manstone was the main developer and

344
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,680
promoter of commercial ecc

345
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
when i started to attend crypto in 1987

346
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,160
i was struck by the atmosphere of

347
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,720
excitement and the lively

348
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,040
interdisciplinary

349
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,959
interactions something i'd not

350
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,360
encountered at math conferences

351
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
this was a time when open research in

352
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
cryptography was somewhat of

353
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
a forbidden fruit when memories of nsa's

354
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,839
attempt to

355
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
suppress it were still fresh in people's

356
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,320
minds

357
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
concerning directions for cryptography

358
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,079
in the future my hope is that

359
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
researchers who work on real world

360
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,959
cryptography

361
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,079
will reach outside our narrow

362
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
our own professional world and consult

363
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
with people who are better equipped than

364
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
we are to evaluate

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
the human dimensions of proposed systems

366
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
there are real dangers in an overly

367
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
technical approach in real-world

368
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
cryptography as in other areas of

369
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,440
applied science and medicine

370
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
we should always try to adhere to an

371
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,959
internal

372
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
hippocratic oath do no harm

373
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
we see a current example of the problem

374
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
of narrow technical approaches in the

375
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
discussions of app-based contact tracing

376
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,519
for covid

377
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,279
there has been much discussion of

378
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
privacy protection for covid positive

379
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,560
people

380
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
however beyond that huge equity issues

381
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
arise with some of the proposed contact

382
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,639
tracing apps

383
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,800
and they have been largely ignored in

384
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
most of those discussions

385
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
landau who's known among other things

386
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
his co-author with whit diffie of the

387
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
classic book privacy on the line

388
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
has written about these equity issues

389
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
with great insight

390
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,760
so i'd like to conclude by recommending

391
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
her forthcoming book

392
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,399
titled people count contact tracing apps

393
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,360
in public health

394
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
published by mit press so

395
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,279
thank you again for this wonderful award

396
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,880
yep thank you neil well said

397
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
yes congratulations to both of you and

398
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
thank you for uh

399
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
inventing this crucial piece of

400
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
technology that's now pretty much used

401
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,959
everywhere

402
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,480
and actually i really like the fact that

403
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
this uh sort of arcane piece of

404
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
mathematics is now kind of

405
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,320
driving so much security in the world

406
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,279
and menial also

407
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,160
um of course the contact racing is a

408
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,519
huge topic and it's actually going to be

409
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
discussed later on in the conference too

410
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,240
so hope you can you can

411
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
come to that session fantastic all right

412
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,399
so thank you both

413
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
uh and with that let's move to the

414
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
second award so i was really happy

415
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
that we could actually award two uh

416
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
left-hand prizes every year

417
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
and so the second prize this year is

418
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,079
actually given again to a very

419
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,279
influential project

420
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
the tor project which is basically as

421
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,079
you all know the anonymity layer

422
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,680
for the internet and the award is for

423
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
continuing development of the tour

424
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,079
system

425
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,480
and the underlying cryptography let me

426
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
just say a few words about tor before i

427
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,800
hand it off

428
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
to the to the uh the person who's going

429
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,519
to represent the tour team

430
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,079
so tour i guess dates back to the early

431
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,199
2000s

432
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
today tor has something like 2 million

433
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
daily users and as you can see in the

434
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
slide it's actually gotten it has

435
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,839
worldwide

436
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,560
use many people use it all over the

437
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360
world

438
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,880
it's kind of a remarkable thing it's

439
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
used to communicate um

440
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
privately with reporters it's used for

441
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
uh browsing the internet uh more freely

442
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
so it's got it's actually

443
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,839
um quite a successful deployment of uh

444
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,519
cryptography the award is actually given

445
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
to the entire entire tour team so as you

446
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,959
can see tor is actually a very large

447
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,600
collection

448
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
of people but to represent the tour team

449
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
i'm going to invite roger dingledine to

450
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
accept the award on behalf of the team

451
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,160
so roger can you uh please come up

452
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
and uh yeah the floor is yours so say a

453
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,240
few words about where you think the

454
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
community is going

455
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
awesome sounds good is my video audio

456
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,360
working

457
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
yeah we see you you can hear me great

458
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
okay sounds good so thank you

459
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,839
uh this is a great prize to get uh on

460
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,519
behalf of all of tor so i'm

461
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
i'm i'm really happy to be here and i'd

462
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,839
like to uh acknowledge and thank uh

463
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,079
the the various people who helped uh get

464
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,959
us here so

465
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,560
starting with alice and bob alice

466
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
dan mentioned that there are the 2

467
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
million daily users the more

468
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
recent estimate using privacy preserving

469
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
measurement is more like 8 million

470
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,120
daily users so how do you actually

471
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
accurately count

472
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
private users of a privacy system is an

473
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
interesting open research area

474
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
so i also want to thank bob one of the

475
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,279
great things about torah is

476
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,839
bob doesn't have to know that tor exists

477
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,399
you can

478
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,160
interact with websites and other

479
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
participants without them

480
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,680
needing to be part of the tor network in

481
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
order to do that so i also want to thank

482
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
rebecca the relay operator we've got six

483
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
thousand or eight thousand relay

484
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
operators around the world

485
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,680
and don't forget sarah the scientist

486
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
where we've got a lot of different

487
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,759
professors and research groups and grad

488
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,880
students who are

489
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
working on making tour stronger and

490
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,560
safer and better understood

491
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
and while i'm acknowledging people i we

492
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
should probably all

493
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
acknowledge eve the eavesdropper around

494
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,000
the world

495
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and she never really seems to be alone

496
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
these days she's always got

497
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,240
tommy from tailored access following her

498
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,279
around

499
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,399
nobody does passive only attacks anymore

500
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,360
it's all about

501
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,440
a combination of passive and active and

502
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
i guess from there we should

503
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
uh also acknowledge gary the government

504
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,240
agent

505
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
or maybe that's gene chq or

506
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,399
i'm not sure uh quite how to how to make

507
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,920
the name work on that

508
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,079
and we've heard from a bunch of people

509
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,839
in governments that they use

510
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,320
and rely on tor so yeah we think of

511
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
governments as people who are trying to

512
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
tear down security tools but

513
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
uh but they also need their own privacy

514
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,079
and then we should also

515
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,079
think about gina the government funder

516
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,400
we've got uh funding from the national

517
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
science foundation but also from

518
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
the department of defense and the state

519
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
department and the swedish

520
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
equivalent of foreign aid and we've had

521
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
funding from the german foreign office

522
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
and so on so there are a lot of groups

523
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,240
around

524
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
the world who want this sort of thing to

525
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,000
exist and then

526
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
other people we should think about are

527
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,119
like i don't know peter

528
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,240
palantir and bobby blue coach

529
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,280
and cindy cisco and

530
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
all the western corporations that are

531
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
building

532
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
oppression tools that are helping

533
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
countries around the world

534
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
track and surveil and uh and harm

535
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
people i guess another piece we should

536
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
think about is

537
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
ed the whistleblower i'll i'll use that

538
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
uh that that meta syllable for him but

539
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,880
having a lot of people around the world

540
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
learning what's going on in large

541
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
organizations and whether they're

542
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
following laws

543
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
seems like a really useful step and then

544
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
there are a bunch of other people who

545
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
acknowledge

546
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
maybe charlie the citizen lab advocate

547
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,320
or

548
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,760
aaron from accessnow or nathan

549
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
from the ngo world so there are a bunch

550
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,520
of different

551
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
pieces to this ecology ecosystem

552
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,080
and then uh getting back from the meta

553
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
syllable names

554
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,559
uh there are a bunch of people in the

555
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
actual chore world dan showed a cool

556
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,919
picture of them a while ago that was

557
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,320
actually

558
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
maybe half of the tour project

559
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
that was the group of people as gathered

560
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,039
in mexico city a few years ago

561
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,480
so we've got other folks like i think

562
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
nick mathewson might not have made it

563
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,480
into this picture and he

564
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
i think i see paul iverson hanging out

565
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
there next to bruce schneier in the back

566
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
so there are there are a lot of us and

567
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,919
there are even more of us than

568
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,480
are self-identified in the picture that

569
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,120
he's got

570
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
so the the tour project includes a bunch

571
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
of different pieces working on tor

572
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,760
browser

573
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
or censorship or user experience

574
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
community outreach training metrics

575
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,000
mobile censorship measurement secure

576
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
drop tools like onion share that are

577
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
external that are built on top of tor so

578
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,679
there's a cool

579
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,600
infrastructure out there and then dan

580
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,720
wanted me to to

581
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
raise some open research questions or

582
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
open topics so i've got a couple of

583
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
those to end

584
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,400
my little rant speech with one of them

585
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
is

586
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
it's western companies who are building

587
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
a lot of these

588
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
surveillance tools that we're worried

589
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,160
about so you might look

590
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,840
at it from an academic perspective

591
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
you're like well i heard about somebody

592
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,080
in kazakhstan

593
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,520
who's getting censored and you think to

594
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
yourself if only the

595
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
the government there weren't doing that

596
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
but they're buying their stuff from

597
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,440
uh sunnyvale california or israel or

598
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
uh italy or whoever's building it for

599
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,960
them

600
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,840
another thing to ponder the censorship

601
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
feedback loop

602
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
is something that we can look at if

603
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,360
you're trying to use a tool like tor

604
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
in a place where it's censored it

605
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,200
doesn't work and then you change it and

606
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,159
then it does work

607
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
so that feedback loop is something where

608
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
you actually you can actually

609
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
get feedback whereas the surveillance

610
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
feedback loop

611
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
you do something you don't know if

612
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
you're being surveilled

613
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
you change it you don't know if that

614
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,640
helped

615
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
so that's a a messy not so technical

616
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,360
problem that

617
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
that the world needs to think more about

618
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
because i don't know how to do that one

619
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,280
do we need ed to walk out every every

620
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
week with a new set of documents

621
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
about what governments are up to is

622
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
there something we can do that's even

623
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
better than that

624
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
and then a third thought the crypto wars

625
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
are alive and well

626
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
the person before me was talking about

627
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,480
that uh

628
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
the fight a lot of people in the in the

629
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
popular press frame it is security

630
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
versus privacy which we all know here is

631
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
i mean it's really a lot more safety

632
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,039
versus safety it's how do you

633
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,320
how do you have safety while you're

634
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
communicating without letting people

635
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
harm that safety so the front line of

636
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,039
that

637
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
these days is on end and messengers like

638
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
uh whatsapp and signal and it's also in

639
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,919
tour land

640
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,919
and then the last thing to ponder it's

641
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
about power imbalances

642
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
uh there are a lot of powerful

643
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,080
organizations out there

644
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
that have a lot of funding they don't

645
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
need tools like tor

646
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,919
they're already doing well whereas the

647
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
activists and the individuals who are

648
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
trying to make their world better

649
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
and they don't already have billion

650
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
dollar foundations and governments

651
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
behind them

652
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
they're the ones who most need these

653
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,120
security tools

654
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,280
so with that i'm going to hold up my

655
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
cool uh

656
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
levchin prize 2020 award uh jen pointed

657
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,880
out that

658
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
uh indeed is 20 20 21 it's 20 21 but

659
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
uh but nonetheless my living prize

660
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
says 2020 on it so i'll see uh

661
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
how we balance those and with that i'm

662
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
going to hand it back to dan for

663
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
uh whatever's next yep thank you roger

664
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
so hopefully all of you

665
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
managed to open up your cryptics

666
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
um all right so fantastic so this is

667
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,480
this is great

668
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,039
uh so congratulations to all three

669
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,080
winners

670
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
and i guess uh i wanted to say that

671
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
we're always looking for nominations for

672
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,400
the legend

673
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,159
prize for next year so if you go to the

674
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,679
left gen prize site

675
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
off of the off of the real world crypto

676
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,679
website you can there's a forum where

677
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,120
you can actually submit a nomination and

678
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,200
we look at the submissions every year

679
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
to help us choose the num the winners

680
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,039
for next year so if you have someone in

681
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,480
mind go ahead and

682
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,559
submit your nomination don't delay you

683
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,919
might as well do it now because we'll

684
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,120
get to it

685
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,080
eventually um as we as we select the

686
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,440
winners for 2022.

687
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
one thing i will say though is we have

688
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
got a lot a lot of nominations for one

689
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
particular person

690
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
uh and that is uh satoshi nakamoto uh

691
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
which uh is gonna be a little tricky to

692
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
award the prize too so if you're

693
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,520
thinking of nominating satoshi nakamoto

694
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,320
there's probably not

695
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
an immediate need to do that since we

696
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
already have many many nominations for

697
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,960
him

698
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
um okay so uh i think this brings us to

699
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,720
the end of the

700
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
lovechen prize ceremony so thank you all

701
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
we have a break now

702
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
until what is it 10 15 my time but

703
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,840
whatever it is

704
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,240
your time so we have a 40 minute break

705
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,520
at least the program says that we're

706
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,320
going to resume

707
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,360
at 15 minutes after the hour so

708
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
