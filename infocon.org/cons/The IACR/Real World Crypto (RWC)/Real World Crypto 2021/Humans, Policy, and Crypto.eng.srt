1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
i'm also here but i'll wait and you're

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,400
ready to go start whenever

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,720
enjoy your session thank you

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
hello everyone uh welcome to the next

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,759
session as you know

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,000
cryptox is in the real world in the real

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
world uh

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,160
they're humans and humans have a lot to

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,439
do and there is

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,640
more like humans that is also a law

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
background than a social background and

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
in this session we will explore some of

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
these aspects we have two excellent

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,039
talks

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
and the first speaker is katarina and

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
because we're on the schedule i'm not

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,079
gonna say much more catherine

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
take it away thank you very much

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
so i will just share my screen and hope

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,520
that everything

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
everything works properly and i really

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
hope that you can see my slides

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
we can yes oh perfect thank you very

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199
much

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
all right so i'm katarina crompoltz i'm

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
a faculty at the cisper helmholtz center

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
for information security

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,960
inside broken in germany um

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
can you yeah okay perfect so sorry

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
multiple screens everything's new

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
yeah so my name is katarina compuls i

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
lead the usable security research group

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,400
at cispa

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
and i really love interdisciplinary work

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
and i really love building bridges

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
so i would really like to use the next

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
10 minutes to raise awareness for

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
some of my work which is actually

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
human-centric and focuses on how users

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,000
interact with

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,119
security protocols and tools so

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,400
ultimately behind

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
every security vulnerability there

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
stands at least one little human that

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,920
made a mistake

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
and actually if we look at the

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
transition between a concept that we can

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
prove in theoretical research and a

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
product that actually

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
is then out there in the society and

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
that people interact with there are many

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
many other humans involved so

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
we have cryptographers at the more

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
theoretical end of the spectrum and

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,159
maybe protocol designers and api

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,119
designers

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
and then we have software developers

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,719
administrators system administrator

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,200
integrators and some decision makers and

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
then really at the

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
very practical end of the spectrum we

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
have the poor end user who is usually a

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
non-tech savvy person who wants to do

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,038
their best and who wants to make the

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,560
right decision but doesn't really know

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
how to do that

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,040
so how can we now understand the needs

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,239
of all these users

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
and well the answer that i can give you

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
from my human centric perspective

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
is empirical methods so what we really

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
must do is we must talk to them and we

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
must

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,520
more important listen to them so when i

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
was a grad student some time ago

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
i was really curious about where all

77
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
these vulnerabilities

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
in tls come from so i thought it would

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,959
be a good thing

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
to do a user study so my idea was let's

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,000
find out

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
where why there are so many vulnerable

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
https

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
configurations out there in the wild

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,640
well we knew that at that time because

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
we had

87
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
studies based on internet wide scans

88
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
that suggested that

89
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
many of the configurations out there

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
were actually vulnerable at that time

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
so the idea that we had was to do just

92
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,800
um

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
an experiment on the usability of

94
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
configuring https just

95
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
um to give you some more information

96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
about myself i'm a computer science

97
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
uh person so everything comes from a

98
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
computer science background so i also

99
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
um yeah slowly started to adapt these

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
more social sciency methods empirical

101
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,720
methods um to expand my methodological

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
toolkit and to

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
explore this human-centric perspective

104
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,760
so what we did back then

105
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
is we conducted an experiment where we

106
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,879
just let

107
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
um tech savvy people people who are

108
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
really knowledgeable in this domain

109
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
configure https so we gave them a

110
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
scenario and we told them well this is

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,080
what you have to do

112
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,400
um we collected the bash and the browser

113
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
history

114
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
and then along with all this information

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
we implemented a think aloud protocol so

116
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,239
we instructed the participants to think

117
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
aloud and we

118
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
had an experimenter sitting next to them

119
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
who was taking notes and vote on

120
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
everything they said or they did

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
and then also um if whenever we get

122
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
consent we also recorded

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
these people so we have um some audio

124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,760
and video material

125
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
a heist really large stack of

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,599
handwritten notes and then of course we

127
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
had all these um

128
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
virtual machine images and the bash in

129
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
the browser history and then

130
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
when we looked at the data we saw well

131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
are some typical mistakes that those

132
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,760
people make when

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
i'm configuring the protocol and we saw

134
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,918
that actually the

135
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
um type of mistakes that the people in

136
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,960
our study made were actually

137
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
corresponding to

138
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
what we can find out there in the wild

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
and what has been shown by previous

140
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,479
studies

141
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
but the more interesting things uh at

142
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
least from my perspective

143
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
were the findings from the audio tracks

144
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
so not the things that we can see on the

145
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
virtual machine images or in the like

146
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
technical evaluation but more

147
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
the things that the um that the people

148
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,639
said so

149
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,479
um these findings are actually really

150
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,720
striking because what we found was that

151
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
these people were incapable of making

152
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
informed security decisions most of the

153
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,280
time

154
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
so even those who then ended up with

155
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,639
really good configurations of the

156
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,320
protocol

157
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
they just managed to do that because

158
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
they found the right sources online they

159
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
just followed the right tutorials

160
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
and we also really identified some

161
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
severe misconceptions about some

162
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
protocol components so for example

163
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,880
what cypher suites are used for um and

164
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
things like that and then we also

165
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
found some really interesting statements

166
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
like one participant said i'm afraid of

167
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
using crypto and the other one said i

168
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
have no idea what i'm actually doing

169
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:22,960
which

170
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
i think is pretty concerning and this

171
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,400
was also the reason

172
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
um why i was motivated to look a little

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,520
bit um

174
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
deeper into why this problem is there

175
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,800
and why

176
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
this and transition from a like really

177
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,639
nice protocol

178
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,720
a theoretically nice protocol doesn't

179
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
really work so much when we want to

180
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
transfer it to practice or to real

181
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
configurations to really secure the

182
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
internet ecosystem

183
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,199
so then we decided to really look at the

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,000
exact mental

185
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
models that people have of these

186
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
security tools and protocols

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
so what is a mentor model a mental model

188
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,400
is nothing else than just a mental

189
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,759
representation of

190
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
the world that surrounds us humans and

191
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
parts of these mental representations

192
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
can be um nature it can be everyday

193
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
things like this class

194
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
it can be uh other things that i

195
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,840
interact with like my ipad or my

196
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
computer

197
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,199
um and also um it could be actually a

198
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,880
protocol that i'm interacting with

199
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
so everything um has some mental

200
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
mental image i have a mental image of

201
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,240
almost everything that i interact with

202
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
in my head so the question is now how

203
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
can we measure these mental models how

204
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
can we get them out of the

205
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
of the user's heads the the complicated

206
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,919
matter here is that

207
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,319
very often a lot of this knowledge is

208
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,639
not explicit so when we ask humans they

209
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
don't immediately tell us

210
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
what they understand because a lot of

211
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,199
the knowledge is actually tested

212
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,840
knowledge

213
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,599
that users cannot easily articulate

214
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,560
so before talking about how we can

215
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,280
measure this

216
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
um just briefly a summary of the studies

217
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,759
that we did so we did two mental model

218
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,479
studies

219
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
where we wanted to measure these mental

220
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
models one was

221
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,960
on https we had administrators and end

222
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
users real administrators and end users

223
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
and also um we had um a study on mental

224
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
models of bitcoin ethereum or

225
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
cryptocurrencies in general

226
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
also with a actually broad broad

227
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,479
participant pool

228
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
and so what we found and what was the

229
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
reoccurring theme

230
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
here was that there are always

231
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
misconceptions about security benefits

232
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
about protocol components um when we

233
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,000
talk about https

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,479
uh or the study of https we have a lot

235
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,440
of distrust

236
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
in the user interface or in the security

237
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,080
indicators that people get and a lot of

238
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
confusion so some

239
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
participants for example completely

240
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
confused encryption

241
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
and authentication which i think is also

242
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
particularly very some if this comes

243
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,840
from a

244
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
tech savvy person and then when we look

245
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,680
at the mental models of

246
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
cryptocurrencies we have a lot of

247
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
misconceptions about key management

248
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,520
anonymity and bitcoin fees and i think

249
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,639
that also here

250
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,080
the key management part is the

251
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
concerning part because this is really

252
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
an open problem and this is a problem

253
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,319
that creates

254
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,120
a lot of additional burden um to users

255
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
regardless of whether they're experts or

256
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
um or non-tech savvy end users

257
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,919
so let's talk a little bit about the

258
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,479
methodology how such studies can be done

259
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
so first of all we collect data

260
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
then we look for patterns and then we

261
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
develop a theory so

262
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
again i will spare you the detail but i

263
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,599
would like to just

264
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
give you some brief examples how exactly

265
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
these steps can be

266
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,958
performed so um usually

267
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
at least my studies are based on

268
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
qualitative data and this is actually

269
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
also

270
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,279
what most other people do that research

271
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
mental models of of of technical

272
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
um technical things whatever they might

273
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,120
be

274
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
so um for example we use um interviews

275
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
observations um sometimes we let

276
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
participants draw something or we give

277
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,040
them some

278
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
card sorting tasks and as you can see

279
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
here are some examples actually those

280
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
are both examples from um the studies

281
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
that i just talked about about https and

282
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,399
cryptocurrencies

283
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,200
so we have this huge pile of drawings

284
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
along with the

285
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
like audio track um video and audio

286
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
material and then sometimes we have

287
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
photographs of the results from these

288
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
cards card sorting tasks where we let

289
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,519
people

290
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
um use some terminology from the

291
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
protocol and

292
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
um yeah let them find the connections

293
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
between them

294
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
so um this data that we then have is

295
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,519
unstructured data so we have to somehow

296
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,279
make it structured right

297
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
and we do this um using coding this is a

298
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,519
term that is from

299
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
social sciences and this just refers to

300
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
the process of making unstructured data

301
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
structured so we can do this

302
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,839
offline with pen and paper but sometimes

303
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
we do it online it really just depends

304
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,000
on

305
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
the type of data that we have and the

306
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
common goal is that we want to construct

307
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
a theory model

308
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
so then in the end how can such a mental

309
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
model look like well

310
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
again here i will not go very much into

311
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
detail but just to give you an overview

312
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
so what we can see here this is the like

313
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
best case mental model

314
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,839
of https so all the good things that we

315
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,480
um

316
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
we we got from our participants um just

317
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,839
combined

318
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
and what we can see here is that this is

319
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
actually very sparse mental model which

320
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
does not really correspond to the

321
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,399
technical reality so for example

322
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
um a lot of buzzwords are mentioned but

323
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,240
um

324
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
they were not really able to explain

325
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
what they were about or why they are

326
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,800
there

327
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
then well some participants knew that

328
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
there was a certificate authority

329
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,880
involved

330
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
but it was completely um disconnected

331
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,200
from the rest so those

332
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
mental models are really sparse and then

333
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
we also had a worst case mental model

334
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
which has some really well

335
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,399
um strange assumptions so to say so for

336
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
example some people assume that

337
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
there is like a centralized encryption

338
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,279
entity that

339
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
um encrypts all the traffic um that gets

340
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
sent by https and so on so and so forth

341
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,519
so you see it's really

342
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,200
very much different than the technical

343
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
reality so

344
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
why are these mental models like that

345
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
well we first need to understand

346
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
how design and mental models um are

347
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
connected to each other

348
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
so we found in both of our studies that

349
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,959
actually the mentor models were very

350
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
much driven by the user interfaces or

351
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
by the components that people interact

352
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
with so for example administrators

353
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
um mental models were very heavily

354
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
shaped by some specific protocol

355
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,959
components

356
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
and in the cryptocurrency study we found

357
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
that there was actually a significant

358
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
tool bias so people um

359
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
very much um so the mental models were

360
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,519
heavily shaped by the tools that people

361
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,079
used

362
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,200
to manage their um digital assets so

363
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
there is a really

364
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
a strong interplay between mental models

365
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
and design and what we need to do well

366
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
overall we want to have technically

367
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,600
sound

368
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,079
decisions right and we first of all need

369
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,680
to make sure that design

370
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,079
informs mental model in models in a way

371
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,839
that these are at least functionally

372
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,600
correct or functionally sound

373
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
and then on the other hand we need to

374
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
adjust the design to the

375
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
actually sparse and wrong mental models

376
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,880
to still help users to make the right

377
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,760
decisions

378
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
and what i would like to use to raise

379
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
awareness for is that

380
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
all apis all command line interfaces and

381
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,560
all

382
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
metaphors that we use in our designs

383
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
shape mental models

384
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
of any of the people along the spectrum

385
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
from theory to practice

386
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
so whatever command line interface a

387
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,639
software developer or

388
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,240
an administrator interacts with or

389
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,839
whatever api um

390
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
has an impact on the mental model that

391
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
this person

392
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
will create about the protocol so um i

393
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
would like to raise awareness for

394
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
the fact that we should stop making

395
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
implicit assumptions about our users and

396
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,680
really

397
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
start listening to them a little bit

398
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
more and this holds even if they're

399
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,639
experts

400
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,160
and then we need to design security

401
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,079
technology that is better tied to the

402
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
needs and values of their users

403
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
so i'm already at the end

404
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,279
here is just a brief list of some

405
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,200
references for those who are interested

406
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,680
in

407
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
some of the papers related to what i

408
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
just talked about

409
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
and now i'm very happy to take questions

410
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
thank you very much katarina we have a

411
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
couple of questions a very practical one

412
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,320
mashir

413
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
asks how many students how many users do

414
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
you have in your study

415
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
uh yes in our studies well usually

416
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
because those are qualitative studies we

417
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
have a

418
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
smaller number of participants so both

419
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
of these studies were about 30 people

420
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
we are not really interested in

421
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
quantifying a phenomenon when we

422
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
do these studies we really are

423
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
interested in constructing a theory that

424
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
we can then

425
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,079
use to build some hypothesis that we can

426
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
then test with statistics and then

427
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
find causal links and quantify so

428
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
usually here a smaller number of

429
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
participants is enough

430
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,160
usually we recruit participants until we

431
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
reach saturation which means

432
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
that we don't hear anything new no new

433
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
themes emerge

434
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,199
thank you uh more questions martin

435
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
asks on zulip in case you want to go

436
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,600
later on and try to find more things

437
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,839
how do we know that human is the right

438
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
level of abstractions

439
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
and that psychology is the right tool

440
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
for understanding

441
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,760
so why we don't we use employees and the

442
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,600
social situation whether we use another

443
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
level of abstraction in which

444
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
instead of focusing on people but maybe

445
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,760
you're actually already doing that

446
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,040
abstraction because you talk about

447
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,639
developers

448
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
yes so i think that this is a really

449
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
really excellent question because

450
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
this is an ongoing debate in our

451
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
community this is a debate that we

452
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,639
should also have

453
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,440
furthermore so well yes we focus on

454
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,000
individual

455
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
users and already the concept of a user

456
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
is the concept that was somehow

457
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
introduced by people who develop

458
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
technology and yes

459
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
we need to look beyond the user so i

460
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
would say that in this particular

461
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
line of work we are already in the

462
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
infancy so looking at users is one of

463
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
the first things that we do

464
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
some years ago people only looked at end

465
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,399
users

466
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
then we slowly started looking at the

467
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
more like expert type of users like

468
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,000
administrators and developer

469
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
and now the question is where else do we

470
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
go so i think we should go

471
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,880
more and towards theory and look more at

472
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
these types of

473
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
humans that are involved in this chain

474
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,839
but yes we also need it at

475
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,920
other systems like organizations and the

476
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
society as a whole

477
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,079
i think there are really exciting new

478
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,920
research areas out there that still

479
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
needs to be explored

480
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
good so one question from kimberly

481
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
looking at the future

482
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,440
what do you think should be the role of

483
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,959
human factors work

484
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,720
like the studies that you do in the

485
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
decision making process for

486
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,440
crypto standards i think this is a

487
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
really excellent question

488
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
um i think that um well my personal

489
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,759
opinion is i think that this

490
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,040
is a line of work or this is a

491
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
perspective that should be considered

492
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,639
because we can really see and we can

493
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,839
actually measure

494
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
that this is a component that is

495
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,199
important to really understand

496
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,199
why we have so many security

497
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
vulnerabilities out there in software

498
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
or in protocol configurations so i wish

499
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:55,680
that

500
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
um this perspective is incorporated and

501
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
the people

502
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,839
who do interdisciplinary um research are

503
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,560
also

504
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
um involved in the decision-making

505
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
process when it comes to standardization

506
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,959
but i know that it's a very complex

507
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
thing so i know that this is not easy

508
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
and i know that we are running into a

509
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
state explosion probably if we look at

510
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
so many aspects

511
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
and i just have time for one last

512
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
question so i'm gonna peek

513
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,600
with my power of being the chair uh

514
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
sanjit asks is it necessary for end

515
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
users to understand the underlying

516
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,160
crypto

517
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
shouldn't the browsers automatically

518
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
take care of this this is an

519
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
excellent question yes this is a really

520
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,519
excellent question i'm sorry for being

521
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,279
too fast with the answer

522
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,000
i totally agree so um if we look at um

523
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,199
this slide actually

524
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,440
so i think that we should really not

525
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,120
focus so much on the end user because

526
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
why should the end user know things i

527
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,079
mean this is like

528
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
a lot of burden that we put in end users

529
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
so what usually happens is that whenever

530
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
someone more on the theoretical end of

531
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,199
the spectrum or more of the like um

532
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,440
software development side doesn't really

533
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
know what to do then the decision is

534
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,480
immediately shifted to

535
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
to the you know other person in the

536
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
chain which is then in the end

537
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
sometimes the end user and i think we

538
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
should really move away from that so

539
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,839
i also like to talk about umbrella

540
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
conservation i don't know if this term

541
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
is familiar to you it's a term from

542
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
biology where marine biologists say that

543
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
we need to protect the like

544
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
bigger species in order to protect the

545
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
smaller ones and i think a similar

546
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
concept should apply here

547
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
so in order to protect the end users we

548
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,799
should already start

549
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
um protecting the protecting the

550
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
administrators

551
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
the decision makers and the software

552
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,200
developers and maybe designers

553
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
i think that's the right way to go so

554
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,039
thank you very much

555
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,480
sadly we don't have time for more

556
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,799
questions but you have plenty of them

557
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,360
in zulip if you want to go there and

558
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
take care of

559
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
them thank you very much catharina big

560
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,120
applause for you

561
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,679
and if i may ask sarah to come up and

562
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,440
share her slides

563
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,400
yep i'm working on it now

564
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
all right let's move this out of the way

565
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,400
oh wait did that work can you see

566
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
yeah we can see but we can see full

567
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,360
screen and now we see full screen

568
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
all right great i'm missing the little

569
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,039
green box so it's hard to tell but okay

570
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,080
great uh so my name is sarah sheffler

571
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,919
i'm a fifth year phd student in

572
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,240
cryptography at boston university

573
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
i'm going to be talking today about

574
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
compelled decryption in the us

575
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
so this is when courts compel people to

576
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,160
decrypt their own devices

577
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
using their passcode um

578
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
all right uh so i had a whole

579
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
introduction to this written

580
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
using cases from lower courts but then

581
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,520
last thursday there was an important

582
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,559
development

583
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,799
uh which is that a petition was filed to

584
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
bring andrews b

585
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,480
state of new jersey to the supreme court

586
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
so the facts are that a gentleman named

587
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,559
andrews had an encrypted device

588
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,799
he was directed to reveal the passcodes

589
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,080
necessary to decrypt

590
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,400
the device to the courts or else face

591
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,600
contempt of court

592
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
so andrews uh pled the fifth and claimed

593
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
that complying with this order would

594
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
violate his fifth amendment right

595
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
against self-incrimination

596
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,919
so this case is not unique there are a

597
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,440
whole host of these cases

598
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,679
in the lower courts in the u.s and their

599
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,480
decisions

600
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
are all over the map um most of these

601
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
actually ask a slightly different

602
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,200
question

603
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
which is whether you can be forced to

604
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
enter your password

605
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
or even just provide the decrypted

606
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
content of the device rather than to

607
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
reveal the passcode itself

608
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
so today i'm going to describe how we

609
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
use cryptography to

610
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
investigate what the law says about

611
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
these kinds of compelled actions

612
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
so if you think you might end up being

613
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
an expert witness in one of these cases

614
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
i hope this analysis is helpful um and

615
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
also as part of this analysis i'm going

616
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,280
to

617
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
try to bring this into context with the

618
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
rest of the crypto wars

619
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
uh so this work is part of a broad and

620
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
growing field of research

621
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,320
that investigates the interplay between

622
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
law and cryptography so we're interested

623
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
in a two-way street here so one

624
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
what are the legal implications of using

625
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
cryptography and two

626
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
how can we use cryptography to

627
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
understand the law

628
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,440
in the context of compelled decryption

629
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
we'll answer the second question first

630
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
so we'll model the doctrine that is used

631
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,039
to compel decryption

632
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,200
using cryptographic stimulation and then

633
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
we'll use that model to better

634
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,919
understand

635
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,760
the first question of whether somebody

636
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
can be compelled by the courts to

637
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
decrypt their device

638
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,799
um so i apologize our exact model really

639
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,159
only applies in the u.s

640
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
but the way we approach this should also

641
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
apply to analyzing the

642
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
laws of other countries okay

643
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,520
so to do this i'll have to give a bit of

644
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
background on the fifth amendment of the

645
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,320
us constitution

646
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,720
as well as the definition of testimony

647
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,919
so in the u.s

648
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,280
the fifth amendment includes the

649
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,360
privilege against self-incrimination

650
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
but this privilege is not complete it

651
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
only covers certain kinds of actions

652
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
one of the restrictions is that it only

653
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,440
covers actions that are testimonial

654
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,919
so essentially testimonial actions are

655
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
those that reveal the contents of your

656
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,799
own mind

657
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,919
and this could take a couple different

658
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,400
forms the first way an action might be

659
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,240
testimony is if the output of the action

660
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,919
directly reveals the contents of your

661
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,679
mind so if you're forced to write down

662
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,880
how you committed a crime

663
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
that's pure testimony and that's almost

664
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
always covered by the fifth amendment

665
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
meaning you do not have to comply

666
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,039
additionally an action can be protected

667
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,120
even if the output of the action is not

668
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,159
testimonial

669
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
but it's possible to infer something

670
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
about your beliefs based on how you

671
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,799
perform the action

672
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
so for instance let's suppose the

673
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
government subpoenas you to

674
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
produce a gun if you have one your

675
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,320
response to the subpoena implicitly

676
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,400
testifies as to whether or not you have

677
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,960
a gun

678
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
and that implicit testimony is still

679
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,039
protected under the fifth amendment

680
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,720
but there is one additional layer of

681
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
subtlety which

682
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,919
is that the government can compel an

683
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,120
action anyway

684
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
if it's implicit testimonial aspects are

685
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,919
a so-called foregone conclusion

686
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
meaning they add little or nothing to

687
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
the government's existing knowledge

688
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,679
so in my gun example if the government

689
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,520
already knew you had a gun

690
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
now they can likely subpoena you to

691
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,799
produce it and that's likely no longer

692
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,159
protected under the fifth amendment

693
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:04,559
because

694
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,240
even though the action has implicit

695
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
testimony namely whether or not you have

696
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,880
a gun

697
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
it's implicit testimony that the

698
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
government already knew

699
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,799
uh that last part is called the foregone

700
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
conclusion doctrine

701
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
so this doctrine originated in the

702
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
context of forcing people to comply with

703
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
subpoenas for paper documents

704
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
that the government already knew about

705
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
like people would just refuse to uh

706
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
comply with subpoenas for tax documents

707
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,440
um

708
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
and now it's being used to compel

709
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
decryption uh and importantly the

710
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
contents of the documents

711
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,919
uh you know produced are usually not

712
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
protected by the fifth amendment only

713
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,000
the act

714
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
of production of those documents has

715
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
some kind of testimony inherent to it

716
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,640
that

717
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,559
um is protected so if we drill down the

718
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:48,960
core

719
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
question is is the act of using the

720
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,120
password to produce decrypted documents

721
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
a foregone conclusion

722
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
or does that act reveal something new

723
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
and testimonial to the sum total of the

724
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
government's information

725
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
the courts have not determined a single

726
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
answer for this the key question that

727
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,120
they can't agree on is

728
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,039
what testimonial information is leaked

729
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,480
by that act of production

730
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,799
so some courts say that the only

731
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,240
implicit testimony when

732
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
entering a password is the fact that the

733
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,280
defendant knows the password

734
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
others say that if a password is being

735
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
used to

736
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
produce documents then something must be

737
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,000
known about the documents themselves

738
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
that are being produced

739
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
um so in order to try to analyze this

740
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
question further we're going to model

741
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,360
this whole process cryptographically and

742
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
create a formal definition for the

743
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,039
foreground conclusion doctrine

744
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,799
um so the key insight here

745
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,400
is that the definition of the foregone

746
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
conclusion namely that the testimony

747
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,679
adds little or nothing

748
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,200
to the government's knowledge is

749
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,039
actually very similar in style to

750
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,640
cryptographic simulation

751
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
so in our model the government will be

752
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
quiet required to create a simulator

753
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,120
in the crypto sense to simulate the

754
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
compelled action

755
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,600
and we do this in a way that the

756
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,679
government will not need to simulate any

757
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
non-testimonial

758
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,320
results of the action such as the

759
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
contents of the device

760
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,159
so we have a compelled action see the

761
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,840
respondent wants to show that the

762
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,080
compelled action inherently discloses

763
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,000
some contents of their mind the

764
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
government claims that

765
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
it already knows all of the testimonial

766
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
information leaked by the compelled

767
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,240
action

768
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,440
so the idea here is that if the

769
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
government is right that the act of

770
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,760
production

771
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
did not rely on the contents of the

772
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
respondent's mind then they ought to be

773
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,080
able to

774
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
simulate the compelled action using

775
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
everything in the world

776
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,360
except the contents of the respondent's

777
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
mind so we take the world and we split

778
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
it into two parts

779
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,960
the respondent's mind and everything

780
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
else which we call nature

781
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,919
so the compelled action can query both

782
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,960
parts of the world

783
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,279
the simulator can only query nature and

784
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,000
the idea is that

785
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,080
if the simulator is able to produce a

786
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
result that is computationally

787
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,039
indistinguishable from the compelled

788
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,000
actions result

789
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,679
then we will say that that compelled

790
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,559
action was a foregone conclusion

791
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,640
so the next question is what determines

792
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
nature so right the government might not

793
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
know in advance whether a certain

794
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,840
document exists or not so we allow the

795
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,760
respondent to equivocate and set the

796
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
contents of the world

797
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,440
so both its own mind and also nature

798
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
ahead of time

799
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
and this will give the respondent the

800
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,679
power to ensure that the government

801
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,279
can't compel it to reveal

802
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,880
you know any secret documents if it

803
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
didn't already know about them in

804
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
advance

805
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
um and the government simulator should

806
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
work for all settings

807
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
of nature and the respondent's mind that

808
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
are allowed by the evidence right so if

809
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,480
the government

810
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
knows that the respondent has a gun the

811
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,919
respondent should not be able to

812
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
equivocate to a world where it doesn't

813
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,679
have one

814
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
so this is our definition we say that

815
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,279
compelled action c is a foregone

816
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,120
conclusion with respect to the simulator

817
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,240
and the evidence if

818
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,919
for all settings of the world allowed by

819
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,440
the evidence uh

820
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
c and sim are computationally

821
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,640
indistinguishable

822
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,320
and i'll say that to test this

823
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
definition we

824
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
encoded a dozen of the most important

825
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
non-encryption related foregone

826
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,200
conclusion cases

827
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
into this framework uh and we made sure

828
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
that we got the same result as the

829
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
courts on all of these

830
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
various cases the encryption cases are

831
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
sort of too all over the place to make a

832
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
reliable benchmark

833
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
so now we can apply this model to compel

834
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
decryption so the scenario is that there

835
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,279
is a phone

836
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
or a laptop in nature at a known

837
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
location

838
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,000
encrypted with a password that is held

839
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,919
only in the respondent's mind

840
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,159
um so this definition finds that

841
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,960
decryption is generally not compellable

842
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
because decryption generally cannot be

843
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,640
simulated um

844
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
and for the same reason you know this

845
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,240
also applies to similar types of

846
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
cryptographic operations so

847
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
uh decommitments hash preimages and that

848
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
sort of thing

849
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,200
uh but there are certain circumstances

850
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,039
in which the government could simulate

851
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,919
the result

852
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,000
so first of all sometimes there is

853
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,200
testimony from

854
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,720
another witness as to the contents of

855
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
the device right so

856
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,679
essentially this means that the

857
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,279
simulator can produce the result

858
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
directly using the evidence

859
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
uh and doesn't need to work too hard to

860
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,279
simulate the compelled action at all

861
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,880
uh so in our opinion that should allow

862
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
compelling decryption of those specific

863
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,520
files

864
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
uh where there's testimony about them

865
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,600
but not the entire device

866
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,679
another consequence of this definition

867
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
is that it composes with the rest of the

868
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,520
crypto wars in a way that is quite bad

869
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,480
for privacy

870
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
so there have been some suggestions for

871
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
things like a law enforcement key or a

872
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
manufacturer

873
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
key or a device key or whatever that

874
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,799
would allow the police

875
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,039
or the courts or apple or google or

876
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,840
whoever

877
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,679
to decrypt phones as long as they

878
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
possess them physically

879
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
so our definition says that if such a

880
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,200
key existed

881
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
it would actually make the whole

882
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,679
the compelled decryption question a

883
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,200
foregone conclusion and then the

884
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,279
respondent would be compelled to decrypt

885
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,840
the phone

886
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
so it's even worse than it sort of

887
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
sounds you know the existence of this

888
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
law enforcement key

889
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
would force the um would create a

890
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,320
simulator

891
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,679
which would make the result a foregone

892
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,120
conclusion because the simulator would

893
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,919
work

894
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,480
um and that would make the respondent

895
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,440
themselves

896
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,919
forced to decrypt the uh the device

897
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,600
themselves rather than using the

898
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,799
key itself and then last there are a lot

899
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,399
of things we do

900
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,559
that bolster security overall that

901
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,880
actually leave one more vulnerable to

902
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,399
this particular threat of being

903
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
compelled by the government to reveal

904
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,559
secrets

905
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,000
so the security community has been

906
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
trying for a long time for very good

907
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
reason to get rid of passwords

908
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,200
um but it actually seems like there's

909
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
something very special about passwords

910
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
against this specific

911
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,919
uh threat so with that in mind we also

912
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,279
wrote a security definition that

913
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,000
captures

914
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,840
when a protocol defends against this

915
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,760
threat so up until now

916
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,360
we've been thinking about whether or not

917
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
a respondent can be compelled to do

918
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
a current action based on the things

919
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
she's done in the past

920
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,120
and now i want to ask the question let's

921
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
suppose i just want to go about my daily

922
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,000
life and run crypto protocols

923
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,679
i think there's a fire alarm going on

924
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,440
but i'm just going to keep going

925
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
uh is the act of running those protocols

926
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,840
opening me up to being compelled to do

927
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,480
an action

928
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,279
about my secrets in the future uh so we

929
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
call being secure against these attacks

930
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
uh fc resilient and let me point out

931
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,279
that this fc resilience definition is

932
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,000
interesting

933
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,679
even if we pick a different definition

934
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
of the foregone conclusion

935
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,960
uh doctrine itself uh so in our paper we

936
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,679
talk about

937
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,039
fc resilience for several different

938
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
primitives including mpc

939
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
and we provide a construction and code

940
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
for a two pc protocol that receives fc

941
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,880
resilience for one party

942
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,360
uh so fortunately with this alarm going

943
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
on i'm at the end

944
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,799
um for additional details i'm happy to

945
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
chat with you uh email is probably the

946
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,760
best way to reach me

947
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,679
but i did manage to log into the zoolift

948
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,200
chat uh so

949
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,960
i can also hang around there

950
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
yeah at this point i think you should

951
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
react to the alarm

952
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
uh questions are in zulip uh but we're

953
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,360
really concerned about your safety

954
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,279
uh so probably you should follow

955
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,760
you're muted yeah fortunately i only had

956
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
about a minute left but uh i think i'll

957
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,520
i'll respect the fire alarm

958
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,559
and uh try to get the heck out of here

959
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,279
for a little bit

960
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,960
i apologize please people put the

961
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,399
questions into lipstick that she can

962
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,039
come back

963
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,559
and answer the question thank you so

964
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
much sarah we hope

965
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,639
nothing is bad and see you alive soon

966
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,880
okay and with this uh we are more on

967
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
time than what we expected

968
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,520
uh for very unfortunate reasons uh so

969
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
thank you very much for

970
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,279
sticking to the session even if we were

971
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,000
a bit late

972
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,440
put your questions um on uh

973
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
zulib said that sarah can reply when she

974
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,360
comes back and now uh

975
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,840
let's take a break for more crypto
