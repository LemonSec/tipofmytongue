1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,720
if you want to talk without slides

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
just reviewing your video um put

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,040
your raise your hand in in the zoom

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,480
session

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
this will then create a list for me and

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
i will call you and i and then

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,240
amount of time you will get will depend

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
on the number of people in the queue

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
more in the queue the longer the time

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,960
you've got less time you've got

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
less in the queue the more time you've

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
got when you're about to speak

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,800
i will i will ping you in the zoom chat

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
okay if you're in the zoom chat

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,879
i will tell you you're up next and you

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
should put your video on

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,000
so i've got two in the queue so far

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
apparently

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
you might want to say that the raising

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
hand feature is in the reactions button

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
ah in the reactions button yes which is

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
uh i can't remember where that is

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
yes it's on the bottom yeah so you can

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
yeah everyone know where everyone found

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,399
their raised hand

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
of course i don't have ray's hand

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
because i'm but the first person to go

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
is going to be douglas so if douglas

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
could start his video

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
and i have one announcement

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
i have been asking people to rename

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,840
themselves to their full name

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
if necessary i will start putting people

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
in the waiting room so they can't

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,159
participate until they rename themselves

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,520
that's even better there are good

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
reasons why we want you to use your name

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,320
mainly so i can say douglas stabila over

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
to you

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
hi i'm douglas stabila from the

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
university of waterloo

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
so before real world crypto came along

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
the icr conference that was most

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
connected to real world cryptography

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
was probably chess but this year chess

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
aims to take back the title

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
of the most real world crypto conference

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,240
for chess 2021 we're running something

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,720
new

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
the artifact evaluation process every

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
paper that's accepted to chess 2021

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,840
has the option to submit an artifact

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
such as software or data

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
for review the artifact review committee

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,119
will examine

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,919
each artifact make sure that can be

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
successfully executed

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
check that it produces output that could

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
be used to validate the results in the

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,440
paper

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,879
and provide feedback to make the

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,280
artifact easier to use and extend

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
and after acceptance the artifacts will

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
be archived by the iacr alongside the

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,879
paper

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
we've reviewed artifacts for about

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
one-third of the papers accepted to the

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
first issue of chess

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
if you've just had a paper accepted

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
issue two or planning to submit a paper

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
for this friday's chess deadline

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
please keep this in mind for more

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
information please visit the chess 2021

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,160
website's

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
call for artifacts and we hope that more

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,519
icr conferences

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
will take up the goal of reviewing and

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,959
archiving artifacts to improve

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,000
reproducibility

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
and reusability of crypto research

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,519
thanks

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
cool thank you very much and and the

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,040
next

84
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
speaker is going to be philoppo uh

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,959
valsarda

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
over to you hi everyone um

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,040
i'm philippe alsoda i work on uh go

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
cryptography and security but today i

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,000
want to tell you about

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
a personal project i am cheating a

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
little about the

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
only your video thing but this is my

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
webcam

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
[Laughter]

95
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and this is where nigel just cuts me off

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
um

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
so algae or age is a file encryption

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
tool uh and uh format and

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,760
it's meant to be a simple easy to use

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
and modern it's a replacement for a

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,159
specific use case of gpg encrypting

102
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,720
files

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
like your backups uh it has small

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,200
public keys uh that you use directly on

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
the command line or in a

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
file as a list but they're textual so

107
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,440
they're very easy to move around

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
small private keys there are simple

109
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,879
files like

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,480
ssh files it has no config options as it

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
none and it's very composable with

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
unix pipes so you can pipe your tar uh

113
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
command into a gay invocation with this

114
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
recipient

115
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,680
and get take put the output somewhere

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
else or send it over

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
a network or anything like that

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
there are already two independent

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
implementations one in go

120
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,040
and one in uh rust uh written by

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
uh strad jack

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
but more relevantly to this audience

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
there is a

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
specification which i'm working on

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,560
making more formal but

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
this describes how the format works and

127
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,199
uh there is a api that allows anybody to

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
implement essentially a backend you can

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
implement a

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,080
recipient and identity that is based on

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
aws kms

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
or gcp kms or anything

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
ihsm anything else that has keys

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
and we are implementing a plugin system

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,199
that

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,680
over standard output and input allows

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,800
you to implement these

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,479
outside of the process and we're going

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
to use that to implement both

140
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,039
agent and ubc support those are landing

141
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:03,840
this month

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,759
if you want to know more it's a age

143
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,160
encryption.org

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
thank you cool and um before we head

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
over to the next one we've got very few

146
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
people in the queue so please please

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
raise your hand if you just want to say

148
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
anything just like i know thank

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
everybody or just you know

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
wish everybody a happy new year um but

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,080
after the remember after lightning talks

152
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
we're going to go to the social session

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
and nadia and dan are going to be in

154
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
rooms waiting to talk to you

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
um and the next person is going to be

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,800
kobe

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
over to you kobe

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
i'm colby i'm working on the cello proof

159
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
of state blockchain

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
uh one of the unique things that we have

161
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
in cello is plumo which is an ultra

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
fast light clan protocol which is also

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,639
one of the largest

164
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
snark circuits out there it's a growth

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
16 based protocol that's verifying

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
aggregated bls signatures

167
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,080
on very large messages to basically

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
check the correctness of

169
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,080
validator reset transitions so as an

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
input you can imagine you get a valid

171
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,720
intercepted

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,800
genesis block and there's an output you

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,880
get the evaluator set after

174
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
many epoch transitions which can be many

175
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
many days

176
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
so we use some kind of a peculiar

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
structure of a two chain of curves

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
which has been introduced in the past by

179
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,919
the sexy paper

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,479
and so both our circuit is very large

181
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,479
which is like 2 to the 27 constraints

182
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
and the curve is very large

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,759
and which is 761 constraints

184
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
and all of that is meant to say that the

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
setup

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
is of this snark circuit

187
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,280
is very hard to do so in order to launch

188
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
it we're currently performing this mpc

189
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,919
setup

190
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,919
we've built a setup protocol

191
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
and that's using some interesting

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
optimistic methods

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,319
and we'd be happy to have more

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
contributors that are interested in

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
being creative of generating some

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
sources of friendliness and

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,360
also on how to destroy them and yeah i

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
invite you to check out

199
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,160
cell.org and sign up to

200
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,479
launch one of the largest circuits

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
okay thank you very much the next one up

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,840
is

203
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,159
aaron gavilan over to you yaran

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
hi i'm iron villi an independent

205
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,319
cryptography researcher

206
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
and i'd like to tell you about lip swift

207
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,520
it's an open source

208
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
project that i recently released uh it's

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
basically a high performance cc plus

210
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
plus library for the swift secure

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
homomorphic hash function

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
running at less than five cycles per

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
byte on commodity hardware

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
the swift function is collision

215
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,919
resistant and quantum resistant and

216
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
compares well against other secure hash

217
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
functions

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
it is also useful as a building block in

219
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
efficient zero-knowledge proofs and

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,759
post-quantum digital signatures unlike

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
some other available swift

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,319
implementations

223
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
lip switch is production quality well

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,759
documented and tested

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,120
and has a roadmap for further

226
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
development if you're interested in

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,919
building on or contributing to lip swift

228
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,759
or in more details about it please go to

229
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
the github search box

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,560
and look up secure homomorphic hash

231
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
thank you

232
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
cool thank you very much and greg you

233
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
you're the only one in the queue so

234
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
you've basically got 20 minutes to talk

235
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
now greg

236
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,240
if someone else comes up i'm gonna stop

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
you but just keep going off you go greg

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
okay oh i prepared for 30 seconds so

239
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
we might get some time back so i'm greg

240
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
zavarucha from the microsoft research

241
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,200
security and cryptography team uh we're

242
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,719
a team of about 10 people

243
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,360
working on applied cryptography and so

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,399
most summers

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
we hire interns to work with us in

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,760
person here in

247
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
sunny redmond washington but because of

248
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,279
the pandemic

249
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,600
internships were remote last summer and

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
they'll be remote again

251
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
this summer it's not quite the same uh

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
but it's still a good way to work on an

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,920
interesting

254
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
project and meet some new people if

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
you're interested in

256
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
real world crypto post quantum

257
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
cryptography

258
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,680
or securing elections with crypto please

259
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,320
apply

260
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,480
the job posting is online at

261
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,800
careers.microsoft.com

262
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,920
thank you thank you so instead no one

263
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
else wants to give a talk

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
oh my gosh we normally have this huge

265
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,320
long queue and

266
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
so that's no one's got jobs

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
well i can tell you this some people

268
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,360
have jobs because

269
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
as usual i can advertise we've got jobs

270
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,920
in northern you just have to apply to us

271
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
and we can we've got loads of chips oh

272
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,680
suddenly everyone's coming out the

273
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,640
woodwork brilliant

274
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,200
okay so i can i can stop the usual plug

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
for

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,839
we've got jobs and i'm going to hand it

277
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,680
over to

278
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,519
uh felipo felipo can you go next please

279
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
since the queue is empty i figure i will

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
take another 30 seconds of

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
your time to tell you what i forgot to

282
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
tell you about again again

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
as a file format underneath uses a

284
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,640
stream

285
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,040
so the for streaming encryption where

286
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,399
aad is used on

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
uh sequential blocks so it's seekable

288
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
uh and it supports large files and

289
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
something that i'm really

290
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,399
i really want to see i get used for is

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,519
as a building block

292
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
inside other applications so a lot of

293
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
things like backup programs that

294
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,079
go and design their own encryption and

295
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,920
then we have to like go and figure out

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,240
if

297
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,399
they got it right i really wish they

298
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,399
could use aggie maybe with a custom

299
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
recipient type to integrate into

300
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,680
whatever key

301
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,640
system they have and then get streaming

302
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,120
the

303
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
secure encryption uh out of out of it

304
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
it's a library you can see it here it

305
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
has very

306
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
easy to use functions in go and a

307
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,839
similar api in rust

308
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
okay voice gun sorry mikhail alan

309
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,319
rosenberg do you want to go next

310
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
hey um just very quickly uh i'll

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
use my contact info i'm looking i'm

312
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
doing research in anonymous credentials

313
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
with block listing

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,560
um and i would love to hear about people

315
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
who would

316
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
like to use this but find that the

317
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
current implementations or current

318
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,640
systems are too slow for that um

319
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
yeah i spoke to someone who uh who works

320
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,480
on tour

321
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,360
uh i would love to hear uh other

322
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,320
opportunities for this

323
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
okay brilliant um

324
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
does anyone else want to talk whilst

325
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,079
we're talking about this uh

326
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,240
kevin do you want to do you said you

327
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,959
wanted to do

328
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,240
a um yeah k unfortunately k

329
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
log into the same account k can you

330
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,440
launch that poll yes

331
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
i'm in charge now haha and i have

332
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,399
launched that poll

333
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
so we have a po whoa

334
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
well since you were asking about you

335
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,120
know which is the most real world crypto

336
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
conference i'm curious

337
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
how broad a spectrum of conferences

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
people attend

339
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,560
brilliant okay so whilst that poll is

340
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600

and i like it very much but also the

383
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,880
zcash

384
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
foundation is hiring engineers we are

385
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
building a fully

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
rust uh implementation of zcash from the

387
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
ground up and we are almost there

388
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
um we're hiring uh two three more

389
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,240
engineers this year

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
and if you're interested please contact

391
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
me i'm the one tweeting all about real

392
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
world crypto on twitter

393
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
yeah did judries our favorite twitter

394
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
person during real world crypto she's

395
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,160
famous

396
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,800
um it's interesting that only 81 of

397
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
people at real world crypto have

398
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
attended real world crypto although it

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,040
might be

400
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
what it might mean in the past which

401
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
doesn't include yesterday

402
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,279
um is anyone else want to give a talk i

403
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,480
can't see anything

404
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
on the chat chat so

405
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,639
jeff as well uh had his hand up in chat

406
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,160
we'll have his hand up i can't see that

407
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,720
so jeff

408
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
whoever jeff is jeff give a talk

409
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,680
find the uh hand thing all i wanted it's

410
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
actually more of a question

411
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,839
so um there's a piece in a protocol that

412
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,160
we

413
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,440
work on that is a little bit like a

414
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
bittorrent and um

415
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
only a little bit but um so i

416
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
i generally uh want to know if anybody

417
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
has

418
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
thought somewhat more formally about

419
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
bittorrent or

420
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,360
or or can otherwise make interesting

421
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
comments on like what the threat model

422
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,560
really should be

423
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,639
what should people be trying to do there

424
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
i'll just be curious to hear from people

425
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
that's it thank you

426
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
aha i see aha i now see where the hand

427
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,079
of deirdre

428
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
and jeff was thank you thank you is that

429
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,000
it does no one else want to chat oh

430
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
greg's come up again

431
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,839
sorry uh jack and yeah i did actually

432
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,040
have something i wanted to

433
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
to say but i was trying to get the other

434
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
people ahead first um

435
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,680
yeah so the the thing i want to ask is

436
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
like a request for primitive

437
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
um so in one of the things that we

438
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,800
need to do in zcash uh is uh

439
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
detecting inbound uh

440
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,759
uh in inbound distribution of uh

441
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
notes of receive notes that are

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
encrypted on the blockchain

443
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
and the way we currently do that is the

444
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
the obvious and slow trial decryption

445
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,560
process of

446
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
scan everything you see in the

447
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
blockchain and test uh with a

448
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
cha cha 20 poly 1 305 decryption that's

449
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,160
obviously quite slow

450
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
um and is a bit of a bottleneck so what

451
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
we

452
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
the primitive we would like is what we

453
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
think of as a detection key

454
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,639
where we can get we could give

455
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,360
potentially to a more efficient node

456
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
uh something that allows them to detect

457
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,639
that we are interested in something on

458
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,120
chain

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
but not actually reveal to them what it

460
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,160
is

461
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,680
obviously you could do something like

462
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
encrypt a smaller chunk of information

463
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,399
which isn't

464
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
great um maybe you could use some kind

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,720
of cool new accumulator

466
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,279
um or like we we did a little bit of

467
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
look into like designated verifier

468
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,160
proofs um

469
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
as to try to figure something out um we

470
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
haven't really

471
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,079
found anything that's of meets the right

472
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,839
kind of trade-offs in terms of like not

473
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,800
making addresses that much larger or

474
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
like blowing up the blockchain space

475
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
but if anyone has any ideas on this kind

476
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
of thing feel free to contact me i'm

477
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
str4d on twitter or you can find links

478
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,560
on the

479
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
electric coin.co webpage yeah if you

480
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
have any ideas for this or anything

481
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
you're interested in doing uh

482
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,319
let me know thank you very much okay

483
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,959
emil

484
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,439
you're up

485
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,000
emile lundberg oh there you are yeah

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
so yeah to immediately answer that

487
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
question uh that sounds

488
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,919
quite similar to one of the things that

489
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,000
inspired our work on arkg

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,839
namely the i think it's called the dual

491
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,000
stealth key protocol

492
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,840
uh on on bitcoin i think so

493
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
yeah if you haven't looked into that i

494
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
would recommend

495
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
looking into that i can maybe drop your

496
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,600
link somehow that'd be good thanks

497
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,760
cool right no one else

498
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
wants someone wants to know how to get

499
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,360
hold of sophia i think she's usually

500
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
she's often on twitter but i think you

501
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
could also contact her

502
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
on the zulip chat send her a message on

503
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,320
the zillip tracks or even

504
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
send her a message via the zoom chat if

505
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
you really want to do it or

506
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
if she's there yeah she agrees that's

507
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,600
the way to do it
