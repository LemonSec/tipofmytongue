i'll wait and you're okay you'll be good

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,120
to go enjoy

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
yeah all right excellent so um after

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,279
those two invited talks we're now going

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,960
to start the contributed talk

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
uh session on contact tracing uh i would

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,880
like to remind

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
you all there that you should put

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,480
questions into the

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
zulu stream for this session um and also

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
to abide by the iacrs code of conduct

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,680
that you agreed to

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
when you registered for the conference

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
uh the uh

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
we're gonna move over to the first talk

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,119
now which is exposure notification

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,840
system

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,079
may allow for large-scale voter

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,040
suppression

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
presented by rosario gennaro rosario

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,480
would you

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,800
please uh go ahead and unmute and share

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,760
your screen

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
sure let me know if you can hear me well

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
and

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
i can hear you this okay and i hate

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
and you should be seeing i succeed

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,079
now yeah you're not in uh you're right

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,840
i'm going i'm going to go in present

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
mode now

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,640
okay excellent can you see me yeah

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,760
perfect

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
all right so this is joint work with

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
james kralestein uh the prep for all

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,159
cooperative

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
and adam carlstein of symbiont um

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,720
conduct racing in the u.s let me briefly

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
say that in the u.s public health is

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
mostly the domain of the individual

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,680
states

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
we had very bad coordination from the

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,119
federal government

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
therefore individual states were left on

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
their own to develop their kind of

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,400
tracing apps

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
the first one that was launched was

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
virginia in august

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
the state of virginia

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
eventually followed by other states uh

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,360
the last count that i have is about 20

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
of the 50 states

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,159
in the country have apps

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,119
they all followed the guyan framework

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,280
the google and apple framework that

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
was discussed by carmela earlier today

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,040
and now the apps are interoperative

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
between states using a national exposure

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
server which is

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
run by the public health laboratories

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
association

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,640
adoption rate has remained incredibly

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
low these are numbers from november

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
uh you can compare the adoption in the

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,400
us

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
uh with for example ireland in europe

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
numbers are incredibly low this is

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
actually how i got involved

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
i was not following this

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,959
area during the early days of the

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
pandemic but in the summer

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,040
my friends at prep for all were

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
contacted by the linux foundation

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
to help develop strategy exactly to

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
advocate for adoption peripheral

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
is a aids activist and advocacy

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,120
organization

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
they've been incredibly successful at

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
advocating for

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
um prep which for those of you don't

80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
know it's a daily pill regimen that

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,239
prevents

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,159
people from getting infected by hiv

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,120
so there were contacted to sort of ask

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
develops

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,640
and brainstorm and strategies to help

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
adopting

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
these apps and i happen to know some of

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
the people in the preferral community

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
james

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
uh my co-author um asked me and adam

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
who were the tech people to sort of look

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,239
at the design

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
i had not looked at design until the

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
summer

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
and we learned about some of the

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
security risks that we're gonna talk

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
about today

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
and um we decided to approach this more

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
as activism than science so if you're

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,840
looking for

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
novel scientific contribution in the

102
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
stock you're not going to have any

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
as more i'm going to tell you um what i

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,879
did

105
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
in the the particular context of

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
election security

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,280
so um this is uh you've probably seen it

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,480
already in carmela stock

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
but you know this phones broadcast rpis

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,040
there are

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
random numbers they are picked up by

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,720
other phones

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
and if you ever get infected you

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,239
upload the key that is used to generate

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
the pseudorandom number not exposure

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
server

117
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
other phones download those keys and

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
they can tell if they're being exposed

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
or not by matching

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
the rpis that they've recorded for the

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,918
last few days

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,520
um many of you may be familiar with the

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,160
fact

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
that this framework does not protect

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
against replay attacks

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,680
the rpi codes broadcasted by one device

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,919
can be easily captured and rebroadcasted

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,840
in different locations

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
if those rpis become associated with

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
infected individuals

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
then this other people would believe to

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
be exposed even if they actually were

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
not

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
this was well documented in the crypto

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
literature we did not discover

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,440
uh it was well known and

137
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,800
so how do you do that you could launch

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
relay attacks in many ways

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
uh you could have malware on your like a

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,840
rogue up

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,120
that collects and rebroadcasts this uh

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
rpis and i'll talk about that a little

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
bit later

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
there could be a physical attack you can

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
have bluetooth

146
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,560
relay stations that would again

147
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
capture and rebroadcast this numbers

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
you would be able to obtain rpis

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,720
associated to infected people but for

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
example

151
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
stationing yourself outside a testing

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,440
site

153
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
or through a black market um or

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
you know were in the worst case a

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
determined attack could even

156
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
get itself infected turns

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
out actually something that we learned

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
really recently that

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
um the rpis or um sorry this should say

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
actually the

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
text of in fact the people that have

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
been

163
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
loaded into the server do not expire

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
fast enough

165
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,759
and can be used to re-broadcast the rpis

166
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
in other locations so

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
once you load your tech your key on the

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,280
exposure server

169
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
it shouldn't be i shouldn't be able to

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,199
download it and

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,759
and broadcast using that tech because

172
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,039
they will be expired

173
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
but it turns out that there is a narrow

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
window of opportunity there

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
to reuse and recycle those those keys

176
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
um so in all this crypto

177
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
discussion and literature about the

178
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
relay attacks water suppression was

179
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
never mentioned as much as far as i know

180
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,000
we

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,199
but we did find in april a

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
column in the brooking institute

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
magazine about

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,520
how voting voting suppression could be

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
an issue here so we were not actually

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,080
the first

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
to raise this issue and the attack could

188
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
be either on the population

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
um meaning you will you mount a

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,160
large-scale

191
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
relay attack uh targeting geographical

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
areas that are

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
known uh to lean for a particular party

194
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,039
and those people would be notified and

195
00:06:59,039 --> 00:06:59,759
they would

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
isolate and possibly skip voting you can

197
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
also attack the voting infrastructure

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,199
you for example you could target usps

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,319
facilities

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,160
to delay the processing of mailing

201
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
ballots which is already

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,479
happy was already happening during the

203
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,599
last election

204
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
because the usps was swamped by the

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
large number of

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
mailing ballots that arrive so imagine

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
if on top of that

208
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
a large number of employees would call

209
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,360
insect and stay home

210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,720
um this problem is particularly

211
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
compounded by the u.s electoral system

212
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
which is inherently fragile

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
it's very sensitive to small

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
perturbation in voters turned out

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,039
in specific areas there is a classic

216
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
political science paper from 2007

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
the title is republicans should look for

218
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
rain because

219
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
um use lower turnout due to rain uh

220
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
can be argued to have had a critical

221
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
impact on the outcome of at least two

222
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
presidential elections

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
and usually low turnout usually favor

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
the republican party

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,240
um and the question is and this was

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,720
briefly touched by carmela in our talk

227
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
how does a notification of exposure

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
compares to our rainy day

229
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,960
we have no we don't know how people we

230
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,280
have no user studies on the behavior of

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,560
people

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
using this app how would what would they

233
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
do when they get notified

234
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
even in on on election day when they're

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
it's their civic duty to go both

236
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
would they stay home wouldn't stay home

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
we don't know but we know

238
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
that even something as simple as rain

239
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
such a high effect on the election um

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,959
so what would be as a sexual attack

241
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
obviously one that would suppress enough

242
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,920
vote to flip

243
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
the result of the election but an

244
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
effective attack might just

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
be sufficient to delegitimize the result

246
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
by injecting

247
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,920
enough doubt and mistrust in the

248
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
electoral process

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
in that sense a small scale attack might

250
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
be sufficient and i'll talk about that a

251
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,519
little later in the talk as well

252
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,839
so what do we what do we do again we

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,120
were not interested

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
in publishing paper and getting press

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,160
and

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
do any of that we just wanted to sort of

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,279
raise

258
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,760
uh concern about this issue we wrote a

259
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
note

260
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
we privately circulated among security

261
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
and catholics are in public health

262
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,839
activists

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
we sent it to google and apple and

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
actually google and apple were very

265
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,399
responsive to this

266
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
we got several meetings uh with both

267
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
technical teams and

268
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
you know sort of discuss what the issues

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
were

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
and our main goal we didn't want to

271
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
you know get the apps off the market we

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
didn't want to

273
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,560
disrupt this attempt of using technology

274
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
to help

275
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
combat the pandemic we knew that it was

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
important to keep trying

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
um to use this apps but we sort of

278
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,080
advocated for a very

279
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
simple patch would have been to suspend

280
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
notification for a few days before

281
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
election day

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
we thought this was very minimal

283
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
approach it would have had

284
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
very minimal public health implications

285
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,320
and it would have basically

286
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
removed the threat that we were

287
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
considering

288
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
um eventually our nerve was picked up by

289
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,880
the media was

290
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,160
and it became public again

291
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
and they're led me to submit it to to

292
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
the rwc

293
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,279
um the criticism why we're not

294
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,839
we were not somehow taken serious so

295
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,640
this was not

296
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,560
considered uh a

297
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
reasonable threat the idea that the main

298
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
response that we received from google

299
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,959
apple and

300
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,440
many in the academic community was this

301
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
was not a rational path for the

302
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
adversary that if you want to let people

303
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
to stay home

304
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,360
you can do much more

305
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
much easier simpler things for example

306
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
spread misinformation on social media

307
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
about your polling station being

308
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,519
infected of a large you know um

309
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,800
that's actually was one of the

310
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
suggestions brought up

311
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
and um i i find that

312
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
to be kind of a uh difficult argument to

313
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,000
sort of

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
uh digest what i would

315
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,640
think that i want to say is that here

316
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,720
fake news and this information on social

317
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
media is

318
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,319
a fake um

319
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
it's a non it's something that is not

320
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
true that is

321
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
made to look like it's true and reliable

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,240
here is the opposite here

323
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
is an official government communication

324
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,680
channel

325
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
is being tampered with and is being made

326
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
made to give incorrect information i

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,160
may not be an easy target of

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
misinformation campaign on facebook

329
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
but i will believe my my my app

330
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,040
when it tells me that i've been exposed

331
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
so it opens up

332
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
a whole new way of reaching um

333
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,850
targets that may not be successful to

334
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,040
[Music]

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
fake misinformation on social media

336
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
there were several counter measures to

337
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
large-scale relay attack

338
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,639
and some of them are you can go to the

339
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
risk of mitigation faq

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
in for gyan and the first one is

341
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,200
you know only uh

342
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
in fact the people can

343
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
can upload tax and so you cannot create

344
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,279
this large-scale relay attack which i

345
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,120
found to be inadequate

346
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
because as i said there's many ways that

347
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
you can put your hands on the infected

348
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
rpis of infected people

349
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
in particular this last attack that's

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,320
been recently discovered

351
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
that you can recycle the the keys

352
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,880
you can monitor from for um drop in the

353
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,639
test positivity rates you know if a lot

354
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
of people get notified a lot of people

355
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,560
get

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
tested and you'll notice that there's

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
something not

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
consistent with the epidemiological

359
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
models but that's completely useless in

360
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
the case of butter suppression because

361
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,360
that will

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
happen maybe by the time you notice the

363
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
election is coming on

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
um you could stop malware from

365
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
broadcasting rpis and this is actually

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
something that when we started

367
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
discussing this we were not aware that

368
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,920
apple for example

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,200
reserves the bluetooth uid

370
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
uh only to this particular guyan app so

371
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,920
it's basically impossible on a on ios

372
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,240
to uh force or create a rogue app that

373
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
pretends to be a guy in uh broadcasting

374
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
a beacon um that's actually not

375
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,160
that and on android that that the

376
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
confirmation does not exist

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
but they have a very strict review

378
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
process in the google play store that

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,279
should stop

380
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,240
this kind of malware from being rosario

381
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,720
we've

382
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,279
got we've got to go to q and a in like a

383
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,320
sec so

384
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
okay let me give you one a couple and

385
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
anyway let me just say that um one more

386
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
thing

387
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
were they using the recent elections

388
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
there is no evidence to that

389
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
thank you thank goodness uh probably

390
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
because of the low adoption

391
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
um and but i do think that we did dodge

392
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,000
a bullet

393
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,530
in particular because um

394
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,240
[Music]

395
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,639
uh because the legitimately of the

396
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,160
election has been successfully

397
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
questioned in the mind of many people

398
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
and if there had been even a small

399
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,600
attack uh

400
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
that had been proven to happen that

401
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
could create enough evidence

402
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
uh to um

403
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,160
to to foster this doubts and

404
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,760
and and create this doubts so

405
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
again why not suspend notification we

406
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
think it was a pr

407
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
issue and let me close with some lessons

408
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,519
um i believe there's been a lot of talk

409
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:01,920
about

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
centralized versus decentralized but for

411
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
me the question is

412
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
security versus insecurity and public

413
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
health is one of the most important

414
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,600
roles of government

415
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,079
and yes we have to protect the privacy

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
of

417
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
of the individuals but we also need to

418
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
protect the official communication

419
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
channels that go from the government to

420
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,040
the

421
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,839
citizens and not leave them open to

422
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,560
tempering

423
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
and okay and i'm done

424
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,519
great uh thank you uh i see two uh

425
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
quick questions in the chat uh which

426
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,920
maybe you can adjust very briefly here

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,800
before we move on

428
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
since we're a couple minutes behind a

429
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
question and i'll give you both of them

430
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
uh how much worse with the spamming

431
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,920
would would this be than spamming phones

432
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,279
with text messages

433
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,480
claiming to be from the department of

434
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
health and then the second question

435
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,199
is is the tax dollar risk of most people

436
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
vote by mail

437
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
so uh no so the the first one is again

438
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
i i believe that if you

439
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
hold on if you um

440
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,959
are doing uh receiving some text

441
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
messages claiming for to be from the

442
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,959
department of health you can call back

443
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,480
the department of health and

444
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
verify that they're sending text

445
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,079
messages again

446
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,880
there are ways to for people who are

447
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,600
interested

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
to figure out that you're dealing with

449
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
with a spam phone call on the other hand

450
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,199
this is the official app

451
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,160
of the of the there's a qualitatively

452
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
difference between

453
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,000
spam text messaging spam email and an

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
official government

455
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
app regarding voting by mail

456
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,199
um if or early voting for example here

457
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,560
in your state we have

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,240
early voting and um

459
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
um we um

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
we could vote for two weeks before

461
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
election so those are

462
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,199
all very good uh possible confirmations

463
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
to this issue um but again

464
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,839
um the large number of uh ballots are

465
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
casted on election day

466
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,959
and again you need a very small

467
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
drop in turnout to have an effective

468
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,119
attack and again remember that a

469
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
successful attack

470
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,319
could be the one that just create a

471
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
perception that something went wrong

472
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
and not that something actually went

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
wrong great thank you thank you rosario

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
we'll we'll take the remaining things to

475
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
the to the zulu chat and perhaps

476
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
continue the conversation there um we're

477
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
running a little late so i need to move

478
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,200
on so i'll

479
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,559
if uh you start screen sharing that's

480
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,000
great our next speaker

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,799
uh privacy preserving bluetooth based

482
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
contact tracing one size does not fit

483
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,679
all

484
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,240
presented by ayala ronan hi al please go

485
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,120
ahead

486
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
thank you can you hear me yes and i can

487
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,039
see your slides

488
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,760
yeah great okay so thank you this is the

489
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,280
joint work together with

490
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,320
benny pincus and many other

491
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
people that contributed to the design

492
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,080
implementation

493
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
deployment and now deprecation of vla

494
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,559
contact racing in

495
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
israel and i want to start with a little

496
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
bit background of how contract testing

497
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,720
was

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
done in israel and in the beginning of

499
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,039
the epidemic

500
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
as a in many other countries we started

501
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,360
doing a manual epidemiological

502
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,400
interrogations

503
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,120
where infected persons will ask about

504
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
non-contact so they can be notified

505
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
and what is maybe more unique to israel

506
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
and those

507
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
persons will also ask about public

508
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
locations where they visited for example

509
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,280
supermarkets or public transportation

510
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
and a full list of those locations and

511
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
the exact times

512
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
where they were visited it was published

513
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,760
in the beginning

514
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
actually in newspapers and then in

515
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
dedicated their website and telegram

516
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,679
channels

517
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,520
and people could just read and see if

518
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
they were in their close

519
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
vicinity of infected person and this is

520
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
something that might look a little bit

521
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,200
strange to people because it reveals

522
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
quite a lot of information about those

523
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,000
infested people

524
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
but i feel that in israel it was um

525
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,120
generally

526
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,080
uh accepted in the consensus and i think

527
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,400
this

528
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,679
comes from some social norm people don't

529
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
hide this kind of things and actually

530
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,600
when someone is confident in positive

531
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,720
everybody in this um

532
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,280
everybody knows him is going to know

533
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
about it one way or the other this is

534
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,600
just the way

535
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
things are if we like it or not and as

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,880
an example

537
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,559
this is the official website by the

538
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,400
minister of health and you can see that

539
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
um today in 8 28 a.m israel time

540
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,200
and the first person visited a coffee

541
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
place called the

542
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
uchilda now this is something that of

543
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
course doesn't scale up people can't

544
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
read the all of the locations of

545
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,280
hundreds of

546
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,679
or even thousands of university persons

547
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,720
per day

548
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
and um relatively in the beginning the

549
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
israeli government

550
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
made a very controversial decision to

551
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
actually use

552
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,280
a counter-terrorism tool of the security

553
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,080
service

554
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
to treat people and to notify people if

555
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
they were in close

556
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
vicinity to um confidence in positive

557
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,760
persons

558
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
and this is that is presumably we don't

559
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
officially know

560
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
it's based on data from several

561
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,480
companies and

562
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,159
it's something that is done without

563
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,159
anyone's consent

564
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,000
and if you get notified which is done by

565
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
an sms message

566
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,919
you are required by law to self-contain

567
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,559
for the

568
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,760
required amount of time and a part of

569
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,559
the

570
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,520
various privacy and ethical issues and

571
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
this tool is also not very effective

572
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
there's a very large number of false

573
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,919
negatives a lot of people out there

574
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,720
identified

575
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,039
and there's a very very large number of

576
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,919
false positives

577
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
people are um asked to become or forced

578
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,520
to be guaranteed

579
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
without any reason there's a large

580
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
number of appeals that have been

581
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,520
accepted

582
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,240
and generally um people don't like this

583
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,880
tool for

584
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,559
a lot of really good reasons um now

585
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,919
um benny thought this situation

586
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,000
what can we try to do about it and it

587
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
seems that the natural reaction of any

588
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
cryptographer in the world

589
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
that time is to try to design a barely

590
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,120
contact racing scheme

591
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,559
and now we started working out about in

592
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
march and we also came up

593
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
like many other people with a

594
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
decentralized solution that we call the

595
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
ashumen or the protector in hebrew and

596
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,760
this is a

597
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
solution that was actually tailored for

598
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
the specific requirements of the israeli

599
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
ministry of health

600
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
and it has some significant differences

601
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
significant similarities similarities

602
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,919
and differences from

603
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,799
um the tcp for example we do protect

604
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,440
against

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,520
relay attacks we have other ways to

606
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
generate and

607
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,159
even reduce specific keys and times but

608
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,000
for all of this cool school

609
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
details i invite you to go and actually

610
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,760
read the full white paper

611
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
and what i want to focus on today are

612
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,440
specific trade-offs

613
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
that we actually did done very

614
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
differently from

615
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
this rept and try to explain why we did

616
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,679
this

617
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,679
and further the maybe one of the most

618
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,720
important tradeoffs

619
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,799
is the way that we want to protect the

620
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,480
infected person's privacy

621
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,159
compared to what kind of explanations

622
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,559
we're going to give to the users

623
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,039
now and as we already know this point

624
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,520
if i get notified that i was in close

625
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,400
contact

626
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
with someone and for example in the last

627
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
14 days i only met one person

628
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,720
this will automatically reveal to me

629
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
which the infected person is going to

630
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
um like his identity and this security

631
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,919
tries to handle this type of

632
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
issues by giving the minimum amount of

633
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
information

634
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
needed for people to for people which

635
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,960
basically

636
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
means they're going to tell what is the

637
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,000
day that you

638
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,159
were in contact so know how many days

639
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,480
you need to self-isolate

640
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
and this basically

641
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,400
has an implicit assumption that people

642
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
are going to comply

643
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
with this requirement to surface right

644
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,919
they're going to have a lot of trust in

645
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,720
the system

646
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
and they're going to accept the risk of

647
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
a false positive

648
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
the first positive might happen because

649
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
there is some bug or error in the system

650
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,320
it might be because i was studying three

651
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,039
meters

652
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,080
away from uh someone that was infected

653
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
but it was outdoors we didn't talk with

654
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,559
each other

655
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,480
but the ability connection was strong

656
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,919
enough and i would not have the

657
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,960
information to know

658
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,840
if this was the situation or if i got a

659
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,640
contact from

660
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,280
another closed meeting in an office on

661
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,240
the other extreme

662
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
end we might actually say people okay

663
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
this is the full information

664
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
this is the exact time when you are

665
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
exposed this is the instructed person

666
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:32,960
that

667
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
you were exposed to and this is the

668
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,240
specific location this gives you

669
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
all of the information you can get about

670
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
a specific contact

671
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,640
and we decided to take the middle ground

672
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
basically and give the amount of

673
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
information we think

674
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
that people in israel with the long

675
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,120
history of uh

676
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,080
false negative and false um announcement

677
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,640
uh

678
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
announcements like that will agree to

679
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
comply with this uh

680
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
notification which means we're going to

681
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,039
give you the approximate

682
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,200
time of contact and so we try to

683
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,080
understand if this is

684
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
uh the times where you are in the

685
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
supermarket or

686
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
you are at home or some other place that

687
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
you know you're okay

688
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
and we do notice that this mean

689
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
implicitly means

690
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
that and user might learn the the

691
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
location because we might know where we

692
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
want they might have local gps

693
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,640
history and we believe this this

694
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
tradeoff that is required for

695
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
this replica should actually work in

696
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,840
inside another interesting

697
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,880
trade-off is about um locations

698
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
if we if do we want to store gps

699
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,000
location

700
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,960
this is a trade-off with coverage and uh

701
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,679
we always

702
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,919
understand by now that with for contact

703
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,880
testing we don't need to know the

704
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
locations we just need to know the

705
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,440
contact graph of

706
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,760
the instructed persons and we do it by

707
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,039
assuming everybody has

708
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,720
smartphones we're going to communicate

709
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,159
in billy and we're going to identify

710
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,279
contacts

711
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
however we have a problem if some of

712
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,559
these people

713
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
don't have a smartphone and have a very

714
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,600
old or a

715
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,240
dumb phone that doesn't support this

716
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,120
technology

717
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
and specifically in israel there's a

718
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
very large because of the population

719
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,880
do not own smartphones for example for

720
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,240
religious religions

721
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,720
and then this old scheme doesn't include

722
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,440
them

723
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
and we need to find a way to cover them

724
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,120
and actually

725
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
very early on um the israeli minister of

726
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,559
health developed a decentralized

727
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,799
gps based solution that basically

728
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
downloads the list from the website that

729
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
we've seen before

730
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
and then try to compare this location

731
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
with your own local

732
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
gps story and see if you will close

733
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,360
vicinity to anyone that was

734
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,159
uh infected this gives a no local alert

735
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
nothing believes the device

736
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,880
it was actually um very accepted by many

737
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
privacy and security

738
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
experts in israeli and everybody while

739
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,159
really really happy

740
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,559
and the main problem is that apart from

741
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
the cost of the manual integration

742
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,799
is that gps has very low accuracy

743
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,919
especially in buildings

744
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,760
and again we have a lot of false

745
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
positives

746
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,039
however on the other end with billy

747
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,400
which is no echo

748
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
but has only partial coverage in this

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
population so you can assess

750
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
why not to do both and the main problem

751
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,919
with doing both

752
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,120
is googling google netfl will not

753
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,480
let you use the um jna

754
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
api if you want to store local

755
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
information this is even if this is

756
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
for decentralized the local usage even

757
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,919
when the app is voluntary

758
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
even when the using location data is

759
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,240
voluntary inside the app

760
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
and this is even when as we have google

761
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,279
might be actually

762
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
collecting this gpa information by

763
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,520
itself this was basically a deal breaker

764
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
for the minister of health

765
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
they couldn't agree to lose this a large

766
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,559
part of the population we talked a lot

767
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,279
with google

768
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,440
that the people tried to make them see a

769
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
point of view and

770
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,159
it didn't work and so after

771
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,679
a few months after a month or two

772
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,919
minutes remaining okay

773
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,000
and still we're able to develop

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
a new application that bypassed the

775
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
current limitation that we know

776
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
and um and you can see the design

777
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,159
references it was again endorsed by all

778
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,919
of these already private experts

779
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
everybody was happy and the problem is

780
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,679
that unlike him again

781
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,919
one that was actually downloaded by a

782
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,880
lot of people

783
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,799
the public simply didn't install the app

784
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
it was a colossal fellow and it was

785
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,760
recently deported you cannot herself

786
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,799
want it wrong

787
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
and there were some technical issues by

788
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
not using ngen

789
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
but the main reason is that we try to

790
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,840
design and implement a good

791
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,480
privacy preserving scheme but it doesn't

792
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
mean that the public

793
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
understood this and there's a general

794
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,559
distrust of the government and the

795
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,240
minister of health country the way that

796
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
they respond to the

797
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
covenant crisis and the

798
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,159
usage of the security service tool was

799
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,120
something that

800
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,399
made people unable to understand what is

801
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,159
different between this application

802
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,960
and the other thing and actually part of

803
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,399
the government wanted this application

804
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,360
to fail because

805
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,080
it enables them to justify using their

806
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,679
security service as

807
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,919
uh for contact pricing which was much

808
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,600
much easier

809
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,559
so in conclusions um i feel that we need

810
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
to find

811
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,760
better ways how to communicate these

812
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,159
complex privacy issues to the public to

813
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,760
allow them to make much more informed

814
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
decisions we need to understand that

815
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,440
different countries have different norms

816
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
regarding privacy security and different

817
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
priorities

818
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,039
and we can't just force everybody to um

819
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,320
in the world to

820
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
do what we think is right for ourselves

821
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
and i want to believe that google and

822
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
nfl actually care about users privacy

823
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
and i support the fact that they don't

824
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,679
want the centralized solution for

825
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,399
example

826
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,760
but the way that they help the

827
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,679
government to use their

828
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,760
own products without any modification is

829
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,720
problematic

830
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,200
it leads to much worse tools and it

831
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,279
prevents any possibility of complete

832
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
computational variation of uh of other

833
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,320
solutions

834
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,760
i'm going to think about it in the

835
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
larger scope

836
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
and um i will be in that i'll be happy

837
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,360
to answer any questions and recommend

838
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,840
you to

839
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
wear a mask with your social distancing

840
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
and wash your hands often as possible

841
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
thank you great thank you very much al

842
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,799
um i see one question in the chat

843
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
from ari trachtenberg did hum again i

844
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,120
hope i pronounced that right

845
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,399
expose the gps data of infected users

846
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,240
to the rest of the country no

847
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
okay great all right um we're gonna

848
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
we're gonna now go on thank you very

849
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
much uh we're running a little bit

850
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
behind so we're gonna go on to the next

851
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,960
session

852
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,880
and i'm gonna just give everyone a heads

853
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,799
up that at the end of the third talk

854
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,000
before we go to break

855
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,080
um kevin's got a poll that we're gonna

856
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,039
put out at the end

857
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,600
uh so just stick around for the poll uh

858
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,559
right at the end

859
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
our our last talk is titled privately

860
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,799
connecting mobility to infectious

861
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,679
diseases

862
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,399
via applied cryptography and will be

863
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
presented by lucas helmer

864
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
lucas i see your slides please go ahead

865
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
and start your talk

866
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,240
lucas are you i can't hear you

867
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
he's still muted brian lucas you're

868
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,200
muted

869
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:22,000
i can't see him yeah oh there he is

870
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,120
uh lucas you need to unmute or k or

871
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
kevin can you unmute him

872
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,640
i can only ask him to unmute um

873
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
which he may not be able to see while

874
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,840
he's sharing screen

875
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
ah okay um

876
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,679
so now it's working yes now it is thank

877
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,360
you

878
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,399
perfect please continue

879
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,919
okay so i'm really happy to tell you

880
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,840
about some work that i've been doing

881
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
together with my colleagues alexander

882
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,159
bancolitis alessando bruni

883
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
daniel carles christian reichberger and

884
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,679
roman vargas

885
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
we came up with a solution that connects

886
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,679
mobility data to infectious disease data

887
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,120
in a privacy preserving way

888
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
our approach is orthogonal to contract

889
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,559
tracing apps

890
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,200
so we do not require smartphones and the

891
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,760
data

892
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,559
is already available available and

893
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,840
collected by mobile network operators

894
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
our solution gives a big picture of a

895
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,000
current outbreak and about future

896
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,440
directions

897
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,159
in contrast we cannot do contact racing

898
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,600
with our protocol

899
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
so we do not see individual infection

900
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,679
with it

901
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,559
it is long known that human mobility is

902
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,279
a critical

903
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
factor in infectious disease

904
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
so to better understand human mobility

905
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,480
directly translates to into a better

906
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,679
understanding

907
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
of a dynamic of an outbreak

908
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,320
and 10 years ago researchers started

909
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
to use mobile phone data to model this

910
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
mobility

911
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
mobility patterns the outcome were what

912
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,880
you see on the slide

913
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
heat maps where you can see where the

914
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,279
outbreak was originated and where it

915
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,159
will be probably spread

916
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
and this was verified uh with for

917
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,480
various diseases like

918
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
like malaria dengue or cholera

919
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
and so far researchers aggregated

920
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,320
mobility data

921
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,640
of all subscribers of a particular

922
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,279
mobile network operator

923
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
and this worked quite well but they had

924
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,559
issues when there were relative few

925
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,200
cases

926
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
so if you're in the beginning of a

927
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
pandemic or in the beginning of the

928
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
second or third wave

929
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,559
and in addition they had problems if

930
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,320
there were unexceptional events like

931
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,399
mass gatherings

932
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,519
and our solutions our protocol uh

933
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,320
wants to close the gap and also be of

934
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
utility if the

935
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,039
cases are relatively low

936
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,200
and for this our proposition is that we

937
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,519
aggregate mobility data

938
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
only of infected individuals and

939
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:04,960
therefore

940
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
this should lead to a more accurate

941
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
picture about the current outbreak

942
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,279
this seems rather obvious so why wasn't

943
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,279
this done so far

944
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,760
and the reason is because of privacy

945
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
concerns

946
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
and our protocol should overcome these

947
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,480
privacy concerns

948
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,600
and the solution is cryptography and

949
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
more concretely we are using several

950
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,919
privacy enhancing technologies and the

951
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,320
most

952
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,840
important one is homomorphic encryption

953
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,159
so through homomorphic encryption we

954
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,480
will protect the patient's identifiers

955
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
but we are then still able

956
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
to do something useful with the data

957
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
also we are applying some share

958
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
knowledge like proof techniques

959
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,559
so that for example we can ensure that

960
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,279
the

961
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,440
aggregation has a certain minimum size

962
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,320
of individuals

963
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,480
and we are also relying on differential

964
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
privacy as

965
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,720
previous attacks has shown that only

966
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,559
aggregating location data

967
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,760
is not enough for privacy

968
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,879
now to the protocol how does it work on

969
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,879
the left you see the researchers

970
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,839
that have a list of individuals that are

971
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,599
infected with their ids

972
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,760
here depicted with their phone number so

973
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,239
their mobile phone numbers

974
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,960
the first thing the researchers do is

975
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,359
they

976
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
encrypt the list with homomorphic

977
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
encryption

978
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,520
once they have done this they send it to

979
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,000
the mobile

980
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,679
network operator and the mobile network

981
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,839
operator has its own database with all

982
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,359
his subscribers

983
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,520
and the associated location data

984
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,719
and all the computations on the mobile

985
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
network operator side

986
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,960
happen in the homomorphic domain this

987
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
means that the

988
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,119
ciphertext so the list of infected

989
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,280
individuals never gets decrypted in the

990
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,599
whole process

991
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,000
first thing the operator does he

992
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
validates the request

993
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,079
that's what i said that he looks if

994
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,520
there are enough people

995
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,200
in this uh in this list of infected

996
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,040
individuals and he does this

997
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,079
with techniques that come from bullet

998
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,040
bruce because he cannot look into the

999
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,119
this list because it's encrypted through

1000
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,520
homomorphic encryption

1001
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,920
and then comes the data aggregation this

1002
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,640
is the core

1003
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,000
of the protocol here the

1004
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,320
mobile network operator computes the

1005
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
heatmap

1006
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,160
and technically this is a vector matrix

1007
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,920
multiplication

1008
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,720
where vector represents all the

1009
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
subscribers of the particular mobile

1010
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,400
network operator

1011
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,040
and where a one indicates that this

1012
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,520
subscriber is infected and the zero that

1013
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,119
it is not

1014
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,200
and the matrix on the other side so the

1015
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,599
mobility matrix

1016
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,560
is from the mobile network operator and

1017
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
one entry in this matrix

1018
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,920
tells you about how about the amount

1019
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,079
that one individual spend in a

1020
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,000
particular cell down

1021
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and if you multiply this you get the

1022
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,280
aggregation

1023
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,079
of the location data of all infected

1024
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,000
individuals

1025
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,920
and in the end the mobile network

1026
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
operator adds

1027
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,839
some noise to this heat map and once you

1028
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,800
have done this

1029
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,400
he can send it back to the researchers

1030
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
and see this is still encrypted so the

1031
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,000
mobile network operator

1032
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,960
never sees this heat map but the

1033
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,720
researchers have the private key

1034
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
to decrypt the heat map and get the

1035
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,599
result

1036
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,480
now to the real weakness of the protocol

1037
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,440
because usually

1038
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
homomorphic encryption is very expensive

1039
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
so

1040
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
is this protocol even feasible on a

1041
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
large scale

1042
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,440
and yes it is it

1043
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,160
took us less than two hours or

1044
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
equivalently

1045
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,560
ten dollars on aws to compute the heat

1046
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,000
map for

1047
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
small nations like austria or big cities

1048
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
like singapore and new york city

1049
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,960
since our protocol scales linearly in

1050
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,520
the dimension of the mobility matrix

1051
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,200
it is even efficient for larger

1052
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,680
countries

1053
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,720
what about security in a nutshell we get

1054
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,119
semi honest security from you by using

1055
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,200
homomorphic encryption

1056
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,119
but we think that it is not enough to

1057
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,200
have semi honest security when we are

1058
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,119
dealing with medical records and

1059
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,599
location data

1060
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,040
so we added some few technical measures

1061
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
and could prove that we have privacy

1062
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,480
against malicious adversaries

1063
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,240
what does this mean concretely for our

1064
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
protocol

1065
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
it means that even a malicious

1066
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,520
mobile network operator that one that

1067
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
deviates from the protocol

1068
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
can get any information out of the

1069
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,599
vector so that he can

1070
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,920
see if one of his subscribers is

1071
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
infected or not

1072
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,880
on the other side the malicious

1073
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,119
researcher will never be able

1074
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,320
to single out individuals from the

1075
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,640
heatmap

1076
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
and for the last part we needed this

1077
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,079
noise adding

1078
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,040
so and therefore we conducted a lot of

1079
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
privacy utility trade of experiments so

1080
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,480
that we could

1081
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,240
uh see which of how the range of the

1082
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,680
epsilon should be

1083
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
in this differential privacy to have the

1084
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,440
perfect privacy utility trade-off

1085
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
all the results i told you here you can

1086
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
find in the paper

1087
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,520
and there are more technical

1088
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,240
explanations

1089
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,640
for the security so security proof and

1090
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,480
performance measurements and also the

1091
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
details how we conducted

1092
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
the differential privacy experience two

1093
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
minutes remaining

1094
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,119
an additional thing that is in the paper

1095
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,000
is a multi-page

1096
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,560
analytical analysis of our protocol

1097
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,839
to break it down it says that

1098
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,760
because of the use of homomorphic

1099
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,880
encryption

1100
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
differential privacy and some other

1101
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,079
technical measure

1102
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,440
measures our protocol is gdpr compliant

1103
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,960
even though this protocol i

1104
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,400
presented you is for a specific use case

1105
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,040
the idea of our work is to convey the

1106
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,960
following message

1107
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,760
that even in times of crisis where it is

1108
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
tempting to

1109
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,040
maybe temporarily lower data protection

1110
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,119
standards for purposes

1111
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
of big data analytics there are

1112
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
technical methods to keep data

1113
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
protection standards high

1114
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
and those technical methods are

1115
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,119
practical

1116
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,920
and available right now thank you

1117
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,240
great thank you lucas um i

1118
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
see two questions in the chat before i

1119
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,240
go to the questions i'm going to ask

1120
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,560
um kevin to launch his polls so we all

1121
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,440
can kind of

1122
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
fill that out uh while we're going

1123
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,720
through the questions so kevin feel free

1124
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
to launch that when you wish

1125
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,400
i just have a one small announcement

1126
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,079
this is not really a

1127
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,400
scientific poll this is a heavy

1128
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,160
selection bias in this group but i'm a

1129
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,760
little curious if people have installed

1130
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,400
the apps

1131
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,079
go ahead

1132
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,119
you um okay i've got uh three questions

1133
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,720
for lucas i'll start with one from

1134
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
matias craft uh

1135
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
what is the time span for a single heat

1136
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
map rated at

1137
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,839
two hours or ten dollars in aws time

1138
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,359
the time frame yeah

1139
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
so if i understand it correctly maybe

1140
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,160
the time frame is so for

1141
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,839
how long the date we're looking at data

1142
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,520
for the last seven days

1143
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,960
last year so we have we have some

1144
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,040
uh but it doesn't really matter because

1145
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,079
we all these days gets

1146
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
summed up and then you have just an

1147
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,520
integer value in this matrix so from

1148
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
a performance reason it really doesn't

1149
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,560
matter if you have

1150
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,599
several days or one day

1151
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,640
excellent uh second question i see are

1152
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
there two variants of the protocol for

1153
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,359
semi-honest

1154
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,920
malicious adversaries and is there a

1155
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,040
performance hit if so

1156
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,280
so basically we could split them up we

1157
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,240
only

1158
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,040
now would recommend to use the militia

1159
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,160
the privacy

1160
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,880
against malicious adversaries and there

1161
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,520
is not much overhead because

1162
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,839
we could reduce this to a

1163
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,800
non-interactive proof system

1164
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
so there is not that much overhead from

1165
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,760
semi to malicious security

1166
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,160
okay great two more questions i see a

1167
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,680
one which homomorphic encryption

1168
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,720
realization did you use

1169
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,200
so we used microsoft's open source

1170
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,400
library seal for

1171
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,119
realization and used our own matrix

1172
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,160
vector multiplication algorithm for that

1173
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,920
great final question are there

1174
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,839
difficulties due to different sets of

1175
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,240
researchers and different mobile data

1176
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,119
providers

1177
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,839
all having separate databases

1178
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
so i have to say this wasn't rolled out

1179
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
so far this would be problems that would

1180
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
come up if we wrote it out

1181
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,760
excellent all right uh i think with that

1182
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,440
that concludes all that concludes all

1183
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,880
the questions that i currently see

1184
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,920
in zulu um and uh

1185
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,960
i now we're sharing out the poll results

1186
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,000
um from that instant poll uh 48

1187
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
of people apparently have installed a

1188
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,680
coveted tracing app or turned on

1189
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,359
exposure notification

1190
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,800
i want to thank you all for attending

1191
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,880
this session

1192
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,040
and obviously continue the conversation

1193
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
in zulu

1194
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,879
we're now going to go to break kevin
