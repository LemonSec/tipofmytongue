1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,520
good to go have a good session

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,040
okay welcome everybody to day two of

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,200
real world crypto 2021

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
uh good morning good afternoon good

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,639
evening

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,240
good night wherever you are around the

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,759
world i see we have

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,359
more than 200 people joining the session

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,359
welcome everybody my name is kenny

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,640
patterson and i have a very great

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,400
pleasure to be the session chair

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,840
to introduce luca defeo luca

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,400
is currently working for ibm in

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
switzerland so he's a neighbour

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,558
i suppose in a way and uh he's one of

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,760
the leading lights in the area of

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
isology-based cryptography which of

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,559
course all of you will know is one of

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,680
the

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,640
leading contenders for post-quantum

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
cryptographic solutions

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
and luca's talk today is entitled um

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,640
are isolated for real and uh luca i'd

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
very much like to invite you

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,399
to take over from here thank you thank

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
you very much for the introduction kenny

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,239
i'll start sharing my screen

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,480
can you see my screen

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,760
yes and so yeah i invited a friend

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
to give the talk for me so i hope you

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
i'll enjoy you'll enjoy and

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,240
um i'll see you at the end so we come

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
back for cuny at the end right

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
hi hertes welcome to real world crypto

35
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,720
1721 it is me pleasure

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,439
to give this talk entitled easy zodian

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,880
is for real

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
and i would like to take this occasion

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
to thank the organizers for inviting me

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,079
and for offering me crew a fine barrel

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
of wasting this round

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
so you all know that contemporary

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
cryptography lives and dies by the lt

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
curve

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
eliti curves give us all we could hope

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
for a hard discrete logarithm

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,719
problem reasonable speed compact

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,840
parameters

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
well understood side channel counter

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,680
measures and even pairings

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
but all good things must come to an end

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
and you only have heard of the manus

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
looming over eliti curves and discrete

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
logarithm in general

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,770
the quantum computer

56
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,959
[Music]

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
you have probably heard about nist post

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
quantum competition

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
and the various families of encryption

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
and signature schemes supposed to be

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
resistant to quantum attacks

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,319
in pole position we have lattices and

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
codes for encryption

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
multivariate polynomial systems and

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
lattices for signatures

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,920
but i'm here today to talk about another

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
family that's been making the bus

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
recently

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
no it's not the kardashians i'm talking

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,760
about

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
isogeny based cryptography when we talk

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
about post quantum misogyny schemes

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
we mainly talk about two distinct but

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,239
related families of schemes

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
and security assumptions to my left sidh

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
the key exchange and related schemes

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,720
based on the full super senior graph

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
to my right seaside yes

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,519
these things has to be pronounced

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,159
seaside the family of schemes based on

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,800
the action

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
of a quadratic imaginary ideal class

83
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
group on the subset of super singular

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,239
elliptic curves

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
defined over a prime field seaside is a

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
direct descendant of the very first

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,959
exogenous based schemes

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,640
the family of schemes based on the hard

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,519
homogeneous basis framework of culvenia

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,519
covanese work was not published at the

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,599
time and it's only 10 years later

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,280
that isogeny based cryptography really

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
took up first

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
charles goren and lauder introduced

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
super synerized arginine graphs in

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,680
cryptography

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
to construct collision resistant hash

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
functions

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
then rostov seven stone lunov

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,080
rediscovered cuven

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
scheme and were the first to suggest

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,000
that it may be quantum safe

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
the sidh key exchange only came some

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,519
years later

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
as a sort of mash-up of the ideas of

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
kuveng rostos and the slobunov on one

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,239
hand

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,000
and of charles gordon loader on the

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
other hand its importance

110
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
lies in being the first efficient

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
isogeny based key exchange scheme

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
and is currently the only exogeny-based

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
candidate in the third round of nist's

114
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
post-quantum competition

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
under the name of super-senior isogenic

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
key encapsulation

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
or psych since a few years the field of

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
hysogenic descriptor is booming

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,440
the recent discovery of seaside the

120
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,279
other efficient isogeny based key

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,320
exchange scheme

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,079
has been an amazing catalyst for the

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
development of the field

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
a considerable effort has gone into

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
designing efficient hysogenic-based

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
signatures

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
something that is only coming to

128
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
fruition now

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
let me stress now that sadh and seaside

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
give rise to two separate and

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
incomparable families of esogenic b

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
schemes

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
to take an example from the lattice word

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
they are as related as

135
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,759
ntrview and ringa labli and possibly

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,880
even less

137
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
each has its own strengths and

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
weaknesses which i am going to discuss

139
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,280
next

140
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
in the meantime to complicate things

141
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
several other interesting exogene

142
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
protocols have emerged

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
which are neither based on sadh nor on

144
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
seaside

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
i'll just mention here galbraith petit

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,199
and silva

147
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
seem to scheme and more importantly its

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
successor ski sign

149
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
which sets a record for combined

150
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,039
signature and public key size

151
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
in the arena of post quantum signatures

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
would you like to see yeah so let's

153
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,720
start from the beginning

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
what is anisogeny hysogen is our

155
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
morphisms of lytic curves

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
that is algebraic functions from a curve

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
to another curve

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
that preserve the group structure by

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,919
algebraic i mean that

160
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
isogenesis are defined by ratios of

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
polynomials the higher the degree of the

162
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,639
polynomials

163
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
the more complex somehow the exogenous

164
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
preserving the group low means exactly

165
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
what you would expect

166
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,759
exogene of a plus isog equals isogeny of

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,880
a plus b

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
so otherwise isogen and scalar

169
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
multiplication commute on the points of

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
the led curve we say that two curves are

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
anisogenous

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,280
if there exists an exogenous degree n

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
between them

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
misogynist are as fundamental to the

175
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
study of leading curves as matrices are

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,479
two vector species

177
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,240
they basically control all algebraic

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
properties of led curves

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
the group's structure their endomorphism

180
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
ring their pairings

181
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
because evidence the famous certain

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
theorem two elite curves are exogenous

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
over a finite field

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
if and only if they have the same number

185
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
of points

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
makes you wonder why no one told you

187
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
about them before

188
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
my view isogeny based crypto starts at

189
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
the moment you stop looking at the

190
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
single led curve and its esogenics

191
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
and enlarge your perspective to consider

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
all led curves with hydrogens between

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
them

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
this is what we call an esogenic graph

195
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,479
and in truth

196
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
there is more than one cryptographically

197
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
interesting way to construct them

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,000
indeed the first big difference between

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
seaside and sidh

200
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
is the kind of isogenic graph involved

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
but first we need to get something out

202
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
of the way

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
all led curves is really too much as

204
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,759
they contain too much redundant

205
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,039
information

206
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
instead we like to classify elliptic

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
curves by their isomorphism class

208
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
anatomical validity curve is just a

209
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
linear transformation

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
that maps points one to one and you may

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,319
know that the j environment classifies

212
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,199
elliptic groups

213
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
up to isomorphism usually in an isogenic

214
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,639
graph

215
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
vertices are j invariants representing

216
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
an isomorphism class of led curves

217
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,199
and edges are exogenous between the

218
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,960
curves up to composition with

219
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
isomorphisms

220
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
in a typical graph we also put some

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
constraints on the degree of the

222
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
esogenics

223
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
for example the esogenic graph using

224
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
sidh has four vertices all isomorphism

225
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
classes of super singular elliptic

226
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,880
curves

227
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
and for edges all exogenes of degree

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:44,240
either two or three

229
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
in seaside instead the vertices are

230
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
desomorphism classes of

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,759
super singularity curves defined over a

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,879
prime field with p

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
elements the restriction to the prime

234
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
field is important

235
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
the edges are all exogenous of degree

236
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,000
taken from a fixed list of small

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
prime numbers for example you can think

238
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,280
of all primes from

239
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
3 to 400 and something from now on i

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,599
shall call these two kinds of super

241
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,400
singular graphs

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
the sidh graph and the c side graph even

243
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
when they are used in situation

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
unrelated to both seaside

245
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
and sidh other names you will hear are

246
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
the full super senior graph

247
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
and the fp restricted super singular

248
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,479
graph

249
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
these two graphs pervade modernizogenic

250
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
base crypto

251
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
and underpin a number of different

252
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
security assumptions used to build

253
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
protocols

254
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
but before moving to these security

255
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
assumptions a word about non-super

256
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,039
singular graphs

257
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,958
why do isogenic photographers show so

258
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
little love for ordinary exogenous

259
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,599
graphs

260
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
if you come from classical cryptography

261
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
you may know that super singular led

262
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,479
curves are considered insecure

263
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,480
for ecc so why is it the other way

264
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
around for exogenesis

265
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
first the security of classical ecc is

266
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
clearly unrelated to that of

267
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
exogeny-based cryptography

268
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
second the original covalent rose of

269
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
systole boon of proposal

270
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,200
was in fact based on esogens of ordinary

271
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
curves

272
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
unfortunately isogenic computations

273
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
between ordinary curves are currently

274
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
too slow for cryptographic application

275
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
whereas super singular curves open the

276
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
way to a few crucial algorithmic tricks

277
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
that make all the efficiency of super

278
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
synerizogenic base crypto

279
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
arduino isogenic base crypto is not

280
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
impossible it's just that we are not

281
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
there yet

282
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
and we may never be so if the security

283
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
of exogenous is not based on the

284
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
discrete logarithm problem

285
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
what is it based on informally we say

286
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
that all these schemes are based on the

287
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
hardness of path finding in

288
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,959
exogenographs

289
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
but in reality there is a great variety

290
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
of different pathfinding problems

291
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
involved

292
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
the ideal pathfinding problem looks

293
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
something like this

294
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
even an isogenic graph of ability curves

295
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
over some finite field

296
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
fb given two random mesomorphism classes

297
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
of led curves in the graph

298
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
find a path in the isogenic graph

299
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
joining them

300
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
unfortunately only seaside and the

301
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
associated signature schemes

302
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
are based on the pure form of this

303
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
problem the esogenic graph in questions

304
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,480
being the seaside graph

305
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
of course we shall see however that

306
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,399
being based on a clean path finding

307
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:00,959
problem

308
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
does not make seaside immune to powerful

309
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
quantum attacks

310
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
sadh instead is based on a more

311
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
constrained problem in the full super

312
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,680
similar graph

313
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
indeed there the two curves are not

314
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,839
taken at random from the set of vertices

315
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
but at a rather short distance from one

316
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
another in the graph

317
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
about half the typical distance of two

318
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
random vertices

319
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,600
even more concerning both sidh and psych

320
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
need to publish

321
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
more information than just the start and

322
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
the arrival curve

323
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
together with these comes information on

324
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
how the secret isogeny acts on some

325
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
subsets

326
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
of points of the led curves something

327
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
that we call the

328
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,640
torsion point images we currently do not

329
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
know how to exploit this additional

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,519
information to break psych

331
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
but attacks exploiting the same kind of

332
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
information against hypothetical

333
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
variants of psych do

334
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,600
exist yet another problem is needed to

335
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
prove the security of the charge gore

336
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,959
and the loader hash function

337
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,040
here instead of looking for paths we

338
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,279
look for cycles in the esogenic graph

339
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
more precisely given a starting led

340
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
curve in the graph

341
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,680
collision resistance of the hash

342
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
function reduces to find in a cycle

343
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
passing through the curve

344
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
second pre-image resistance is similar

345
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
given an isogeny path

346
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
from some curve to some other curve find

347
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
an alternate path between the two

348
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
the alternate path problem is also

349
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
crucial for the security of some other

350
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
nompos quantum misogyny-based schemes

351
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,279
i shall mention them later

352
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
but so how hard is the pathfinding

353
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,320
problem

354
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,040
exactly how does one build key exchange

355
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
on top of it

356
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
to understand it we may build a graph

357
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
that relates to discrete logarithms in a

358
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,079
group

359
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
let's take analytic curve with group of

360
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
prime order q

361
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
and let's create a graph whose vertices

362
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
are all the points of the curve

363
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
except the point at infinity now we

364
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
connect two points a

365
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,279
and b with an edge whenever a is equal

366
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,360
to times b

367
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
we may do the same with a equals three

368
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,399
times b

369
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,959
a equals five times b etc

370
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,040
now given a generator g and another

371
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,079
point h

372
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
finding a path from g to h gives a

373
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,399
solution to the discrete logarithm of h

374
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,600
to base g

375
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
if the graph is well connected enough

376
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,760
shortest paths between points will be of

377
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,959
polynomial length

378
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
and we may thus say that the pathfinding

379
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
problem in this graph

380
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
is equivalent to the discrete logarithm

381
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
problem of the led curve

382
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,600
does this graph look familiar yes it has

383
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
exactly the same structure

384
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
as the c side graph so what do these

385
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
graphs have in common

386
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,120
mathematicians call these kali graphs or

387
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
more seldom schreier graphs

388
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,040
i shall prefer the second name because

389
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
it does better describe the seaside

390
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,519
graph

391
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,040
in this example we have two groups that

392
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
play the group of points of the elliptic

393
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,920
curve

394
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
and the group z mod q of the scalar

395
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
multipliers

396
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,079
we say that z mod q acts on the points

397
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,560
by scalar multiplication

398
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
but who is in play instead in the

399
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
seaside graph

400
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
the vertices are as we know isomorphism

401
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
classes are validity curves

402
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
definitely not a group you cannot add

403
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,279
two isomorphism classes of course

404
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
okay where is the group then a venerable

405
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
theory called the theory of complex

406
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,040
multiplication

407
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
tells us that a group is lurking behind

408
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
the seaside graph

409
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
it is not z-mod q it is not the group of

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,560
points of analytic curve

411
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
it is rather a class group of an

412
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
imaginary quadratic number field

413
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,200
okay now don't get scared you don't need

414
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,480
to know what an imaginary quadratic

415
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
number field is

416
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
or what a glass group is to use seaside

417
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
the important point is that we again

418
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
have what mathematicians call

419
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,360
a group action of a group the class

420
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,760
group

421
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
onto a set the set of isomorphism

422
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,480
classes or super singer curves

423
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
but given a group action how do we do

424
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
key exchange

425
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,519
it's very simple and it mimics classic

426
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
diffie-hellman

427
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,199
alice and bob each take random paths in

428
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
the schreier graph

429
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
they exchange the arrival vertices then

430
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
reapply the same random paths

431
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,519
starting from each other's vertex here

432
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,240
by the same

433
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,839
i mean the same element of the class

434
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,680
group that's acting on the super similar

435
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
set

436
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,639
the magic of group actions guarantees

437
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,720
that alice and bob secretly land on the

438
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
same vertex

439
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
which they can then use as shared secret

440
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,839
but is it quantum safe

441
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
confused huh if pathfinding is

442
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
equivalent to discrete logarithm

443
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,279
and if discrete logarithm is broken by

444
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
short quantum algorithm

445
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
why is seaside not broken too somehow

446
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,279
the strength of seaside comes from the

447
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
fact that the vertices of the graph do

448
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
not form a group

449
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
unlike the electrical points you can't

450
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
meaningfully add them together

451
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
this is sufficient to stop shor's

452
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
algorithm as far as we know

453
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
but the class group acting on the vertex

454
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
set is also the weakness

455
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
of seaside indeed if schwarz algorithm

456
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
does not apply a different quantum

457
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
algorithm due to cooperberg does apply

458
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,240
kuberper algorithm has sub-exponential

459
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,440
complexity in

460
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
exponential of square root of the size

461
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
of the group

462
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
it thus does not count as a total break

463
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,399
for seaside

464
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,920
it nevertheless causes quite some

465
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
headaches to cryptographers

466
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,959
when they try to quantify its quantum

467
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
security indeed you may have seen a

468
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
stream of papers in the last few

469
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
eurocrypt conferences

470
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
claiming wildly different security

471
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
levels for the same exact seaside

472
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,199
parameters

473
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
research on the exact quantum security

474
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
of seaside is still a very active area

475
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
and a consensus has yet to emerge

476
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,519
and this idh well you may have noticed

477
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,199
that the sidh graph looks quite

478
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,320
different

479
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,079
indeed for sadh there is no longer a

480
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
group action on the set of esomorphism

481
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,480
classes

482
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
of super singular curves in truth there

483
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,079
are lots of group actions by different

484
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,240
class groups on different subsets of the

485
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
vertex set

486
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
when they interact together these

487
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
different group actions get jumbled

488
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,959
together to an extent that is impervious

489
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,120
to kuperberg's algorithm

490
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,560
indeed the best known algorithm for

491
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,399
solving the pathfinding problem in the

492
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,360
sidh graph

493
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
has exponential complexity

494
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
but it's not only cryptobirth algorithm

495
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
that gets confused in the process

496
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
the diffie-element-like key exchange we

497
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
sketched previously also

498
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
breaks down completely to recover some

499
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
algebraic structure

500
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,279
and ensure the existence of commuting

501
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,959
paths for alice and bob

502
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
the groups of points of the elliptic

503
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
curves which were completely forgotten

504
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,279
in seaside

505
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,720
come to our rescue in sidh i am not

506
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
going to explain here how sadh

507
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,240
ensures that alice and bob's paths

508
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
commute there are excellent tutorials

509
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,120
for that

510
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,360
like super singer isogenic exchange for

511
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
beginners by cry costello

512
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
suffice to say that this trick does not

513
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
come for free as alice and bob

514
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
need now to exchange more information

515
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
which makes public keys slightly larger

516
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
and more importantly potentially paves

517
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
the way to specialized attacks

518
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
in conclusion no isogeny is perfect

519
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,880
sidh aka psych has better understood

520
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
quantum security

521
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
but is based on a somewhat adhoc

522
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
pathfinding problem

523
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
which is a bit concerning it is clearly

524
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,199
the more mature system

525
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
and a good fit for nist pos quantum

526
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,640
competition but has its flows and

527
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
limitations

528
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
seaside is at the same time older and

529
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,480
younger than sidh

530
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
older because of the original idea by

531
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,919
couvenia and younger because of the

532
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
recent move to supersenior isogenic

533
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,640
graphs

534
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,319
its quantum security is a complicated

535
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
matter to say the least

536
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,280
and it would probably be a bad match for

537
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
nist competition and it's not in the

538
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
next competition anyway

539
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
but seaside is also the only credible

540
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,039
instantiation of a post-quantum

541
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,120
cryptographic group action

542
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,880
no past quantum destruction comes as

543
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
close to all difficult as does

544
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,200
seaside and for this reason seaside is

545
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
capable of advanced protocols which are

546
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,919
nearly feasible

547
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,440
for lattices or codes etc most notably

548
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,960
seaside is the only efficient

549
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,520
post-quantum non-interactive case change

550
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
a fundamental component in

551
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
non-interactive protocols such as those

552
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
found in the signal messaging app

553
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,679
but since we mentioned codes and

554
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
lattices how do isogenic-based schemes

555
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,840
fair in comparison to other post-quantum

556
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,200
candidates

557
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
it is probably well known that key size

558
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
is the main marketing argument for

559
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,919
isogenes

560
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
psych has the smallest public keys in

561
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
ciphertext among

562
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
all news candidates in each category on

563
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,720
the other hand

564
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
psych is notoriously an order of

565
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
magnitude slower than other candidates

566
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,160
or into the large number of led curve

567
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,559
operations it needs to perform

568
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
this puts psych on the opposite of the

569
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
spectrum compared to code based schemes

570
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
which are very fast but have very large

571
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
keys

572
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,679
lattice-based schemes as usual come out

573
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,200
as the most versatile of all

574
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
post-quantum encryption schemes

575
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
seaside was originally instantiated with

576
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
even smaller keys than sidh

577
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,039
but progress in understanding

578
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,720
cooperblade's algorithm may bump these

579
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
sizes to levels similar to sidh

580
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
it is currently slightly possibly

581
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
unavoidably slower than sidh

582
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
and increasing his sizes can only widen

583
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
the gap

584
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
when we move to signatures the picture

585
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
becomes bleak sdh signatures involve

586
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,520
several hundreds of repetitions of sadh

587
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,240
they are thus

588
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,679
both slow and large seaside signatures

589
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
allow for some compromises in terms of

590
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,160
size

591
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
but are even terribly slower than lsidh

592
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
signatures

593
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
that is unless one is able to compute

594
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
the order of the class group

595
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
acting on the seaside graph this may

596
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,919
come a bit as a surprise

597
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,919
i told you that we know there is a class

598
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,120
group acting on the set of super

599
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
singular isomorphism classes

600
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
but i didn't tell you that this group is

601
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
more or less hard to compute

602
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,880
it turns out that computing its order is

603
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
doable in sub-exponential classical time

604
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
or polynomial quantum time more

605
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
crucially having done this

606
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
pre-computation

607
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
seaside signatures can be sped up by a

608
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
significant amount

609
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
producing a decent signature scheme

610
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,559
named seafish

611
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
the problem with this strategy is that

612
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
deep precomputation is very expensive

613
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
or even undoable for larger parameter

614
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
sets as long as we don't have quantum

615
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,960
computers

616
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
that is when we compare with nist

617
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,000
candidates

618
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,840
it looks like exogenebus signatures are

619
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
not an advantage

620
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
but there is hope we recently discovered

621
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
ski sign

622
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
a new kind of esogenic signature based

623
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
on these idh graphs but exploiting

624
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
completely different algorithms

625
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,919
ski-sign is currently quite slow for

626
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,159
signing but has acceptable verification

627
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,799
time

628
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,640
and remarkably small signatures and

629
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
public keys comparable in size to rsa

630
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
signatures

631
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,840
small keys small keys we got small keys

632
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,159
here

633
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
see nobody cares well yes

634
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
small keys are cool but do you really

635
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
need them

636
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
let's look at this cold here we are

637
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
talking public encryption

638
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
and signatures so the first application

639
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,720
that comes to mind

640
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
is tls now you may remember the ostrich

641
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,360
and the turkey experiment

642
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
run by cloudflare in google over the

643
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
course of three months

644
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
the two companies implemented in

645
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
google's chrome browser and in

646
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,200
cloudflare's

647
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
server infrastructure two tls extensions

648
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
featuring hybrid key agreements based on

649
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
anterior or psych

650
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
they measured the latency of the tls

651
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,559
handshake using each variant

652
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
and found out that the overhead of the

653
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,320
lattice-based scheme is barely

654
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
noticeable

655
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,000
whereas psych adds a considerable amount

656
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
of latency

657
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,120
but they also observed an inversion of

658
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
the trend in the right tail of the

659
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,000
distribution

660
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,919
where the slowest tls connections are

661
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
found they attributed this to sikes

662
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,600
smaller keys

663
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
which are more likely to fit in the

664
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
typical mtu

665
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,960
the maximum transmission unit of tcp

666
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
packets

667
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,919
and are thus less affected by packet

668
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,280
losses

669
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
this selection of psych as an art and a

670
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,360
candidate sends a clear signal

671
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,760
for the most typical use cases isogenics

672
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
are unlikely to be the preferred choice

673
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,280
too new and a tat too slow there is the

674
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
eggs in the basket argument of course

675
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,159
if lattices or coats prove to be broken

676
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
isogenous may save the day

677
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
and so far they've proven to be quite

678
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,559
sturdy against script analysis

679
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,400
but this decision is also an

680
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,159
acknowledgement that there may be

681
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
specific scenarios

682
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
where exogenes have the edge over other

683
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
candidates

684
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
so what would be a good use of sidh some

685
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
say small keys

686
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
are good for iot where small storage and

687
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,640
low bandwidth

688
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,600
are the norm but the high energy cost is

689
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
even more problematic there

690
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
and available ram is also an obstacle on

691
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,919
contemporary iot platforms

692
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,159
without dedicated hardware acceleration

693
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:16,960
i doubt

694
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
sadh could ever be used on low power

695
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
devices

696
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
other applications where speed is not

697
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
paramount but sizes

698
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
could benefit more from sidh for example

699
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,720
some fancy encrypted storage blockchains

700
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,600
come to mind

701
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,159
obviously however the main focus there

702
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,200
is on signatures

703
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
rather than encryption this is where ski

704
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,320
sign

705
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
could actually play a much bigger role

706
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,000
if we can gain confidence

707
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,679
in its security assumption in the coming

708
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
years

709
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,159
can seaside be a better choice than sdh

710
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
for any of these applications

711
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
i doubt it for one it seems lower than

712
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,000
sadh

713
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
and this appears to be an intrinsic

714
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
limitation of the algorithm

715
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
secondly uncertainty around its quantum

716
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:00,960
security

717
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,679
makes it not ready for production yet i

718
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,960
simply do not believe

719
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,039
that seaside will ever be preferable to

720
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,240
sidh for encryption or key exchange

721
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
even though it relies on a qualitatively

722
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,559
cleaner security assumption

723
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
so what is seaside good for if we speak

724
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,919
in terms of technology's readiness level

725
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,960
sidh is at level 6 whereas seaside

726
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
is only at level 2. so don't expect

727
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:26,960
seaside

728
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,600
in the real world in the next 10 years

729
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
but where seaside really shines

730
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
is in its flexibility sdh is a rather

731
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,360
rigid system

732
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
from which it is difficult to obtain

733
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,640
anything else than encryption

734
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,840
or key exchange codes well

735
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,960
we're still struggling to make

736
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
signatures with them although there's

737
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
recently been some interesting

738
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
developments

739
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,320
lattices are obviously very flexible but

740
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
terrible in practice at some tasks

741
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,080
for example threshold schemes seaside in

742
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,960
contrast

743
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,039
is the only known instantiation of a

744
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,360
quantum safe cryptographic group option

745
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,279
a cryptographic tool close enough to

746
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,400
discrete logarithms

747
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
that several classic protocols can be

748
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,919
easily translated to it

749
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
with essentially no knowledge of srgs

750
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
i already made the example of

751
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
non-interactive key exchange

752
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
a fundamental component of mainly

753
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
non-interactive protocols

754
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,559
such as optls or signal

755
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,640
but there is also oblivious transfer

756
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
oblivious pseudorandom functions

757
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,840
threshold signatures and many more i

758
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,039
invite you to read

759
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
cryptographic group actions and

760
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
applications by

761
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,679
alamati montgomery petranabis and myself

762
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
to learn more about seaside and

763
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,600
cryptographic group actions in general

764
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
in synthesis i believe that for the

765
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
moment seaside is only a cryptographer's

766
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,559
story

767
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,120
unfit for denise post quantum core but

768
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
keep an eye on it for amazing

769
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,600
applications

770
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
more advanced than just encryption or

771
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,080
signatures

772
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
finally i need to spend a few words on a

773
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
topic unrelated to post quantum

774
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,960
cryptography

775
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
remember those random walks in the

776
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
esogenic graph it turns out they have

777
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
another interesting feature

778
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
evaluating an exogenous chain is a

779
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
strictly sequential operation

780
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,159
isogeny walks used in post quantum

781
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,159
schemes are typically rather short

782
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,640
a couple of hundred of steps but what if

783
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
we take

784
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,919
much longer walks say thousands or

785
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,600
millions of steps

786
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,279
then we have an operation that takes

787
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,960
predictably long time

788
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,679
similar to repeated squaring in a group

789
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,279
combining this idea with classical

790
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,080
bearings

791
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
we obtain interesting time delay

792
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,279
primitives such as

793
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
verifiable delay functions time locked

794
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
puzzles

795
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
and a recently introduced one named

796
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,480
delay encryption

797
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,760
these primitives have several

798
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
applications in distributed protocols

799
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,799
randomness beacons leader elections

800
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,760
auctions

801
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,960
voting and are those very attractive for

802
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,159
guess what blockchains

803
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,760
now these primitives are quite

804
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,279
challenging to implement

805
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,120
but they wouldn't be surprised if along

806
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,279
with psych they were among the first to

807
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,760
be deployed in the real world

808
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,919
in summary exogenebus cryptography is a

809
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,200
very rich field

810
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
with a variety of different assumptions

811
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,400
and constructions

812
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
which can hardly be summarized in a

813
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
single talk

814
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
some of these such as psych are already

815
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,039
road tested

816
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,440
and essentially ready for production

817
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,080
others

818
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
require more research but may prove to

819
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,600
be invaluable to some advanced

820
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,880
applications

821
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
i hope that this quick overview gave you

822
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,960
a fair idea of what isogenics can offer

823
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
and will motivate you to learn more

824
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
about them well

825
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
the media knows this stuff i always says

826
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
a pirate worth its salt must know some

827
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,080
good old-fashioned

828
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,919
misogyny say hello and see you at the

829
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:53,120
next pirate conference

830
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
thank you very much luca that was a

831
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,880
fantastically entertaining but also very

832
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,840
illuminating talk

833
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
i personally really enjoyed it very much

834
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
uh we go now to

835
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,080
the chat room to see if there are any

836
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,520
questions for you

837
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
uh it seems like you've been answering

838
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,559
some of them during the talk which is a

839
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,200
wonderful

840
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,039
um feature of actually giving your talk

841
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,960
as a video

842
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
so there is a question from uh taco

843
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,159
boris

844
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,600
watts asking uh when you're talking

845
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
about signatures you mentioned sidh

846
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
which signature scheme do you refer to

847
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,559
um so yeah i call them sidh signatures

848
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,600
for clarity i guess the scheme is

849
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,399
typically

850
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,879
called the

851
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
it's a paper published in 2017

852
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,880
it's based on the zero knowledge

853
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,039
protocol that's

854
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,360
that's already in the original sidh

855
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
paper

856
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
and it's just the theatrical transform

857
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
of that

858
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
so that's what i call this idhc interest

859
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,799
like the

860
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,679
the first signature we ever knew from

861
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,480
misogynist

862
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,200
to be true thank you and there's also a

863
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,039
question from james muir asking

864
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
what software libraries should people

865
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
know about if they want to play around

866
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,159
with isoldes

867
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,080
um it's um depends what kind of play

868
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,799
around

869
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,960
you mean if you want to play around with

870
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
the mathematics like

871
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
to learn more about the general theory

872
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
of exogenous and

873
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,919
like constructing hydrogen graphs

874
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,679
playing with them

875
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,080
i would more recommend computer algebra

876
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,720
software

877
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
and of course sage and magma are the two

878
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,760
foremost

879
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
unfortunately see just some features

880
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
which magma does not have and vice versa

881
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,240
so

882
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
you need to juggle with the two and

883
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
magma is not free

884
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
but yeah these are definitely the two

885
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
most recommended ones

886
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
if you want to play around with

887
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
implementing these schemes

888
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
in practice for cryptographic schemes um

889
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,520
i would recommend of course

890
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,399
flint and gmp are the usual starting

891
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,360
libraries for finite field arithmetic

892
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,080
and then on top of that you can pretty

893
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,720
easily

894
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,120
implement this idh or c side by looking

895
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
at the papers

896
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
then there's some research packets that

897
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,399
have been published like

898
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
there's quite a few research packets you

899
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
can find on github

900
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,159
but then that's um that's not what i

901
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,520
call libraries is more than just

902
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,039
research code

903
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,600
okay so those are all the questions from

904
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,279
the chat that i can see maybe i can ask

905
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,399
a final question

906
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,080
are you surprised in this decision not

907
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,000
to include sidh amongst the

908
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,679
top group of finalists but only to hold

909
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,360
it in reserve

910
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,120
um no i'm surprised by this decision to

911
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
call some finalists it doesn't

912
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,000
look very um uh i would say

913
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,120
um uh uh

914
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,919
precautions um maybe it's a bit too

915
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,320
early to standardize already uh

916
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,799
these schemes um i think it would have

917
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
been definitely too premature to

918
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,000
standardize psych now

919
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,399
so i'm happy with uh with site being an

920
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,640
alternate candidate

921
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,559
and i understand that there may be some

922
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,840
push to get some

923
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,960
early candidates which we can use and

924
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,360
then i'm not surprised that mcleese and

925
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,399
lattices are

926
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,320
the the preferred choice we definitely

927
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,679
know these teams much better than

928
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,640
isogen-based schemes

929
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,720
great thank you very much um so

930
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
unfortunately we're out of time for this

931
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,760
session i think i could um i could

932
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,120
listen to you all day talking about

933
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,640
isolation-based cryptography

934
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
so let's offer a look a virtual round of

935
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,039
applause

936
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,640
and um i'll then hand over to

937
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,480
dan bonnay who's going to share the next

938
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,880
session
