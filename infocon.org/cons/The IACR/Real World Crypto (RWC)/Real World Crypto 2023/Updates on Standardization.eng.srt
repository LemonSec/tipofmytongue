1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
organization is is fun

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,100
so so this is going to be fun

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
hi everyone

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,860
all right so

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,680
um give a few people a few seconds to uh

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,199
settle down and the lights to come down

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,699
low

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,380
and uh all right so please welcome

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,160
stanislav

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,520
hi everyone my name is Dennis love and

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,320
my talk is about the current walk of

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,800
cfrg which we are sharing together with

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,620
Nick Sullivan and Alexa melnikov

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,540
so

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,840
um so Refugee goals are described in the

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,559
charter and the most important one is

17
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,620
about serving as a bridge between server

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,199
and practice providing good cryptography

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,860
to the item and taking all the best from

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,300
the Academia

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,840
broadly speaking our goals in

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,560
iitf and iftf Community are educating

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,979
iitf participants how to use and how to

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,740
build and security protocols with good

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,460
crypto provide cryptographic expertise

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,060
for iitf working groups and defy North

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,340
standardize existing crypto Primitives

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,259
for usage by iitf or other fdos

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,380
I have some history we have had some

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,180
changes of chairs and we've had two

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,900
selections one for elliptic curves and

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,259
one reason for pack

33
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,119
protocols both of them were quite

34
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
interesting and I will try to give a

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,299
hint about

36
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,740
the results a bit later

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,079
we published many documents some of them

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,939
are really white known and widely used

39
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,320
including elliptic curve documents

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,500
including some pod Quantum mechanisms

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,080
and some recommendations for security

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
usage of Randomness in security

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,840
protocols which is quite important for

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
everyone

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,060
but I'll try to focus on our current

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,280
work and our future work

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,620
uh so first of all we have a tight

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,540
connection with the iitf community

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,739
because most of our output directly fits

50
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,560
into iitf work most of all it's about

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,940
security area working groups and all of

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,480
our mechanisms are inclined involved

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,940
into the process of other working groups

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,280
and we develop their more standard size

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
existing based on requirements from as

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,940
working groups for example such words

57
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,959
like the operf hpk Apex are the things

58
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,319
that we develop for usage in the iitf

59
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,900
protocols

60
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,739
sometimes you have some specific

61
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,980
requests like

62
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,720
how much some key can be used in such

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,620
mode or how to use it or with elliptic

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,440
curve or pack should we use somewhere so

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,500
we try our best to give our

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
recommendations there

67
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,099
we have established a crypto review

68
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,680
panel it's a set of experts selected

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,140
experts who provide some security

70
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,000
expertise based on existing security

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,760
assessment of mechanisms

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,459
provide us Security reviews and provide

73
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,280
security reviews for working groups that

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,580
need them moreover as they are deeply

75
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,040
involved into the process of selecting

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,739
something like packs currently we have

77
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,659
11 members but

78
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,799
our area of expertise should be even

79
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,640
wider so we need experts at least in

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,940
multiparty computations and if you are

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,280
ready to volunteer please let us know

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,860
and we'll be happy to consider including

83
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,019
you in the panel because we have a lot

84
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,519
of important and difficult documents to

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,760
make in the future

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,220
we have also quite a tight connection

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,680
with Academia

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,840
all of our model mechanisms have

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,960
undergone a very deep security analysis

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,400
even if you just search safer G in a day

91
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
print you'll find a lot of security

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,139
papers dedicated to the mechanisms that

93
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,139
were developed or sanitized inside

94
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,639
several G like pegs hpkey usage limits a

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,600
demote Etc and every time when some new

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,540
item is proposed we require the also to

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,400
present the results about security

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,160
assessment and when is a document is

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,500
developed inside separency your security

100
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,740
results are always presented as Effigy

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,020
meetings

102
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,900
uh and when we have crypto European

103
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,160
expertise uh going on they always assess

104
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
the current state of security proof

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,080
security assessment of all mechanisms

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,120
there is a pain point an obvious pain

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,699
point that we are not as quick as

108
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,259
someone may want because cryptography is

109
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,380
hard and we try to assess mechanisms as

110
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,860
good as we

111
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,840
can so we try to have enough opinions uh

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,580
some deep research so some things could

113
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,500
be recommended from our group a little

114
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,620
slower than maybe

115
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,100
would be happy for the ITF

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,720
now we have some differences and

117
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,360
similarities between cfrg and other sdos

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,060
an example of iso working group 2 of

119
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,720
subcommittee 27 I would like to

120
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,360
underline some of them so I would say

121
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,240
that one of the most important audience

122
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,880
for ISO drafts ISO standard sorry

123
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,580
is a regulatory bodies seeking for

124
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,820
guidance for their areas some industry

125
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,680
specific bodies that seek for mechanisms

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,860
that are standardized all over the world

127
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,740
and the most important audience for us

128
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,060
for safer G are the protocol designers

129
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,340
who try to choose the best possible

130
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,860
mechanisms for the protocols for example

131
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,240
TLS and implementers of that crypto now

132
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,460
who want to make it as secure as

133
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,560
possible in the end implementations

134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,919
because all of us want their crypto to

135
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,500
be properly implemented including all

136
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,620
stuff with prng

137
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,740
Etc

138
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,940
we have

139
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,100
we don't have any strict requirements

140
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,740
about maturity of mechanisms and like

141
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,919
ISO you can bring something new to this

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,139
FRG if it is

143
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,620
well studied if it is if it has some

144
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,099
deep research and we'll be happy to

145
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,300
discuss it and we don't need you to be

146
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,699
sanitized for three years or more on the

147
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,080
national level like in ISO and

148
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,740
um

149
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,240
is the main focus of our documents is uh

150
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,080
absence of any ambiguity so the

151
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,819
documents must be ready for implementers

152
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,819
to do everything right

153
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,319
and of course we have one main

154
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,220
similarity with any other sdo

155
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,960
making use of

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Samsung with security all make a news

157
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,979
must be thoroughly assessed and the

158
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,340
security proofs must be reviewed by at

159
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,900
least someone

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,860
uh we have a lot of plans we have an

161
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,319
a set of upcoming documents all

162
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,599
documents on these slides the slide has

163
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,139
already

164
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,539
[Music]

165
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,919
and so some and now they are as a later

166
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,580
stages of publication so we hope to have

167
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,779
all of them this year uh to Primitives

168
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,299
uh one pack which was not selected in

169
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,159
the back selection process but was still

170
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
needed by uh some working groups uh to

171
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,820
specific signature schemes or save line

172
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,600
signature which was mentioned yesterday

173
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,660
for example threshold signatures and two

174
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,600
protocols via ref and the operfs again

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,740
which was mentioned yesterday

176
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,899
in one of the presentations

177
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,200
and we have some medium term work a lot

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,519
of documents to be made I have four

179
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,839
documents

180
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,860
under heavy assessment and in the active

181
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,860
phase of work with primitive modes of

182
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,899
parameters for example parent family

183
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,140
curves which is needed by everyone in in

184
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,600
iitf in several G so we really need this

185
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,260
document to be done uh

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,200
post Quantum mechanisms two

187
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,180
um short signature schemes based on

188
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,160
parents that's why we need verified

189
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,080
Liquors and two packs which are the

190
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,899
finalists the winners of our black

191
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,019
contest Juan opaque which was again

192
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,519
mentioned yesterday is an augmented pack

193
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,240
and the CPS which is a balanced pack

194
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,640
and the last slide uh

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,100
two important privacy preserving

196
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,399
protocols documents uh key blinding

197
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,920
which is more or less ready to be

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
published now as I think and vdfs we

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,740
have two important drafts about

200
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,800
recommendations of usage a of aeds one

201
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,100
of them is about a d limits so how much

202
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,720
data we should encrypt with your

203
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,320
favorite AED mode and about the overall

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,680
properties of AED algorithms so if you

205
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,380
don't know what is kick meeting AED or

206
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,000
something you should refer to this

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,959
document

208
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,560
and to drafts which is indicated are

209
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,540
indicated to making the implementation

210
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,940
of crypto even more secure using some

211
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,839
determinization or some including some

212
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,899
additional Randomness in the process and

213
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,959
we hope to finish them this year or the

214
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,060
next year

215
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,040
if you want to know more you can visit

216
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,300
our wiki page and you can always send us

217
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,200
an email using this address

218
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,140
and we have a meeting on Friday it is as

219
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,959
always it is the same time as the IDF

220
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,620
meeting so I will be will be in Yokohama

221
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,160
about one hour and a half with the train

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,980
so please feel free to come and just

223
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,200
register to the meeting of IDF meeting

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,500
and we always have a lot of work to do

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,740
and a lot of documents to review and we

226
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,980
also we always need new experts thank

227
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,540
you very much

228
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,360
[Applause]

229
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,060
all right thanks stanislav any questions

230
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,700
if not

231
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,480
um

232
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,019
let's see give people a second yes no

233
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,620
okay uh well thanks again and let's

234
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,780
invite the next speaker up

235
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,399
[Applause]

236
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,300
Louis burn down Louise hello um let's uh

237
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,180
Luis is here to talk about nist uh

238
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,380
specifically

239
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,140
multi-party threshold schemes which is

240
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,459
something that a lot of folks in this

241
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,079
room are interested in so uh please

242
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,820
welcome Louise

243
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,560
[Applause]

244
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,779
hello everyone a pleasure to be here uh

245
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,459
thank you Nick and the organizers for

246
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,320
inviting thank you everyone for sticking

247
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,959
around uh till the last talk

248
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,360
um I'm a magnetist as a contractor from

249
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,940
certifia and I'm here to talk about

250
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,600
um

251
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,100
a call on threshold schemes

252
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,540
uh let me start with a little bit of an

253
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,660
intro about some nist uh projects so uh

254
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,579
everyone here will know about pqc for

255
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,079
example that has been driven the process

256
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,639
for standardization of post Quantum

257
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,980
signatures and key encapsulation most of

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,060
you probably also know about the

259
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,279
lightweight crypto project which has

260
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,579
been driving the process to uh figure

261
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,700
out uh how to standardize some new uh

262
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,560
Primitives for authenticated encryption

263
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,200
with Associated data and hashing and

264
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
these two projects have been having a

265
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,920
standardization perspective a little bit

266
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,720
in contrast we have other projects such

267
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
as the Privacy enhancing crypto which we

268
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,139
can call

269
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,380
um to have a more exploratory nature it

270
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,420
looks uh particularly the Privacy

271
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,060
enhancing crypto project looks at

272
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,260
Primitives with some Advanced features

273
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,700
and functionality such as for example

274
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,040
morphic encryption NPC zero knowledge

275
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,019
proofs and then we have the multi-party

276
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,480
threshold crypto project that is has a

277
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,279
focus on how to implement diverse

278
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,779
cryptographic Primitives when the key

279
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,220
Secrets shared and that's what we call a

280
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,480
threshold scheme of course there are

281
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,700
very other projects in the nist crypto

282
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,200
group but here I want to make this

283
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,180
contrast between direct standardization

284
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,760
approach and a more exploratory nature

285
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,459
uh the topic of today's talk here is the

286
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,680
threshold call for short which is an

287
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,240
output of the pack and the multi-party

288
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,579
threshold crypto projects and in short

289
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,279
the goal of this call is to start a

290
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,019
process to gather reference material for

291
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,899
public analysis which aims at least in a

292
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,579
first phase to issue recommendations

293
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,320
these recommendations can be of a

294
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
technical nature like best practices and

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,000
other things like that it can also be a

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,040
recommendations in terms of processes

297
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,800
that will ensue in the future

298
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
the organizers also has to to give a few

299
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
updates on on this standardization so

300
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,459
before delving into the call let me just

301
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,700
mention in terms of pqc there's a name

302
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,920
to have draft standards on the selected

303
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,620
schemes by the summer of 2023 and

304
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,300
there's also a Current public call for

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,279
more post Quantum signatures the

306
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,920
submission deadline is in June 1st

307
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,800
there's Ray and Dustin here to whom you

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,320
can ask questions if you have any during

309
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,880
this Workshop there's also the

310
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,199
lightweight crypto project that in

311
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,959
February as selected ascon as a set of

312
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,139
as a candidate so it was the selected

313
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,720
candidate for uh to be from which to

314
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,760
standardize some authenticated

315
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,260
encryption with Associated data and

316
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,540
possibly hashing as well for constrained

317
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,699
environments there will be a workshop to

318
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,339
discuss that in June 21st and 22nd you

319
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,899
can submit by May 1st if you want to

320
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,940
present there and ref standards are

321
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,220
aimed for late 2023. as I already

322
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,260
mentioned the threshold call uh is is

323
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,480
already in a draft mode uh comments are

324
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,279
due in April 10th one of the the main

325
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,899
message I want to leave in this talk is

326
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,000
that please submit comments if you are

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
interested in this topic because they

328
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
can affect the final version of the call

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,120
and we aim to have a call finalized by

330
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,160
the end of 2023 and the submissions

331
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,639
deadline will be set hopefully uh around

332
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,579
the first semester of 2024. just a few

333
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,320
extra notes a nist currently has a

334
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
cryptographic public a publication

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
review board that has aim to review all

336
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,040
standards that are older than five years

337
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
review can mean just basically live as

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,180
is if they're still good or possibly

339
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,459
make technical changes or editorial

340
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,519
changes as another example we have fips

341
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,019
186-5 which was just published in in

342
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,459
February it's kind of the final version

343
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,800
of the standard net that specifies

344
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,139
various signatures including at the

345
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,760
essay and if you have curiosity about

346
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,800
other projects you can check online

347
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,380
okay so let's focus on the threshold

348
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,540
call for the rest of the presentation so

349
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,940
this is basically a call that is calling

350
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,560
for threshold schemes for diverse

351
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,300
Primitives and the call is organized in

352
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,880
two main categories the first one is for

353
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,279
selected standardized Primitives where

354
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,260
we have The Usual Suspects of signatures

355
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,019
public key encryption uh some Primitives

356
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,000
for key exchange also some block ciphers

357
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,060
and then perhaps more interestingly uh

358
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,100
mainly in terms of having a much wider

359
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,139
scope we are also interested in

360
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,820
threshold schemes for Primitives that

361
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,980
have that are that belong to schemes not

362
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,500
standardized by nist here we have a

363
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,699
particular interest in threshold

364
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,380
friendliness basically meaning you know

365
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,399
schemes that can actually be

366
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,560
thresholdized and possibly with Advanced

367
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,180
features as I already mentioned like

368
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,880
philiomorphic encryption for example ibe

369
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
identity based encryption I had not

370
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,139
mentioned it yet zero knowledge proofs

371
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,480
Etc okay let me show you a little bit in

372
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,180
more detail uh some of the scope of the

373
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,579
of this category so for category one as

374
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,140
I mentioned there are various types of

375
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,119
Primitives you organize them in five

376
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,699
subcategories signing public encryption

377
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,640
pairwise key agreement

378
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,559
symmetric Primitives like block ciphers

379
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,319
and hashes in terms of how they're using

380
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,839
their use for key derivation and key

381
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,119
generation as an example in the case of

382
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,740
signing you would have three families of

383
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,079
specifications from which to choose in

384
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
terms of submitting a threshold scheme

385
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,179
like at the essay cdsa and RSA and then

386
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,100
for because we are in category one we

387
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,780
already have the nist references from

388
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,120
where where the confessional schemes are

389
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,740
specified for example for public

390
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,260
encryption the obvious candidate

391
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,880
primitive would be RSA decryption

392
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
because that's where we have a secret

393
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,780
key but actually it also makes sense to

394
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,100
have a threshold scheme for RSA

395
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,120
encryption if we're talking about

396
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,120
encrypting a secret value I want to go

397
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,679
through all the table but just wanted to

398
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,059
leave it here and you can of course

399
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,820
consult the the actual document a little

400
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,960
more interested in talking about

401
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,380
category two so we have within it a

402
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,179
subcategory mapping each of the previous

403
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,580
subcategories in category one so again

404
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,100
signing PPE key agreement symmetric

405
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,559
Primitives in key generation but here

406
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,000
we're looking at Primitives not

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,919
standardized by this so for example if

408
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,140
we focus a little bit on signing things

409
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,059
that would be in scope would be let's

410
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,679
say in the second line a threshold

411
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,900
friendly Quantum resistance signature so

412
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,620
it has a a somewhat of an overlapping

413
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,260
um scope with the pqc project but here

414
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,000
we're looking to for to the actual

415
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,220
threshold schemes uh that would

416
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
thresholdize this Quantum resistance

417
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,760
signatures we can also consider

418
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
signatures that are not Quantum

419
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,539
resistant but that would have features

420
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,360
not present in in this standard so for

421
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,679
example threshold signature that would

422
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,600
be succinct and verify verifiably

423
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,520
deterministic and even if they're not

424
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,440
Quantum resistant you could still set a

425
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,120
good reference for what we might want

426
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,299
later on as Quantum resistant features

427
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:57,960
um

428
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
some interesting components here on

429
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,120
subcategories that are not Beyond those

430
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,720
first five so uh one on it's a category

431
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,419
on Primitives with Advanced features so

432
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,559
for example here we are actually

433
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,200
interested in receiving submissions for

434
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,179
threshold friendly Quantum resistant

435
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,700
philiomorphic encryption uh we're also

436
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,140
interested in hearing about threshold

437
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,580
schemes for identity based and

438
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,440
attributes based encryption of course

439
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
because these Primitives are not

440
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,620
specified in this standards a submission

441
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,900
also needs to specify the conventional

442
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,539
scheme a special category a subcategory

443
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,000
is on zero knowledge proofs of knowledge

444
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,720
this one is interesting uh in in two

445
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,299
ways one is that uh we accept

446
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,100
submissions for conventional zero

447
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,120
knowledge proofs they don't need to be

448
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,740
thresholdized as long as they are

449
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,440
motivated in terms of helping

450
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,539
um other threshold schemes or somehow

451
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,000
relate to The Primitives in other

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,020
subcategories but of course we're also

453
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,419
interested in threshold versions of it I

454
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,880
think for example of a secret uh secret

455
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,620
that is secret shared across across

456
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,240
parties and then now all the parties

457
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,620
want to get together and collaborate to

458
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,520
produce

459
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
as your knowledge proof about something

460
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,640
about that key let's say that the public

461
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,679
key is correct for example

462
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
we also have a subcategory for gadgets

463
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,400
which basically means building blocks

464
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,919
that can be helpful across a number of

465
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,900
the other threshold schemes here is an

466
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
example garbled circuit but there are

467
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,500
many others including commitment schemes

468
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,220
oblivious transfer etc etc

469
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,340
um it's a big table you can consult it

470
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,400
later on as well uh now I really want to

471
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,840
take the opportunity here to mention

472
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,400
what is the kind of interaction that

473
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,780
we're looking for to have from the

474
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,240
community in particular because the only

475
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,860
way that this project can go move

476
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,080
forward successfully is with interaction

477
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,179
from the community so we have three

478
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,799
particular phases one of them is about

479
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,020
feedback and the first opportunity for

480
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,780
feedback is within two weeks and just as

481
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,000
a few examples we welcome comments about

482
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,620
the structure and the scope of the call

483
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,360
for example you can let us know if it

484
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,580
makes sense for some some Primitives to

485
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,160
be in scope or are there any missing or

486
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,220
something along those lines it would be

487
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,340
interesting to hear about your ideas on

488
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,200
compatibility or incompatibility between

489
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,900
Quantum resistance thresholdness and

490
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,120
other Advanced features and of course

491
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,799
you're also welcome to make a number of

492
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,000
technical comments on security

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,559
properties that we should be looking at

494
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
questionnaire recommendations and other

495
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,520
suggested requirements that we could

496
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,620
possibly add or remove from the call

497
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,140
then eventually we will have a second

498
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,460
phase for concrete submissions

499
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,320
submissions are specific fighting the

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,260
call you know they have a structure in

501
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,280
particular they have a structured

502
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,860
specification with a number of sections

503
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,140
including security analysis the

504
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,520
submission requires an open source

505
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,380
implementation evaluation

506
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,620
Etc and then we'll ensue a third phase

507
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,539
of public scrutiny of submitted schemes

508
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,000
where you know a bid that you submitted

509
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,100
or not submit we will welcome evaluation

510
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,020
comments from the community and of

511
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,059
course this as well as in the in the

512
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,220
previous phases can of course impact the

513
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,200
subsequent recommendations that we're

514
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,940
looking for

515
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,919
some assorted notes about the threshold

516
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,380
call uh really assorted

517
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,140
um in terms of submission focuses

518
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,020
um a submission can have can cover a

519
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,179
family of threshold schemes so you can

520
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,760
submit actually something

521
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
that covers various subcategories uh one

522
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
particular aspect on Securities that

523
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
we're looking for active security so

524
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
we're explicitly not interested in

525
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,860
schemes that are only passively secure

526
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,500
if you think otherwise also feel free to

527
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,299
submit comments about this in terms of

528
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,340
synergies we welcome very much

529
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,740
submissions of schemes that might be

530
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,480
under development in other

531
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,919
standardization bodies or being

532
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,100
developed by Community efforts again the

533
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,780
aspect of reference material is that

534
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,760
this is not a competition it's important

535
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,260
to emphasize that it's not a competition

536
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,919
with the aim of selecting a winner after

537
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,780
a first period of analysis but of course

538
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,360
the fact that some schemes are submitted

539
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,600
will create a good public exposure and

540
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,400
can of course influence future processes

541
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,440
and in terms of of clarification

542
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,500
we're really expecting that the process

543
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,539
overall will actually clarify a number

544
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,340
of interesting aspects about system

545
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,500
models what is what are the right

546
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,059
security formulations that we should be

547
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,400
looking at for threshold schemes Etc I

548
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
have this kind of written out as well

549
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,380
but I'll leave that for offline review

550
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,760
uh just want to emphasize again public

551
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,220
feedback within two weeks by April 10th

552
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,120
this will help improve uh the final call

553
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,919
um there's this is last slide just to

554
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,720
mention there are a number of online

555
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,780
resources so of course the the

556
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,640
publication is online public comments

557
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,500
should be sent by email

558
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,080
and you have the websites of the two

559
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,780
projects including forums in particular

560
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,820
the form has not been very active namely

561
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,400
if we compare it with other projects but

562
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,159
we hope that once this period of public

563
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,000
feedback uh ends and we publish the the

564
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,559
all the comments that we received we

565
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,840
really hope that this will lead to some

566
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
constructive and healthy discussion

567
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,980
online

568
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,299
um thank you very much for your

569
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,280
attention and I'll be glad to answer

570
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,639
questions

571
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,640
all right anybody brave enough to ask a

572
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,299
question before the end of the day

573
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,740
if not another thanks for Luis and

574
