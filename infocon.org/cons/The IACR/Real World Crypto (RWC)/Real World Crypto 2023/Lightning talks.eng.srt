1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Happy World Cup we're going to form a

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,440
line out so stroke scrum down here

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,780
and we want to hear all your lovely uh

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,139
uh adverts for jobs

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,120
um cool ideas

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,119
problems for everybody or whatever

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,760
as we said the length of time you have

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,039
to speak is a proportional to the length

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
of the queue there's interesting gaming

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
ways you can screw people over by fake

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,840
people joining the queue to make

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
someone's talk go shorter

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,579
or all sorts of games

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,260
no because that's why I said everyone

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,239
outside but have you you've had advanced

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,340
warning I'm not changing the rules after

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,980
through the game right so

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,959
and we're off up we come

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,820
I stood there really I'm first that was

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,039
not my intention

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
um I'd like to talk to you about Rosen

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,739
pass

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,319
um I brought some media

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,700
person pass

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
it's post Quantum VPN solution with the

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,680
Standalone implementation that sends its

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,600
keys to wireguard in the kernel it

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
provides hybrid security

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,979
um by sending the keys to wireguard in

30
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,080
the kernel and it the data fronts part

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,640
is still handled by wireguard itself

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,939
which makes it very efficient

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,400
and use three cam key exchanges

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
encapsulate decapsulate and no

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,900
signatures to provide authenticity and

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,180
forward security secrecy

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,100
and it's all free and open source

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,380
software

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,140
there is a symbolic model

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,700
um and a symbolic model is part of the

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,439
open source repository so we kind of

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,619
treat it as part of the software itself

43
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,200
and it produces red and green output

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,280
check mark for it worked and this Green

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,560
Cross and red for it didn't work so I

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,820
think that is the main result of our

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,799
work actually nice looking symbolic

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,680
verification output

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
and um if you're looking to try out

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,759
something like this please head to

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,500
rosenpass.eu

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,479
and follow the quick start guide to see

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,760
how it works and we are looking for

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,739
collaborations if you're doing any High

55
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,440
Assurance cryptography stuff we'd like

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,819
to hear from you because we'd like to

57
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,319
try out if it works as part of Frozen

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,780
pass and if it is good enough we'd like

59
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,180
to deploy it in the real world and if I

60
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,220
may I have two more things to announce

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,440
foreign

62
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,250
[Applause]

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,459
and off hello I'm from ptq so after the

64
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,980
next biggest in the direction what is

65
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,400
the next step we need to migrate and to

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,099
use the post content critical fee here's

67
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,959
a lot of research you discuss about it

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,080
so there is another scenario that we are

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,900
thinking about is that when you need to

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,599
store a bunch of the signatures and the

71
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,959
storage code is very expensive uh we

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,540
have the the solution for that oh yes we

73
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,340
can use the real knowledge proving

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,040
system to generate the equivalent proof

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,920
and compress the the size of the the

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
signature for the the needs the standard

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,879
so our construction can achieve 12 times

78
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,500
smaller in terms of the size of the

79
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,239
proof yeah

80
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,560
uh in the case of 2000 yeah a single

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,680
interest and but there is no free launch

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,379
what we need to pay for these benefits

83
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,599
okay so the proven time is very long it

84
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,540
takes around 30 minutes

85
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,819
that's why we need Hardware right and

86
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,140
over to the next one

87
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,440
foreign

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,580
ERS of the Poseidon hash function

89
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,280
and I'm really proud it's used in dozens

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,440
of applications I'm a little bit less

91
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,700
proud that all these usages are insecure

92
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,799
we have I'm an auditor I take money for

93
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,939
finding out that they're insecure

94
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,160
they're indeed insecure it's very bad so

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
what we have done in response after

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,358
earning all this money

97
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,940
we've suggested so-called safe API it's

98
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,580
the thing that you can use sponge hash

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,040
functions in a very very secure way much

100
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,660
much more secure that people have done

101
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,040
this before in particular in the zero

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,440
knowledge and blockchain space so safe

103
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,900
API use it everywhere just Google for it

104
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,580
it's a very nice thing as a side effect

105
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,860
we have designed Simple Rules how to do

106
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,940
your fair chamir for your

107
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,380
non-interactive protocols

108
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,580
again Rugby World Cup so I need to kind

109
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,199
of work out how to tackle them in a

110
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,360
rugby fashion but there we go

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
hi we're from a semiconductor company

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,259
called Cranium Labs we think that

113
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,060
off-the-shelf microcontrollers and

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,580
secure elements do not support uh

115
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,040
cryptographic Innovation well you have

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
for example credit card secure elements

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,199
that are optimized for a fixed set of

118
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,380
decades-old function uh at the lowest

119
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,880
possible cost then you have general

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
purpose microcontrollers like what's in

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
this microphone uh very flexible and

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
useful but they have not even

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,160
rudimentary physical security and both

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,020
use floating gate memory which is

125
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,419
inherently fragile and examinable so

126
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,580
we're making a new type of secure MCU

127
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,800
that is designed from the ground up as a

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,960
platform for cryptographic Innovation

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,960
some of the Novelties dance process node

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
for better cost power size function uh

131
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
resistive non-volatile memory which is

132
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,220
what enables the advanced node in the

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,600
first place but it's great for security

134
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,940
because it's inherently uh not

135
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,160
examinable uh it's it's robust against

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
environment and aging we have monolithic

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,080
integration of the the CPU memories

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,479
cryptographic accelerators all under a

139
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,680
common umbrella of physical

140
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,139
countermeasures we have direct Hardware

141
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,120
support for Leading Edge cryptography

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
while maintaining flexibility because of

143
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,820
the co-located CPU runs off arm or risk

144
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,500
uh we're open sourcing everything

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,780
providing an fpga board we'll have

146
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,580
samples at the end of the year come see

147
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,080
us to talk about uh jobs or applications

148
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
oh

149
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,340
the next then and we're converting to

150
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,840
the next speaker

151
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,780
uh okay so I just wanted to tell you

152
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,180
about we have a nice uh cryptographic

153
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,860
primitive we're calling it a ring vrf so

154
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
ring Signet it's a ring signature and a

155
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,419
verifiable random function

156
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,340
um the URL if you want to read about it

157
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,060
on ePrint is 2023-2

158
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,500
um the uh it um okay there these things

159
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,479
are very useful for identity if you read

160
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,220
Brian Ford's personhood papers you

161
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,139
should have an idea how that works much

162
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,240
much safer than any kind of attribute

163
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,600
based credential uh you usage for

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,639
identity and you can also use them to

165
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,919
play uh cards against you Cards Against

166
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,520
Humanity

167
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,919
yeah I just wanted to say a few words

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,479
about the project that I work for which

169
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,240
is web3 auth so we basically have the

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,060
goal of making Key Management uh easy

171
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,479
and secure for everybody

172
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,039
uh the technology runs on threshold

173
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,660
cryptography

174
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,240
um at scale actually we have uh actual

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,199
real world users now we manage about I

176
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,539
think 10 million Keys we have 200 000

177
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,660
daily logins so there's a yeah quite a

178
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,220
few interesting research problems for

179
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,039
running these kind of threshold

180
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,120
protocols at scale and if you're

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
interested I can tell you more

182
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
okay

183
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
and far away

184
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,819
hello I just want to announce a very

185
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,280
informal dinner tomorrow

186
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,940
um

187
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,759
for all security Auditors or however you

188
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,780
want to call yourself Security

189
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,300
Consultants cryptography reviewers

190
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,220
there's a lot of names for that

191
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,960
um if you want to come to the very like

192
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,720
informal and very spontaneous or just do

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,099
not let me know I'm going to Tweet about

194
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,020
it as well and we did something similar

195
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,840
last year for lunch so if you've been

196
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,699
there last year I'm happy to see you

197
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,819
again tomorrow night

198
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,740
cool

199
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,539
here we go

200
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,199
hello uh we're defense DF and S uh

201
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,059
crypto custody and wallet service

202
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,580
provider uh we're leveraging NPC and

203
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,799
threshold signing protocols uh to manage

204
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,240
our keys

205
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,039
um we have a lot of interesting projects

206
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,559
including MPC uh threshold cryptography

207
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,760
post Quantum open sourcing Etc et cetera

208
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,220
we are hiring uh part-time uh full-time

209
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,620
intern positions for cryptographers

210
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,800
crypto cryptographic engineerings uh if

211
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,540
you're really interested come talk to us

212
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,519
and to our team members thank you

213
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,080
I couldn't recommend them more

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,580
sorry

215
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,920
hi I was pushed up here by my co-authors

216
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,459
to advertise a paper we presented at FSC

217
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,480
last week

218
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
in that paper we present the first

219
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,720
cryptanalysis and break a cipher called

220
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,839
half loop 24. it's based off as and it's

221
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,680
a 24-bit block Cipher it's it's

222
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,120
interesting because it's sexually

223
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,600
specified in a U.S military standard in

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
as late as 2017. and is used for

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,580
confidentiality and authentication in

226
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,740
high frequency radio automatic link

227
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,140
establishment we present a bunch of

228
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,959
attacks with low complexities

229
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
Unfortunately they can't be used in

230
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
practice because it requires slightly

231
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,060
more data than can this are

232
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,459
realistically collected but we still

233
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,660
think it's sort of you know it's

234
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,000
interesting if you're interested to read

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,580
more there's there's task issue 3 2022.

236
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,580
cool so some people are acting on a

237
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,140
denial of service attack on the speakers

238
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,360
by making the queue longer so the time

239
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,339
is now going lower it's going to be

240
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:09,720
faster now

241
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,060
all right I've always wanted to make a

242
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,399
puzzle Adventure game and so I finally

243
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
reached my 30s and I had more stability

244
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
and I made a puzzle adventure game

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,060
my back hurts because I'm carrying so

246
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,700
many copies of my puzzle adventure game

247
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,399
it's a very good game okay I bought 100

248
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,740
copies the Customs the Tokyo Customs

249
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,779
they made a big deal out of it why do

250
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,279
you have a suitcase full of puzzle

251
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,160
Adventure game okay it's a very nice

252
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,839
game you can get it for free it's

253
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,240
written and go oh wow very exciting new

254
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,740
technology

255
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,920
um it works on Windows Mac Linux and

256
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,300
also there's a Nintendo switch version

257
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,860
but Nintendo doesn't let me give the

258
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,560
copy away for free come get a copy of my

259
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,240
puzzle Adventure game it has an original

260
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,700
soundtrack many interesting over four

261
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,800
interesting characters over 100 Levels

262
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
just come take a copy because I need the

263
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,640
luggage space to get gifts back

264
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,300
thank you

265
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,880
hi I'm muthu we have a brand new way to

266
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,240
schedule group meetings

267
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,120
just Google meshkal you can try it free

268
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,279
today you can schedule with any number

269
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,040
of people like no back and forth emails

270
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
no you know when is meet manual stuff

271
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,980
just go to our go to meshkal Google

272
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,380
meshkal and try it now why am I

273
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,180
announcing it at real world crypto and

274
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,279
not Rugby World crypto

275
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,519
well because we use cryptography and we

276
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,920
use secure multi-party computation as as

277
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,420
you must and they didn't stop me at

278
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,640
immigration because my stuff is free

279
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,579
it's available online please try it

280
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,380
thank you

281
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,420
okay go

282
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,940
hi I'm Conrad and if you want to build a

283
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,440
shiny new public key authenticated

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
encryption protocol from a Nike and an

285
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,760
AE then I've got something for you if

286
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,079
that is the case I'd like to draw your

287
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,440
attention to a paper by Francis

288
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,240
and myself where we proved just such a

289
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,980
construction secure generically the

290
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,839
proof is machine checked by using

291
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,820
easycrypt in a kind of interesting set

292
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,120
separating way and we instantiated using

293
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,980
the cryptobox Primitive from the knackle

294
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,560
or assault Library so if you find that

295
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
interesting just Google cryptobox

296
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,800
security proof or come talk to me or one

297
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,839
of my co-authors thanks

298
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,320
cool

299
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,420
and the next person try at our Rugby

300
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,320
World um crypto thingy is Nicole to vary

301
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
from the network and information

302
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,040
security group at Tampa University in

303
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,660
Finland this is just a short

304
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,060
advertisement so we do a lot of things

305
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,940
in our group but I'm here to talk about

306
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,560
the fact that we are involved in a

307
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,360
project for integrating diverse software

308
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,620
and Hardware implementations of

309
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,779
post-quantum cryptography algorithms in

310
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,380
openssl and Mozilla and SS via loadable

311
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,440
modules to ultimately reach unmodified

312
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,260
real world applications so we have PhD

313
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,899
input stock positions to fill so if you

314
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,600
are interested please reach out either

315
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
to me here or via email at

316
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,560
nikola.tubidy at Tunisia

317
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,279
cool

318
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,279
this means you can have a longer amount

319
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,720
of time if you've got more people on

320
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,180
stage great I don't think we'll need it

321
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,240
hi I'm Matilda together with akshaya

322
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
Chelsea and Sylvia I would just like to

323
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
announce that tomorrow over lunch there

324
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,940
will be a meet-up for women and gender

325
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,459
minorities so if you identify as any of

326

tomorrow yeah tomorrow yeah yeah

335
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,459
and they'd like to stress that's

336
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,540
definitely tomorrow yeah

337
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,760
I work at lurk lab we are developing

338
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,839
lurk language for snarks and it is based

339
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,220
on group 16 and Nova as backend and it's

340
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,500
also implementing both sidom but it's

341
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,040
not unsafe because our CTO is also a

342
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,700
co-author of safe API and well that's

343
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,839
true and uh we have IVC and we plan to

344
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,300
support Supernova in the end of this

345
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,579
year which means that we have not only a

346
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,220
universal circuit but we will have flat

347
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,500
circuits which we call co-processors

348
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,779
please check out on GitHub our

349
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,040
implementation

350
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,260
and that's it thanks

351
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,760
[Applause]

352
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,940
cheating there we go hello good morning

353
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,360
uh so due to the lack of monitor we we

354
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,579
had big plans for this lightning talk

355
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,459
but we'll have to tone it down to

356
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,079
other plants so

357
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,959
hey Georgia how much are 25 MSM over G2

358
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,579
in BLS 12.

359
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,880
so okay so 25

360
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,000
MSM of 25 in G1 so one filled

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,800
multiplication in G1 is 100

362
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,540
nanoseconds

363
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,639
how much is 38 pairings

364
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,820
okay a pairing is 0.6 milliseconds and

365
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,899
then if you have 38 that's like 18

366
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,860
milliseconds but then if you can

367
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,620
amortize the you can use Z calc for

368
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,000
these uh

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
[Laughter]

370
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,139
the curve and the operation calculator

371
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:56,240
so I can open it up and write 28 here

372
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,779
and tap enter and it tells me it is uh

373
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,880
an MSM on G1 is 58 9 mil microseconds

374
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,399
and it's very easy to use and it has

375
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,380
graphs and then a whole page about

376
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,720
methodology and how we are able to

377
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
estimate data for a different set of

378
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,779
Curves on different Platforms in

379
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,800
different libraries thank you

380
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,899
and I was gonna say you've got two

381
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,040
minutes but no you haven't because

382
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,420
there's just some other people join the

383
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,579
queue so no

384
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,519
hello nerds uh I'm from the dran team at

385
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,100
protocol Labs uh we run a threshold

386
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,800
network uh since three years in

387
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,060
production along with the league of

388
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,279
entropy uh some of my colleagues are

389
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,600
presenting a paper on time lock

390
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,920
encryption tomorrow so you should

391
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,199
definitely attend that talk and on

392
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,399
Thursday we're running a Randomness

393
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,560
Summit in the media Hall just at the

394
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,360
back there and there are about 20 subs

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,940
left so find us on Twitter and sign up

396
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,560
please

397
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,160
cool

398

and close

399
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,880
hi everyone I'm Clarice CEO of Defense

400
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,859
but also board member of the MPC

401
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,260
Alliance

402
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,160
Alliance were completely industry

403
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,260
agnostic we cover use cases that are

404
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,720
both on privacy and security side this

405
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,040
year is going to be very exciting

406
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,540
because we're going to hire an executive

407
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,199
director so try to really put some big

408
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,859
initiatives and help the industry

409
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,140
worldwide we are studying working on

410
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,880
standardization effort on the digital

411
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,679
asset security space so if you want to

412
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,600
contribute come and join the MPC

413
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,840
Alliance thank you

414
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,700
whoa whoa

415
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,580
Clarice wins the best dressed

416
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,350
[Laughter]

417
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,260
hey hello everybody so as you may know I

418
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
heard it was customary in cryptography

419
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,760
research to vote about Thing by

420
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,220
whistling I heard that's oh AES got

421
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,400
elected as the AES you know and we were

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,679
discussing yesterday with Filippo and

423
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,380
strad and Jan about whether or not we

424
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,860
should be doing a BLS uh you know the BL

425
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,320
signature and how it requires like BLS

426
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,440
dedicated curves and it has not very it

427
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,600
doesn't has a standard yet or whatsoever

428
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,760
and so would it be interesting to if

429
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,240
like a draft or a proper standard for it

430
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,760
so if you think it's interesting whistle

431
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,100
and maybe we will remember that later

432
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,260
and if you think it's not useful just

433
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,980
don't do anything

434
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
okay thank you I think that answers the

435
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,539
question

436
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,620
that's not

437
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,600
okay off you go

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
hello this is Fatima from WPI

439
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,000
um multi-party computation and garble

440
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,299
circuits have been around for decades I

441
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,280
would like to brought your attention to

442
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,980
cycle analysis of these constructions if

443
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,140
you are interested let Goblin take a

444
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,780
look at your library uh please take a

445
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,780
look at our publication at a

446
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,340
ePrint archive uh 2023 slash one is

447
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,080
where you can find Goblin thank you

448
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,720
okay next one

449
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,700
hello yeah sorry we hacked the queue a

450
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,080
little bit

451
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,380
um so we are queer we are having a lunch

452
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,299
meeting in like 15 minutes I'm not sure

453
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,220
what time it is exactly but a quarter

454
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,720
past 12

455
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,400
on the floor number 4f room number four

456
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,100
feel free to join us if you like

457
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,170
um yes be queer take over the world

458
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,299
[Applause]

459
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,919
yeah I don't yeah I don't want people to

460
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,780
trip over and like break their legs and

461
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,400
things that's that's for the real Rugby

462
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,740
World Cup okay okay next one

463
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
uh Hey everybody my name is William I

464
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,460
run the open source team at trail of

465
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,900
vets and this is just a brief

466
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,120
announcement so uh we're doing a lot of

467
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
work with the six door project which is

468
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,500
uh just to summarize it it's like the uh

469
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,559
let's encrypt for code signing and so uh

470
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
this project is not particularly novel

471
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,320
in terms of the cryptography it uses but

472
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,940
it is a novel in terms of the breadth

473
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,039
that we're trying to uh accomplish in

474
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,240
terms of getting code signing out to

475
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,580
everybody and so uh that's the kind of

476
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,539
thing that interests you we have a lot

477
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,039
of sort of Novel issues to tackle around

478
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,380
like proving identity and uh doing

479
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,460
things without using blockchain

480
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,140
hopefully so if you want to talk about

481
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,059
those things uh I'll be around but let's

482
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,980
talk so thank you

483
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,640
cool

484
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,660
Martin looks really excited about coming

485
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,760
up on stage here

486
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm mostly here to express my

487
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
disappointment in all of you people

488
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,440
there's a rule to these sessions you

489
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,600
need to announce that you're hiring not

490
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,380
even Nigel kind of friend up here

491
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm hiring so like somebody has to do it

492
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,980
hi I'm Martin I'm a King's College

493
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,799
London I like cryptography I'm hiring so

494
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,419
I have a bunch of postdoc positions

495

coming up and can also talk about other

496
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,200
positions so

497
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
come on people okay

everyone knows this right all every year

501
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,640
cosic wherever I'm employed we're always

502
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,520
hiring you know that's the joke for the

503
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
last 15 years and it will always be the

504
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,940
joke there we go

505
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,160
so hi I'm one of my doll's students at

506
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,640
Gothic

507
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,380
yeah so um recently we developed the

508
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,720
first auram scheme to be a stateless and

509
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,980
non-interactive

510
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,980
for the client so basically it allows uh

511
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,620
Oram to run on a mobile phone for the

512
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,460
client

513
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,580
but this is not real world yet so we're

514
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,320
interested in having a conversation with

515
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,580
anyone who's

516
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,039
like interested in building uh cloud

517
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,280
storage that's privacy friendly so we're

518
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,140
trying to find new use cases or ways to

519
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,640
optimize our protocol so we'd love to

520
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,380
have a discussion uh the paper is called

521
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,960
Panacea it's in on it's on April thank

522
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,200
you cool

523
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,460
thank you hello and up to you thank you

524
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,620
my name is Eli soul from NCCA group I'd

525
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,640
like to take a moment to tell you about

526
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,020
a Learning Resource that I'm working on

527
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,179
called the crypto Pals guided tour now

528
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,100
crypto Pals needs no introduction it's

529
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,780
an outstanding problem set many people

530
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,100
have completed it learned a lot from it

531
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,260
many more uh have gotten stuck and given

532
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,780
up and uh sort of the goal of this is

533
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,179
not to be a walk through it's not to

534
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,380
replace working through the problems

535
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,360
that is meant to be a companion piece

536
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,640
that can help you learn more from them

537
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
each video uh this is you can find them

538
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,059
on YouTube crypto Pals got a trh video

539
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,940
is uh starts with a discussion of the

540
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
attack in theory and then we move on to

541
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,000
implementing it in practice with

542
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
discussion of every step we have

543
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,460
beautiful animation starting with set

544
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,600
two

545
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,039
um and this is Matt is Learning Resource

546
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,600
so it's only useful if we put it in

547
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,679
front of the people that could actually

548
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,120
learn from it so if you find this

549
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,159
interesting then please check it out

550
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,539
um if you know anyone who would find

551
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,620
this interesting then please consider

552
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,140
forwarding it to them and uh yeah that's

553
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,400

run crypto hack and I need your help

559
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,179
with postcodes and crypto challenges and

560

loads of people helped and gave me loads

561
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,340

changing nappies

578
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,980
[Music]

579
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,799
hi everyone I am Erica I work at eff but

580
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm talking uh on behalf of isrg right

581
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,059
now which is that if you saw Sophia's

582
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,620
talk earlier and you said wow that was

583
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,360
some really cool crypto she made but

584
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,679
what if we could just like throw money

585
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,200
at this problem to make it easier isrg

586
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,580
which is the organization that runs

587
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,380
let's encrypt has a service called Divi

588
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,120
up which does privacy preserving metrics

589
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,280
currently it's yeah very great really

590
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,500
cool crypto great to see a non-colluding

591
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,720
server very exciting but currently you

592
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,700
have to pay to use it so if you want

593
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,440
small organizations to be able to use it

594
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,820
that would be great and be great for

595
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,440
cryptography everywhere and let us all

596
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,900
do more secure stuff everywhere

597
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,460
if you have a lot of money and you want

598
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,960
to throw it at this problem to fund

599
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,340
other companies to be able to have

600
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,799
security let me know and I will get you

601
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,940
hooked up with the people who accept

602
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,080
that money at isrg

603
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,679
okay so um loads of those people have

604
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,900
spoken gave you URLs people to contact

605
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,120
Etc if they want to actually post on

606
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,559
Twitter using real world crypto not RWC

607
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
because apparently there's something

608
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,799
else which does The Clash on the

609
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,020
initials then please do so any other job

610
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,880
adverts just post them on Twitter at

611
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,799
real world crypto having talked about

612
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,760
Twitter

613
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,440
um actually I think there's a lot of

614
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,600
people who are not here who appreciate

615
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,179
one person's work in this room Deirdre

616
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,200
does a lot of work

617
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,440
on the live Twitter feed

618
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,500
so let's give her a round of applause

619
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,860
okay and lunch

620
