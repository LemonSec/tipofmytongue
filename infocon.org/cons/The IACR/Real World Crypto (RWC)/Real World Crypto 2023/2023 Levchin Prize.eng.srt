1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
morning uh let me see here if I can yeah

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,779
very good very good

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,980
okay so we're off to a wonderful start

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,019
with a super interesting morning thank

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,580
you thanks to all the speakers for all

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,440
the wonderful talks and now we're gonna

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,719
do the fun part of the morning which is

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,539
a love chin prize ceremony so just to

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,520
remind everyone the love chin prize is a

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,840
prize that actually honors major

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,699
Innovations in cryptography that have

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,220
had significant real world impact it's

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,560
the only prize that kind of focuses on

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,420
sort of real world impacts on in

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,180
cryptography so it's a uh I don't know

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,059
it's a unique prize in that sense and so

17
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,739
I guess the prize just to let you know a

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,760
little bit about the history of the

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
prize the prize was started in 2016.

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,140
it's named after Max levchin maybe

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,180
you've heard of him he's the founder of

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,940
PayPal and a firm in a very very

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,320
long-term supporter of Applied

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,660
cryptography when we reached out to Max

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,820
to say we want to create an award in

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,680
applied cryptography we want the award

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,719
to be an award of ten thousand dollars

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,420
he immediately said uh yes uh you know

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,760
support it forever and you know that'll

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
be the award we had to work a little bit

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,840
harder to convince him to name the award

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,180
uh that we would name the award left in

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
prize but it's such a cool name that uh

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,860
the name stuck and so that's uh that's

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,479
what it's called Uh yeah so he

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,680
immediately agreed he'll will support

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,360
the award for interpreportivity it's

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,759
quite a quite a a significant commitment

39
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,920
on his part so we're very grateful that

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,159
he is not willing to do all that okay so

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,140
the award uh itself has been awarded as

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,960
I said from 2016. I I wrote I listed

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,520
some of the winners or actually all the

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,619
winners uh of this award up until now

45
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,200
it's a very prestigious list these are

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
folks and organizations who really have

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,700
had transformative transformative impact

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,920
on real world cryptography

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,479
so it's wonderful that we can recognize

50
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,780
this work and award them uh the prize

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,540
the prize itself actually the trophy uh

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,640
for the prize is this fancy cryptex it's

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,799
really heavy actually if you hold it in

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,960
your hand it's a pretty massive uh

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,060
cryptex and in order to get the prize

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,680
you have to open the you have to set you

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
have to figure out the key and get the

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,579
cryptex to open we used to put the prize

59
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,259
in the cryptex so you couldn't get it

60
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,580
unless you actually figured out how to

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,720
open the cryptex

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,940
well we don't do that anymore

63
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,840
turned out too hard

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,860
yeah what the trophy looks like it's a

65
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,140
very very uh very beautiful and uh

66
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,379
impressive trophy and so with that uh

67
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,200
let's uh let's award the two winners of

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,599
the 2023 Lufkin prize for real world

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
cryptography all right so our first

70
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,440
winner for 2023 is uh Vincent Raymond

71
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,300
Raymond

72
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:46,409
[Applause]

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,420
do you say a few words and so Vincent

74
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,720
the the citation is for co-designing the

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
advanced encryption standard AES so the

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,300
initial proposal for AES was called the

77
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,000
reindale cipher back in 1998 uh

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,660
submitted to nist in 2001 nist actually

79
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,640
chose rhindale as the winner of the

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,140
competition and it became the officially

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,300
became the advanced encryption standard

82
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,420
AES is probably the most profound uh

83
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,940
real world result in cryptography I

84
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,159
think uh like a substantial fraction of

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,379
all of Humanity's Computing resources is

86
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,659
now devoted to compute Computing AES so

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,459
it's quite a remarkable uh remarkable

88
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,900
Cipher how it's like literally

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,140
universally uh used everywhere but uh

90
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,120
Vincent did a lot more than just AES I

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,500
wanted to mention that he also designed

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,420
lots of other block ciphers lots of

93
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,459
other hash functions and has also done

94
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,620
quite a lot of work in uh symmetric

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,440
cryptography as well so with that please

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
join me in recognizing uh Vincent for

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,879
his amazing work and please come on

98
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,820
stage

99
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:58,090
[Applause]

100
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,760
another movie and yeah it is

101
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,700
okay

102
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,900
thank you

103
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,659
um this price means a lot to me a lot to

104
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,799
me

105
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,079
there's of course the money involved

106
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,760
there is the nice trophy that will lay

107
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,040
down papers on my desk

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,500
and maybe most importantly I get five

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,419
minutes of your time and you have to

110
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,500
listen to whatever I say

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,220
um

112
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,680
already as a young boy I was actually

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
always strongly interested in

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
mathematics

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,300
however

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,960
currently I'm often reminded of a quote

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
by a famous security researcher Ross

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
Anderson

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,380
who said that in any freshly opened

120
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,620
research area you have about 10 years

121
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,960
before theoretical mathematicians move

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,780
in and take over

123
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,630
and then it's time to leave

124
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,080
[Music]

125
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,280
um

126
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,800
you can think of theory of cryptography

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,560
practice of cryptography real world

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,080
cryptography I think this is developed

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,860
Edition so you could get scared a bit

130
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,479
um however

131
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,180
I think actually cryptography is one of

132
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,120
the few research areas where we don't

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,699
have to be afraid of mathematics

134
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,500
because

135
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,919
in fact many mathematicians who thought

136
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,840
they were studying quite esoteric

137
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,259
Concepts purely curiosity driven

138
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,539
found themselves suddenly

139
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,240
the cells and their pet topics at the

140
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,699
center of interest of large companies

141
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,960
and other organizations doing

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,460
cryptography

143
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,520
and also to stay a bit close to myself I

144
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,780
think that one of the reasons why

145
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,419
Randall was selected to become the AES

146
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,580
was because of its mathematical elegance

147
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,180
and beauty

148
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,100
of course it remains a fact that

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,440
in many research areas also in ours

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
there is a tendency that there are

151
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
results published that

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
you could call a Pity of the Silicon

153
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,020
that is used to store them

154
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,300
and sometimes it is indeed because the

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,940
results are maybe theoretically deep but

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,400
not about real world problems

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,220
but I think actually more often

158
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,960
the problem is that the results are not

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,000
significant also not for non-real

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,400
problems

161
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,580
and this I think is due because of a

162
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,020
continuous pressure

163
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,319
to publish often and shallow

164
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,720
which is caused by the

165
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,860
continuous strategization of our world

166
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,900
you want to go to a conference you need

167
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,539
one publication you want a PhD you need

168
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,120
to do Publications you want funding for

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
a project you need five Publications

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
and I think that's something where we

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,419
should work on also as a community

172
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,180
and then about the Divide between

173
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,220
academic research and

174
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,460
deployment of crypto in practice I think

175
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,100
the sort is double etched on the one

176
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,319
hand there is the Ivory Tower

177
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,300
where some accommodations

178
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,880
lock up themselves but on the other hand

179
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,039
there is also what I would call

180
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,699
the swamp of dirty practices

181
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm sure all of you have evaluated

182
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
commercial products I have encountered

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,240
your share of weak outdated

184
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,400
incomplete wrongly implemented or

185
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,160
Homebrew cryptography

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,979
so I accept this price as a motivation

187
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,960
for me to continue working for

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
development of real cryptography world

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,770
thank you

190
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:59,220
[Applause]

191
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,580
well said okay so uh we have one more

192
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,220
winner as I said when we asked uh when

193
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,340
we created the prize we said initially

194
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,599
that there would always be two winners

195
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,099
every year and so I'm very happy to

196
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,259
announce actually their second winner of

197
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,340
2023 and so the second award this year

198
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,890
goes to all culture in the citation

199
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,500
[Applause]

200
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
say a few words

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,580
so citation is for pioneering work on

202
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,679
slide Channel analysis so Paul actually

203
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,080
virtually created uh the field of side

204
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,179
Channel analysis I wanted to list some

205
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,458
of the highlights uh so I guess in 1996

206
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,380
you already published the first paper in

207
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,300
the area which talked about timing

208
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,519
time-based attacks and showed all the

209
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,860
the um uh the attacks that are possible

210
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,899
simply by measuring the time that a

211
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,300
crypto system takes to run and amazingly

212
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,740
that already is enough to leak the

213
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,019
secret key in many many uh many cases or

214
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,940
leak other information you quickly

215
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,560
followed up by with differential power

216
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
analysis which is again a much more

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,820
powerful technique for extracting keys

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,220
from protecting environments and this is

219
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,720
of course he's explored he's done a lot

220
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,399
of work on both of these areas and

221
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,620
others I wanted to mention uh the recent

222
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,480
work a more recent work that he did on

223
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,060
Specter which is basically uh exploiting

224
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,220
or studying the security implications of

225
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,200
speculative execution again it was a

226
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,940
large team but you notice that Paul is

227
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,860
actually the first the first author uh

228
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,140
so amazing amazing set of works and

229
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,779
again have had tremendous impact on the

230
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,640
industry before I head into you Paul I

231
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
wanted to also remind people that this

232
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,540
is not the only thing that Paul did he

233
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,060
also was response he also was one of the

234
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,580
main authors of a little known protocol

235
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,320
called SSL 3.0 uh yes which literally

236
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,019
for 20 years or so protected almost all

237
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,420
communication on the planet so uh yeah

238
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,279
it's amazing amazing impact on the

239
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
practice of cryptography in the real

240
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,380
world so with that uh uh please join me

241
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,760
in congratulating Paul for winning the

242
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,060
award

243
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,340
where's yours

244
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,779
[Applause]

245
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,760
thank you Dan and I want to just thank

246
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
the prize committee for choosing us

247
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,399
there's so much great work out there

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
that I feel kind of embarrassed and

249
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,399
humbled to be standing and speaking to

250
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,540
you here

251
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,180
um and I was trying to think about kind

252
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,519
of what to say and I wasn't sure what to

253
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,720
say and I'm still not all together sure

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
what I should say but what I felt was

255
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,339
really clear which was gratitude for the

256
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,740
security and crypto communities

257
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,940
um and I'm going to start with just a

258
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,260
little quick story about how I ended up

259
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,880
in this world so I was an undergraduate

260
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,260
at Stanford

261
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,120
um grew up in Rural Oregon my plan was

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,100
to be a veterinarian I was studying

263
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,800
biology and but I've been always

264
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,079
interested in other things and kind of

265
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,519
being able to learn about areas that I

266
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,260
wasn't you know kind of interesting

267
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,000
self-taught in computers a little bit of

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,740
math and I wrote Marty Hellman saying

269
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,060
hey I'm interested in this thing about

270
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,820
cryptography and after talking with one

271
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,260
of his grad students he welcomed me into

272
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,600
this world of people who were thinking

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
about cryptography and its impact in the

274
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,079
real world

275
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,660
um and you know if it weren't for them I

276
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,980
would be a veterinarian right now and

277
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,600
depending on how much you like animals

278
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
and how many headaches you've had from

279
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,240
side Channel attacks you can decide

280
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
whether that's a good thing or a bad

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,660
thing but uh I'm here and I'm not

282
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,980
working in a vet clinic right now and

283
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm super super enjoyed being a part of

284
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,180
this world

285
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,620
um and I want to point out that wouldn't

286
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,320
have happened in most fields in most

287
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,240
places there would have been barriers to

288
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
people coming in there would have been

289
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,800
ideas that were too opaque to understand

290
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,680
um you know the part of this is an

291
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,839
accident in history where we had double

292
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,000
e and computer science and math all kind

293
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
of coming together so a sort of a

294
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
wayward veterinarian didn't really seem

295
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
as different as maybe would have been in

296
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,440
some other places but that's only a

297
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,060
little bit of it the real big part of it

298
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,680
is that we had a group of people in this

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,380
world who were inviting and are inviting

300
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,240
and made it a place where I've really

301
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,260
enjoyed

302
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,540
um enjoyed working and having some you

303
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,579
know fun with folks some of the folks

304
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:00,959
I've had fun with I want to shout out to

305
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,420
one is the cryptography research rambus

306
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,980
team that I worked with for many years

307
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,140
and also the people who entrusted us

308
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,779
with real world problems because kind of

309
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,060
the Grist for real world research is

310
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,980
understanding what customers need or why

311
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,600
systems are failing

312
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,579
um and I'm somebody who loves the real

313
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,200
world stuff I think Vincent called it

314
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,959
the the swamp of dirty practices

315
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,100
um so I'm not sure what that says about

316
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,560
me but I really really love those kinds

317
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,180
of problems and was really lucky to be

318
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,860
handed a bunch of them and it still

319
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,000
seems super weird to me that you can

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
make money doing this I'm not quite sure

321
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
how the world aligned with that worked

322
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,380
out

323
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,300
um I also want to call out the

324
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
co-authors and people that I whose work

325
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,420
I built on

326
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,100
um and also the great work that's been

327
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,480
done since because research is really

328
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,899
one Link in a chain or in a web and no

329
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,120
idea stands by itself it's really just a

330
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,339
part of a long series

331
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,660
um but it's trying to think of what to

332
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,700
say I went and went on Google Scholar

333
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,260
and pulled up the three papers Dan

334
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,240
mentioned and there were 18 000

335
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,519
citations for them and I had no idea

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,500
um and I lost my entire day looking at

337
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,880
really great work other people had done

338
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,260
which is partly why I'm a little bit

339
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,639
scattered right now as I was doing that

340
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,920
instead of preparing these comments

341
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,899
um but when I think about that just like

342
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,639
the tiny tiny percentage of the work

343
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,380
that I did was also super humbling

344
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,019
because it's a lot of you who've you

345
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,880
know cleaned up code bases and dealt

346
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,540
with these messes that really all I sort

347
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,339
of did at some level was to say Hey you

348
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,620
know way over there 100 miles outside of

349
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,660
town There's an evil monster living in a

350
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,240
cave and folks could have just said okay

351
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,560
an evil monster in the cave I'm gonna

352
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,000
keep doing my thing

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,380
um but you know this was the community

354
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,240
that kind of rode off on Horseback and

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,800
and tackled some of those monsters I'll

356
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,680
come back and do that in just a second

357
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,079
um but you know folks in this room who

358
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,060
did almost all of the work and I I did

359
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,820
three papers so you know that's

360
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,079
I probably shouldn't be getting the

361
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,220
award I should be chopping it up into

362
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,600
hundreds of pieces and giving you little

363
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,980
bits of it but it's too pretty so I'm

364
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,600
not going to do that

365
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,320
um

366
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,019
another little interesting story and

367
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,519
right after I presented the timing

368
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,380
attack paper at crypto 90 something this

369
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,940
was a long time ago

370
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,279
um somebody in a really friendly way so

371
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,660
it's really great paper

372
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,980
um this is after I gave my presentations

373
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,899
but it's an engineering paper not a

374
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,360
crypto paper and that comment sort of

375
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,560
stuck with me and you know now that I

376
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,420
think about it with a little more time I

377
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,279
actually think at the time it was true

378
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,079
um it was an engineering paper but it

379
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,579
was the crypto folks who took up the

380
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,260
challenge it wasn't the electrical

381
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,639
engineers it was you know the crypto

382
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,800
folks that went out and

383
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,480
I would say to tackle that monster but

384
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
it turns out there's a whole lot of

385
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,639
different monsters and we have a whole

386
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,260
biology of monsters and you know

387
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,639
different terminology for how to deal

388
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,320
with monsters and boxes to contain them

389
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,420
and it's been this community that's done

390
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,800
all of that really hard work and it

391
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,380
didn't have to be this world so uh thank

392
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
you to all of you here and I'm actually

393
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,940
really super proud more than of the work

394
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,199
but actually how the community is kind

395
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,760
of rallied around and expanded the

396
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
definition of what cryptography is and

397
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,440
when I say crypto I mean cryptography

398
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
not cryptocurrency

399
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
um to capture this sort of broader idea

400
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,180
and I think today those would be viewed

401
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,040
as you know that would be viewed as a

402
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
normal crypto paper to have

403
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,040
um

404
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,199
When I Look To The Future though of kind

405
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,579
of where we're headed

406
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,320
um I think it's super bright but kind of

407
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,940
in a dark way because you know it's like

408
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,199
telling somebody's working infectious

409
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,779
diseases their future is really bright

410
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,519
um but

411
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,440
you know there's this expanding Frontier

412
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,839
of technology and that obviously creates

413
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,300
more territory for us to analyze and to

414
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,860
try to protect

415
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,420
um but crypto is the one thing that

416
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,680
works right we have all these other

417
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,060
things that really haven't been nearly

418
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,560
as effective so we've got this sort of

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,300
unique tool set for tackling those

420
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,459
problems but that's also a really big

421
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,100
burden for a tiny community and we have

422
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,660
to tackle a lot of these challenges that

423
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,519
we don't have other tools but we're

424
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,139
cryptography and the math associated

425
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,880
with it has some chance of being

426
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,199
effective

427
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,300
um so in some ways maybe the biggest

428
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,220
Legacy of the side Channel work isn't

429
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,139
actually the papers but the people that

430
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,000
responded to them and the community that

431
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,040
expanded and is now able to handle these

432
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,300
even bigger problems that are going to

433
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,339
be coming along as these Frontiers keep

434
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,040
expanding out and you know being ready

435
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,959
to tackle those new monsters as they

436
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,579
come along now I want to point out that

437
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,860
expansion isn't just new subjects it's

438
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,240
also about making the community more

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,560
diverse including people with different

440
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
backgrounds and perspectives I've come

441
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,579
to this world as kind of an outsider

442
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,779
um most I don't think there's anybody

443
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,160
else here who just has an undergrad

444
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,399
degree in biology so you know but the

445
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,199
fact that it's welcoming of Outsiders

446
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,760
gives me a little bit of hope that maybe

447
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,560
for even some of the bigger broader

448
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,820
diversity questions that we have to

449
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,920
tackle and people are tackling that our

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,480
community is going to be more prepared

451
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,880
to deal with that and embrace that than

452
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,500
some others

453
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,459
um

454
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,199
so as I look forward to the future it's

455
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,459
obviously going to be messy but the

456
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,440
things that we do can determine whether

457
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,300
we have really messy outcomes or less

458
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,560
messy outcomes it's the same as medicine

459
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,579
you know you're not going to make all

460
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,500
people healthy all the time but it has a

461
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,540
huge impact and that's really what real

462
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,519
real world cryptography is about it's

463
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,380
about the stories we tell it's about how

464
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,300
those stories shift our mental models

465
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,940
and I'm kind of honored that some of the

466
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,380
papers that I wrote maybe shifted our

467
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,880
mental models a little bit and changed

468
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,680
the way that we look at how computer

469
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,300
systems work

470
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,019
um

471
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,839
and you know even with the case of the

472
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,819
the Specter paper which has I don't

473
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,740
think any mention of cryptography really

474
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,720
in the whole paper but it's the folks in

475
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,419
this community that really took up the

476
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,919
challenge in many cases of trying to

477
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,179
figure out what the solutions might look

478
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,640
like more so for example in many times

479
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,020
than the microprocessor people who

480
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,760
really were the ones living right next

481
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,160
to that particular Dragon so you know

482
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,439
when I look forward 20 years I'm really

483
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
looking forward to hearing what is our

484
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,280
definition of cryptography and how all

485
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,840
of us are going to shape that and you

486
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,740
know what's this world going to look

487
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,120
like and I'm super having a great time

488
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,460
being part of it and thank you all for

489
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,000
making it so much fun

490
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,599
[Applause]

491
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,080
thank you

492
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
[Applause]

493
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,179
awesome all right great so uh with that

494
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,299
let me just uh End by saying that uh the

495
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,480
Lufkin prize for wilro crypto 2024 is

496
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,220
seeking nominations you can find the

497
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,160
nomination page on the RWC website so if

498
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,100
you have an idea for someone who's you

499
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,900
