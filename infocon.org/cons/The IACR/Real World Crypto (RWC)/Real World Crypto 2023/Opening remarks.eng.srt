22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,879

warm welcome from my side

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,480
um the contributor talk chair of this

93
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,579
year's conference and katsu and I are

94
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,019
actually part of a larger organizing

95
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
company the steering committee which I

96
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,959
would like to introduce and give

97
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,460
particular credit to everyone who had a

98
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,600
dedicated role in this year's

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
organization

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,600
so to start with that would be Dan bunay

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,740
as the chair of the committee who

102
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,720
particularly um was organized or is

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
organizing the the left in price that

104
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,500
will be awarded later on today

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,600
then a second with a dedicated role was

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
Kenny Patterson who is a very important

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
uh sponsorship secretary because as you

108
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,600
know this conference is only possible

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,580
thanks to the generous donations we get

110
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,860
from I think Now 37 sponsors that allow

111
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,300
us to organize such a large conference

112
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,979
while keeping the registration costs low

113
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,020
and have a kind of diverse audience from

114
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,360
industry and Academia

115
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,220
um so next one to mention are Nadia

116
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,160
Henninger and Nick Sullivan who are both

117
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,560
the chairs for the invited Talk part of

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,580
the program

119
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,979
and our next one is Mariana raikova

120
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,900
who's a scholarship secretary so her

121
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,520
task was to spend part of the money that

122
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,380
Kenny raised and I think she got a

123
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,840
record of uh number but it was a record

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,360
of student scholarship applications and

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
she managed to give 86 students a travel

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,380
stipend so mainly paid by the article

127
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,720
RWC fund but also from NSF funds so I

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,740
think that's quite an impressive number

129
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,900
and again only possible thanks to our

130
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,520
sponsors

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,020
and actually she also has help from

132
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,639
Peter Schwab who's not only a webmaster

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,259
but supports with all the handling of

134
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,180
the payout of the of this of the

135
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,620
scholars

136
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,380
um and then yeah you have known uh Sako

137
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,820
so please kind of thank her every time

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,380
you see him for organizing this

139
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,600
wonderful conference here in Tokyo

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,139
all right

141
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,479
[Applause]

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,699
all right now kind of some quick words

143
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,699
to my parts I was the um the chair for

144
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,740
the contributor talks part of the

145
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,960
program and I was very lucky to have a

146
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,580
great program committee that supported

147
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,259
me in that and did all the hard work of

148
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,120
reviewing the submissions and shaping

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
the program

150
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
and I'm not going through the entire

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,840
list here but I would also really like

152
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
to thank all my Committee in particular

153
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,259
the one that joins uh on the last minute

154
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,360
because I actually had to enlarge the

155
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,340
program committee thanks to your many

156
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,620
submissions so we had a record of 135

157
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,479
submissions this year which was an

158
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,340
increase of almost 50 from the last

159
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,660
years

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,460
and I mean we only have a three day

161
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,520
conference uh one track uh program so we

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
could only accept as usual around 37 uh

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,680
talks to have them get merged so this

164
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,180
year we had actually a quite competitive

165
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,400
acceptance rate of below 30 percent

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,100
and deciding on the accepted talks was

167
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,479
quite challenging because more than half

168
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,340
of the submissions had only positive

169
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,240
reviews

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,800
so all the reviews I kind of decided

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,360
this would be really nice talk to C and

172
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
then it was kind of a hard task to

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,020
figure out which one uh kind of make it

174
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,759
into the final program so I actually got

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,139
a few emails when I sent out the review

176
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,639
comments that were asking me if I made a

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,780
mistake with a notification earlier

178
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,819
because everything was positive and the

179
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,080
only reason I could say is yeah there

180
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,460
was just too many good presentations

181
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,380
submitted and we only had a limited time

182
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,180
so with that I would also really thank

183
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,740
all the authors that submitted their

184
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,419
great work I'm very sorry we didn't work

185
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,780
