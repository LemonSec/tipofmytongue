1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,820
foreign

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,840
so this is going to be the closing

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,699
session

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,760
and I'd like to start by sharing with

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,939
you the participation statistics

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,980
in-person participants 650 and among 28

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,360
were students

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,180
well this was the limit because of this

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,000
venue I put it so you can't register

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,460
more than 650 which a little bit regret

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,700
and remote participation participants we

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,780
have 150 so overall it gives us exactly

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,280
800 and among them uh

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,020
216 were students

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,960
and why did I regret

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,760
this is the second highest in-person

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,979
iacr conferences ever

18
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,220
and so you might wonder why is it second

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,080
what's first

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,220
this highest was RWC 2020 in New York

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,479
and that was 655 participants so if I

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,860
didn't limit that to 650 make it in

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,540
656 then I'm sure I've made the the top

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,880
but anyway so thank you all for

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,920
participating participants and with

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,320
General responses we were able to offer

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,799
stipends to 84 students who came and

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,140
flew into Japan

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,939
uh so uh who are these uh 800 people so

30
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,880
this is from 43 countries and regions

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
and the US people from us were the

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,220
number one

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,860
235 then comes Japan Germany France and

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,380
then it goes on

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,619
well if you remember this is the first

36
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,880
RWC held in Asia so let's look at the

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,760
the regions so what happened was that

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,480
still uh it was the Europe people who

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,080
came uh well this is the uh total of

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,900
in-person and remote participants so it

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,420
was 40 percent but I think this is the

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,160
first first uh RW RWC that has more than

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,920
quarter of people from Asia so I think

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,580
this conference was a success and what

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,099
was interesting from my point of view if

46
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,640
we only look at the remote participant

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
the the graph is quite uh equally uh

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,860
balanced

49
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,879
okay

50
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,120
so uh as I said uh we had a lot of

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,879
generous sponsors so I would like to

52
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,239
start just like I did in the opening uh

53
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,700
I would like you to join me for thanking

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
