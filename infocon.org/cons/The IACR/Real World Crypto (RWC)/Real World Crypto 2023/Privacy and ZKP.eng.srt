1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,940
second session of today

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,120
we're going to have four talks in this

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,840
session and we start with an invited

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,259
talk by hinaka sugiyama on Android

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,379
encrypted and to end encryption in Japan

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,359
culture and policy

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,000
thank you so thank you very much for

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
having me

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,019
I'm a human rights lawyer protecting

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,779
freedom of expression and privacy and

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,460
I'm working for the international

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,619
Justice clinic at the University of

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,300
California so I came here from

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,059
California Irvine school of law where

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm lecturing and supervising law school

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,460
students but in my opinion and abuse

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,280
today I express are totally independent

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,399
from my clinic and the fun fact about me

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,340
is that I spent over 30 years in Japan

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,680
so I guess I have a little bit more

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,079
knowledge about some of you about Japan

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,180
so I would like to share with you

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,699
something about Japan as titles suggests

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,860
culture and the policy related to

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,719
encryption

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,740
so I think and I hope that you went out

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,780
and walked around the Tokyo a little bit

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,659
and so many beautiful interesting or

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,920
something weird

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,479
so I don't really have to explain

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,140
something visible in Japan so today I'm

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,360
going to explain or at least try to

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,640
explain something invisible and

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
something related to privacy and

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,420
encryption sounds are pretty challenging

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,759
and actually you know it was but I'll

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,240
try my best so are you ready

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,060
so okay so let me begin with the

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,380
statistics

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,479
um showing diversity overuse of

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,759
anonymous names and the real names on

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,720
Twitter

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,900
so this obviously shows that in Japan

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,540
more people are using Twitter on on

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,000
Anonymous basis meaning without

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,159
disclosing who they are in their real

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,180
lives

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,720
and it's a data in 2014 so it's a bit

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,840
old but the general impression is that

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,759
this situation has not been really

51
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,320
drastically changed since then

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,979
um

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,340
um sorry um it hasn't been really

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,640
translated but uh but I just wanted to

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,379
um explain that and just one more

56
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,760
statistics

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,140
um this shows whether people are

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,480
comfortable with revealing their real

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
names on social media or not and

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,720
um so this statistics shows that more

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,239
people say no and the less people say

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,280
yes in Japan compared it to other

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,580
countries and combining with these two

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,459
statistics perhaps we can say that that

65
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,640
in Japan more people are choosing to be

66
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,220
anonymous on Twitter to avoid their

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,379
activities on social media being

68
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,720
attributed to their real personalities

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
so then some of you might get curious

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,700
about so then how Twitter is used or

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,980
probably used to be used before the

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,620
ownership change so for an extra couple

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,900
of minutes I'd like to show you the

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,519
hashtag movement

75
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,400
or in other words online protests have

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,220
been happening here in Japan as well or

77
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,560
by using two recent examples

78
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,260
so why don't the representative hashtag

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,720
activities in Japan was like three years

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,080
ago a former Administration tried to

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,599
legislate a law that raises the

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,239
retirement age for public prosecutors up

83
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,819
to three years if that cabinet operates

84
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,239
so and the issue was the government did

85
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,040
not really provide a sufficient

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,519
explanation why this is needed

87
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,200
um and then which gives the impression

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,299
that the government tried to increase

89
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,760
its over power over the public

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,519
prosecutor's office and then an

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,239
anonymous Twitter user created a hashtag

92
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,120
saying protesting Amendment public

93
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,400
prosecutor's office law and it went

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,260
really viral

95
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,780
um and hashtag was reportedly used about

96
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,080
4 million times only in three days and

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,420
other Administration withdrew this bill

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,060
so and then Twitter Japan chose this

99
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,339
hashtag as the second biggest Twitter

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,459
Trend in 2020

101
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,880
so the next representative example is

102
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,300
kutsu movement there are sometimes a

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,580
really strict dress codes for women are

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,040
working places in Japan some something

105
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,699
like us BBC reported in 2019 like

106
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,940
prohibition of wearing glasses

107
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,979
um or the man that we're wearing of high

108
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,000
heels as this movement was about

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
um so a woman study a movement in 2019

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,759
to fight against a rule with the hashtag

111
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,000
kutsu as you see tactically she was

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
using the awake of global meeting

113
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,940
movement

114
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,820
and here kutsu means shoes in Japanese

115
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,580
and kutsu means pain

116
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,520
so um that movement got a lot of media

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
attention including New York Times in

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,180
2020

119
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,520
um with the woman's quote I kept

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,740
thinking why can't I talk the same way

121
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,000
as voice

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,900
in the true gender bias stereotypes have

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,340
been one of the major human rights

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,600
issues in Japan

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,820
the United Nations committee on the

126
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,380
elimination of discrimination against

127
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,280
women Sido also showed that continuous

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,539
concern about seeing Japan's persistent

129
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,580
patriarchal attitude and deep rooted

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,320
stereotypes um

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,740
about the roles and responsibilities of

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,259
men and women in the family and in

133
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,780
society which is reinforced by the

134
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,180
education media and also manga

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,560
kumikovics

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,780
and the BIOS and stereotypes are

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,520
resulted in the continuous poor

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,860
performance of Japan in gender equality

139
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,680
so in this index Japan has repeatedly

140
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,660
ranked as the lowest in Oil City

141
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,860
countries

142
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,900
so among other aspects women's

143
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,759
participation in political and public

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,560
discussion is also one of the major

145
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,840
factors which is lowering the ranking of

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,100
Japan

147
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,520
um just give you a sense of it this is

148
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,680
the current quesida cabinet members

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,919
so I'm just circling back to this first

150
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,560
statistics to sum up what I have

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,680
explained so far so Japanese people does

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,100
use Twitter or other online platforms as

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,919
a Civic space for Democratic discussion

154
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,160
or awareness raising of minority issues

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,860
including by women but the uniqueness

156
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,319
lies in the high rate of anonymous use

157
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,139
so the next question which I'd like to

158
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,780
address is why is that from cultural

159
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,120
perspective

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,139
okay

161
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,419
so

162
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,539
another statistic shows that these are

163
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,300
the top three what Japanese people think

164
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,180
as japanese-ness and non-japanese-ness

165
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,460
so let me just quickly go through

166
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,160
so um so first one is respect and

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
compassion for others respect

168
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
traditional cultures and customs and

169
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
pass them on to the next generation or

170
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,160
value family or Community ties and

171
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,740
emphasize Harmony and cooperation and

172
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,380
the non-japanese-ness is like finding

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,759
Beauty in things that are rational

174
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
functional in the utilitarian and the

175
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,900
second one is following one's own will

176
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,319
without being influenced by Authority or

177
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,400
power

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,020
for funding building in class your

179
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,319
gorgeous things okay so for me

180
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,699
um there's no surprise for this

181
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,400
statistics meaning yes I experienced

182
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,979
these discourses are really instilled in

183
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,620
education or mass media so it's a sort

184
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,599
of a natural consequences that people

185
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,520
characterize Japanese and the known

186
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,860
Japanese in these ways

187
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,680
and the thing is here

188
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,139
um so these you know share the values

189
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,900
which I just explained turns into one

190
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,500
Unwritten but pervasive Norm read the

191
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,319
air I just translated the Japanese idiom

192
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,860
into English but this consisting of two

193
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,220
sense of obligations the first one is do

194
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,039
what others are doing so as a result in

195
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,740
Japan once something is reported by a

196
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,440
mass media as a new coming Trend people

197
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,379
enthusiastic enthusiastically starts to

198
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,120
follow that trend

199
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,060
and the other one is refrain from doing

200
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,299
what others are not doing unless it is

201
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,059
strictly necessary so there might be

202
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,520
people who are feeling sick or sad I

203
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,620
mean that picture everyone is like seem

204
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,059
happy

205
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,979
um but there might be people who are

206
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,440
feeling sick or sad but people tended to

207
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,820
hide it

208
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,720
um because if not it causes sort of

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,459
self-humiliation that the person lacks

210
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,220
on important skills or even not fully

211
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,260
qualified as a full member of the

212
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,260
society or a fears of negative judgment

213
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,560
by others

214
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,839
there are pros and cons of this cultural

215
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,720
norm so the pro side people so people

216
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,880
are really good at acting in Conformity

217
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,220
and think twice before doing something

218
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,339
different from others so we enjoy very

219
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,500
low crime rate and also people

220
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,959
diligently wear Max masks during the

221
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,959
pandemic and but at the same time so on

222
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,240
the corn side people are not very used

223
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
to make one's own judgment for example

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
the government is saying that that um

225
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,120
government position is um wearing a mask

226
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,140
or not is up to one's decision

227
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,000
um but you see people a lot of people

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,940
just I'm wearing masks and it means

229
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,440
people are not really ready to make

230
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,140
one's own judgment and seeing how others

231
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,200
are behaving in the public places

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,620
and also according to 2018 statistics

233
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,899
and taken by the Japanese cabinet office

234
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,540
so in response to the questionnaire like

235
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,700
can you communicate your thoughts

236
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,040
clearly to others and then less than

237
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,779
half of Japanese people answered yes

238
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,540
compared to other countries were similar

239
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
to 80 people answered yes

240
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,459
and the second point which I would like

241
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,980
to emphasize today is hindering people

242
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,220
from speaking up and I believe that this

243
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,620
explains the high anonymity rate on

244
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,140
Twitter in Japan

245
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,019
um and also people are actually facing

246
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,839
um at a real consequences of the mere

247
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,360
fact of speaking up and which even

248
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,899
increasing the chilling effect on people

249
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,760
um and given that the lifetime

250
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
employment is still sort of prevalent at

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
certain degree so it causes significant

252
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,000
effect

253
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,339
um so there are um tons of examples but

254
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,899
I just for the sake of Simplicity

255
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,660
Simplicity of my presentation let me

256
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,240
just recycle uh that same example I used

257
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,600
so some celebrities also supported this

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,040
online protest

259
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,200
um under their real names and such as

260
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,260
actors actress singers musicians and

261
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,140
especially female celebrities

262
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,600
um but they were partially criticized by

263
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
people on Twitter by Media or other

264
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,339
celebrities not because of their

265
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,620
viewpoint but because they just spoke up

266
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,740
what I wanted to say here is Japan is a

267
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,600
Democratic Society it's not an

268
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,200
authoritarian country but rather so due

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,600
to its cultural norm speaking up is

270
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,240
still and the real names are not really

271
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,540
easy in Japan and the person who created

272
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,600
this hashtag says Twitter is is an

273
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,579
important tool for everybody to exercise

274
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,940
freedom of expression

275
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,160
so then

276
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,279
um

277
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,860
so yes I want to conclude here that

278
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,540
people need a space to exercise the

279
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,120
right to freedom of expression with

280
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
anonymity and for that purpose strong

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,279
privacy protection and encryption is

282
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,459
very important in Japan and as I assume

283
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,620
some of you think that this is not

284
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,839
really unique to Japan but it's rather

285
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,720
Universal when we see whistleblowers are

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,480
often subject to harassment so and if

287
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,959
you feel so I'm glad and I also expected

288
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,600
that reaction because that's the reason

289
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,120
why I keep putting the question mark

290
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,120
um like a Japanese culture because my

291
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,560
key message here

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,140
there's privacy and encryption are very

293
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,180
important in any Democratic countries

294
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,300
not only authoritarian countries

295
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,980
okay so this is the half of my

296
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,040
presentation so um okay so I will move

297
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,560
on to the encryption policy

298
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,660
um so I'd like to start with explaining

299
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,700
how the encryption has been used in

300
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,860
Japan by taking a look at the most

301
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,320
popular messaging app in Japan it's not

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,680
WhatsApp but it's lying

303
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,779
so in a statistics in 2022 last year so

304
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,760
in response to the question that which

305
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,040
messaging apps are you using at least

306
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,040
once a week and the lying was raised by

307
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,680
over 90 percent of people Twitter by 50

308
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,320
Instagram by 50 percent

309
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,560
and according to Ryan almost 1 million

310
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,260
regular users in Japan and also lying is

311
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,540
a major player in Thailand Taiwan and

312
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,940
Indonesia and there are also Emina

313
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,320
father expansion into Asia

314
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,540
and just like other messenger app people

315
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,600
can exchange texts images video and

316
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,360
conduct free VoIP conversations in the

317
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,000
signature function is these stickers and

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,500
they are really fun

319
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,079
and in addition dying is a platform

320
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,660
providing various Services include new

321
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,560
streaming online medical service or like

322
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,260
Lion TV or digital comic distribution

323
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,720
and online is also used for government

324
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,420
services like tax payment utility

325
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,060
payment or insurance payment

326
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,139
and since 2021 so just as a background

327
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,160
so line is um so 100 owned by the

328
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,440
Holdings Corporation it's the second

329
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,899
biggest total based public company in

330
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,079
Japan if in that company also owns Yahoo

331
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,600
Japan and other internet services

332
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,160
and

333
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,680
okay so Z Holdings is an indirectly

334
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,579
owned by SoftBank Corp which is a major

335
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,000
Investment Company and led by Mr son

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,700
masayoshi a billionaire an entrepreneur

337
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,980
in the philanthropist in Japan

338
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,680
and the lion was originally owned by

339
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,260
Korean parent company and

340
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
um still neighbor a Korean company owns

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,339
indirectly half of the financial stake

342
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,420
of the Holdings

343
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,899
okay so um dying started to apply letter

344
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,480
ceiling which is lines and to end

345
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,779
encryption protocol around the 2015 and

346
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,100
in 2016 and ended to index encryption is

347
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,320
applied by default on major services in

348
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,060
2017 line started to publish

349
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,600
transparency report which tells some I'm

350
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,519
saying just the same as other companies

351
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,579
the annual ungraduated data of their

352
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,920
provision of user data to in response to

353
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,380
the government's request and at that

354
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,060
time they started to disclose

355
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,579
transparency report then executive

356
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,800
officer who was in charge of privacy and

357
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,079
information security in line made

358
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,779
crystal clear in a media interview that

359
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,300
lying will never create a back door and

360
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,100
at least at that time

361
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,079
it has not been requested by the

362
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,120
Japanese government to create a back

363
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,019
door

364
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,480
and also lying also publishes encryption

365
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,860
report in Japanese and also in English

366
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,279
and also a uh and also encryption white

367
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,519
paper as well so basically compared with

368
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,279
other messaging apps in the world I

369
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,120
think lying is doing pretty great

370
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,820
um but the thing is on in 2021

371
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,600
investigative journalism revealed That

372
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,860
Dying made some of the messaging

373
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,560
contents accessible by employees in in

374
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,500
their Chinese subsidiary so it created a

375
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,720
public backlash from National Security

376
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,899
grounds but online immediately Savor the

377
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,839
Thai with the Chinese subsidiary but I

378
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,180
see lion generally enjoy trust from the

379
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,019
public

380
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,600
so the next slide I'm moving on to the

381
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,699
encryption regulation policy of the

382
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,300
Japanese government

383
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,259
so before on October 2020 I could not

384
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,540
find any position shown by the Japanese

385
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,779
government about encryption but suddenly

386
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,860
Japan joined a five eyes public call

387
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,600
with requested companies to create

388
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,360
encryption backdoor for anti-terrorism

389
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
crimes child sexual abuse materials

390
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,399
system

391
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
distribution and as you may know five

392
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,959
eyes is an intelligence Alliance

393
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,020
comprising of Australia Canada New

394
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,359
Zealand the UK and the United States and

395
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,640
these countries are parties to a treaty

396
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,859
for joint intelligence activities such

397
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,740
as bulk data collection of which abuse

398
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,319
Edward Snowden revealed in the European

399
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,959
Court of Human Rights decided that that

400
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,419
it violated the rights of privacy under

401
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,699
the European Convention of Human Rights

402
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,360
and notoriously um around the 2017 five

403
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,280
eyes has been calling for encryption

404
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,500
back door in the Japan

405
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,419
in 2020 and signed on this statement

406
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,059
and I researched the discussion at the

407
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,700
time but I could not really find any

408
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,760
policy discussion around encryption and

409
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,500
the news article also failed to

410
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,900
articulate what is a policy discussion

411
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,200
behind this back door request but two

412
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
months before this news then defense

413
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,140
Prime defense minister Mr cono public

414
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,360
showed his position that Japan should

415
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,580
strengthen their relationship with five

416
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,919
eyes in response to China's military

417
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,280
expansion so it seems that this is

418
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,620
foreign policy driven hasted poster

419
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,840
without a domestic policy discussion

420
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
including like implication with the

421
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
privacy and freedom of expression and

422
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
democracy and after that as far as I

423
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,400
researched it's not really crystal clear

424
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,799
because available information is really

425
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
limited on this matter but it didn't

426
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
lead to visible legislative policy

427
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
effort for encryption regulation or

428
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,860
mandatory screening of emails or

429
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,220
messages

430
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,000
and

431
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,039
um okay so one thing also I should very

432
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,960
briefly touch upon is the concept of

433
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,660
data free flow with the trust uh the

434
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,720
former prime minister Abe

435
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,179
proposed as dfft at the doubles meeting

436
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,460
a couple of years ago

437
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,620
um as an overarching framework of

438
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,140
cross-border data transfer and the Japan

439
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,600
has been trying to take a lead in the

440
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,880
international coordination of the

441
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,160
expansion of cross-border data transfer

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,220
mainly through trade agreements

443
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,280
um but this dffd policy is highly

444
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,799
economically driven policy so it seems

445
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,260
the encryption regulation has not been

446
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,500
really on the agenda so far so in the

447
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,480
next slide I'd like to take a look at

448
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
the domestic policy discussion over

449
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,380
Online safety in general

450
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,440
okay so since 2018

451
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,679
um the ministry uh in charge of the

452
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,020
regulation of ICT sector has been

453
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,660
holding an expert panel to discuss in

454
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,580
the former policy on the business of

455
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,460
online platforms and overall the

456
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,559
discussion around content moderation was

457
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,840
directed towards the self-regulation

458
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,380
like the United States by platforms but

459
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,860
in 2020 one of the women who were in the

460
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,140
reality TV show tell us the house

461
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,679
Terrace house so that person committed

462
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,500
suicide reportedly because she had been

463
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,780
harassed on Twitter by Anonymous users

464
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
as you may know Terrace House follows

465
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,660
the lives of six strangers Three Men and

466
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,240
three women until they live in the same

467
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
house while getting to know each other

468
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,799
and start to date each other

469
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,140
and in Japan this program was really

470
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,360
influential and popular

471
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,900
so this sad incident sparked the

472
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,240
domestic discussion about regulation of

473
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,460
online speech platforms to fight against

474
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,460
harassment and disinformation

475
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,400
and the good news for us or at least for

476
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,679
me is the discussion are moving toward

477
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
the direction of requiring a disclosure

478
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,940
of the platform's content modulation

479
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,340
policy in the status of its

480
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,440
implementation and also resource

481
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,240
allocation to content moderation

482
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
function and it's similar to the Digital

483
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,679
Services act in the in the EU and this

484
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,020
um supports it policy direction does not

485
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,179
really include a measure which would

486
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,880
compromise encryption such as mandatory

487
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,620
scanning over user to user

488
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,900
Communications like the earn it act in

489
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,880
the United States or UK Online safety

490
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,700
Bill or eu's Bill

491
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,320
so

492
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,299
um and also one of the reasons why the

493
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,460
discussion is going to this direction in

494
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,679
Japan is that the Constitutional

495
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,679
Scholars and the lawyers are leading a

496
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,419
discussion and they have a clear

497
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,760
position that Anonymous speech is

498
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,799
important from constitutional

499
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,020
perspective and I really appreciate

500
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,900
their strong position

501
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,900
okay so and don't worry I'm concluding

502
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,120
my presentation this is the last slide

503
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,860
so again

504
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,620
um information is limited but no visible

505
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,940
active

506
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,799
um effort or the encryption regulation

507
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,559
is not really happening in Japan but the

508
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,200
situation would change of course a

509
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,840
foreign policy May create a momentum to

510
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,179
push regulation

511
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,940
um also I might have to say that in past

512
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,100
10 years the situation of a freedom of

513
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,480
expression in Japan got worse as we see

514
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
um the the freedom of press index in

515
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,220
Japan has been really steadily declining

516
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,980
so we needed to be coasters

517
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,960
about the encryption regulation in Japan

518
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,419
given especially the importance of

519
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,059
privacy under Japanese culture which

520
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,280
which I explained today

521
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,159
so however I don't see robust public

522
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,500
debate in Japan about importance of

523
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,020
encryption or regulation so some

524
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,539
security researchers energyos are

525
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,179
writing the blog posts on this issue but

526
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:43,860
major media companies are not really

527
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,260
following the entity and the encryption

528
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,200
regulation in Japan so I believe that to

529
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
vitalize the discussion reports from

530
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
oversea Media or energyos would be also

531
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,820
one of the drivers to vitalize the

532
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,820
domestic discussion so if any of you are

533
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,640
interested in writing about freedom of

534
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,440
expression or privacy or encryption in

535
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,020
Japan I'd be very happy to collaborate

536
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,600
with you so um just please reach out to

537
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
me so thank you very much

538
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,820
yeah thank you very much for the talk

539
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,419
are there any questions in the audience

540
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,100
doesn't look like

541
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,559
um I don't see the online questions at

542
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,419
the moment I don't know I can do this

543
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,020
but yeah maybe then I ask a question so

544
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,900
um about the history of the discussion

545
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,440
maybe of encryption so when encryption

546
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,000
first got uh yeah it basically

547
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,740
accessible to the public in the 90s we

548
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,020
had this backlash in the US and Northern

549
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,360
Europe which are maybe now called crypto

550
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,940
walls where governments tried to

551
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,919
basically prohibit use of encryption

552
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,039
versus something similar in Japan

553
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,720
um you mean that time when the

554
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,000
encryption yeah so in the 90s mostly

555
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,020
yeah

556
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,179
um I I didn't find you know any like

557
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,559
strong position of the Japanese

558
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,960
government that first one is as I

559
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
mentioned in 2020 uh when they joined

560
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,020
the five is cause so rather it's more

561
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,840
like company driven I suppose in Japan

562
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,200
so um so uh so so the company

563
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,820
implemented that strong protection of

564
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,159
encryption so that got sort of

565
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,740
standardized in Japan so I think yeah

566
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,559
that's a brief answer to that question

567
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
okay thank you very much and then let's

568
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,760
I think at the question I think yeah

569
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,820
we actually have one question in the in

570
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,280
the audience yeah I was going to ask how

571
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,320
you think about the balance of

572
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,679
supporting Anonymous free speech for

573
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,679
people's expression against the balance

574
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,140
of protecting Anonymous speech uh from

575
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,760
harassment like the example you

576
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
mentioned in Terrace House what's the

577
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
trade-off in supporting those and is

578
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
there a good way to navigate it thank

579
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,740
you very much

580
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,620
[Music]

581
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,799
like prevent the uh the only harassment

582
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,140
against like free speech

583
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,140
um is a uh there are other tons of

584
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,559
measures to implement it for just public

585
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,520
education to stop it or um the people

586
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,659
who are subjective harassment so

587
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,000
it's also possible that that person can

588
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,520
mute that you know negative remarks

589
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,279
about that expression

590
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,059
um so but on the other hand you know

591
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:43,919
regulating the encryption or Anonymous

592
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,039
speech in general that is far more you

593
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,500
know bigger harms or damages about the

594
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,419
freedom of expression in Japan so um so

595
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,640
to you know that most like discrete way

596
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,159
to address that issue is to think about

597
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,500
what sort of like various measures can

598
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,020
be taken for the online harassment or

599
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,779
other harmful content

600
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,740
yeah thanks

601
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,200
I um thank you for the talk I just have

602
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,940
a question about this last point where

603
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,880
you say a more robust public debate is

604
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,980
needed but what are the mechanisms for

605
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,960
doing that when speaking up is very

606
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,340
difficult or frowned upon

607
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,580
um

608
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,919
so sorry could you repeat that yeah so

609
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,539
um if if you say a more robust public

610
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,120
debate is needed about end-to-end

611
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,299
encryption how do you get that going if

612
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,360
speaking up is very difficult to do

613
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,100
yeah um thank you so much yeah so

614
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,279
um possibly people can start to talk

615
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,059
about this issue on Anonymous basis yeah

616
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,200
so that's one way to do it yeah to just

617
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,100
to speak just start the conversation

618
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,039
yeah and also the you know the company

619
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,200
that I incorporation is really doing

620
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,480
very hard to you know sort of educate

621
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,360
people on the ground that you know their

622
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,460
Technologies their the encryption

623
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,200
technology is pretty important for

624
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,520
people

625
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,500
um but but at the same time you know

626
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,020
sort of Japanese people people's mind is

627
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,360
sort of paralyzed a little bit uh

628
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,640
because we are so that used to you know

629
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,500
not to speak up

630
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,820
um so yeah so but the only way I think I

631
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,580
can do we can do is you know start to

632
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,080
talk about it so

633
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,840
thank you

634
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,960
okay I think there are no more questions

635
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,059
so then let's ask the speaker again

636
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,600
thank you

637
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,039
okay so the next talk is by Kasra who's

638
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,140
going to defend the speed shifun and

639
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,900
he's going to speak about data share

640
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,520
Network a decentralized privacy

641
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,440
preserving search engine for invested

642
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,799
investigative journalists thanks

643
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,500
so hello I'm castra nice to meet you

644
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,720
today I'm going to present datashare

645
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,580
Network which is a collaboration with

646
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,260
International Consortium of

647
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,559
investigative journalists or icij

648
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,860
so let me tell you about icij they are

649
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,480
okay going fast

650
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,000
uh they are a Global Network of

651
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,700
journalists with over 250 journalists in

652
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,320
100 countries

653
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,539
and they are mostly well known for their

654
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,880
work on Panama papers which has won them

655
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,340
a policy robot now I'm gonna open up

656
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,460
this a bit more to see how icg operates

657
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,740
this has started when a vital blur

658
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,500
leaked over 11 million document to this

659
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,140
organization and these documents were

660
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,720
already digital and coming in many

661
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,620
different formats like images text

662
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,539
emails and they had to develop their own

663
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,840
tool to process this data using OCR NLP

664
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,659
and actually this Source this tool is

665
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,880
already available open source on their

666
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,840
site

667
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,600
and you can use it yourself too and more

668
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
specifically what this does is that it

669
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,899
takes a document it extracts people

670
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,880
organizations and locations that are

671
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,220
mentioned inside and journalists

672
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,740
workflow is mainly following links

673
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
between multiple documents to get what

674
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,539
is the big picture

675
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,600
after using this tool to search locally

676
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,120
and centrally journalists came up with

677
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,600
ambition of can we extend this to do

678
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,580
search in a journalistic journalism

679
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,059
manner without endangering ourselves and

680
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,799
that's when they came to us with this

681
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,539
problem

682
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,659
and their needed functionality is first

683
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,299
and foremost being able to search

684
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,600
they want to see they have an

685
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,640
investigation topic they want to see if

686
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,220
there is any other journalist in the

687
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,740
network who has relevant document about

688
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,360
this investigation

689
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,299
and after finding this person the second

690
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,760
functionality is being able to contact

691
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,520
them and they want to have an anonymous

692
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,039
screening talk between them

693
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,140
it's important to note that there is no

694
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,440
document retrieval in our system because

695
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,419
journalists may not want to share

696
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,679
depending on who their collaborator is

697
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,480
and if they want to share at the end

698
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,600
they can use existing tools

699
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,140
next we ask them what are you afraid of

700
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,940
and they told us that they trust each

701
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
other and they trust the organization

702
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,820
and they are mainly worried about

703
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,500
third-party adversaries like governments

704
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,779
hackers and corporations

705
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,299
but part of this study they told us that

706
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,700
they are worried about hacking violence

707
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,940
subpoenas and these things can coerce or

708
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,580
compromise journalists or the

709
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,059
organization so to prevent harm we had

710
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,039
to consider them malicious for

711
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,320
protecting both them as becoming a

712
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,539
valuable Target and harming others in

713
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,580
the end

714
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,679
now let me give you a bit more specific

715
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,539
on privacy requirement

716
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,120
we need to make sure that when doing a

717
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,799
query uh The Courier can hide her

718
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,140
identity and the content of the query

719
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,899
which is her investigation and on the

720
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,419
other side document owners want to

721
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,260
protect the content of documents

722
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm going a bit fast here sir and when

723
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,240
in the contact phase

724
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,419
journalists want to hide both the

725
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,360
content and existence of any

726
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,959
conversation

727
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,840
as for operational constraint we need to

728
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,419
support up to thousand journalists and

729
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,220
each journalist has gathered around

730
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,020
thousand documents on their personal

731
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,299
computer over the time

732
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,179
before trying to build a system we ask

733
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,200
icij about their I.T infrastructure and

734
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,840
they told us that they can only deploy

735
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,260
servers on clouds like Google Cloud

736
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,140
Amazon Cloud and they do not have their

737
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,380
own uh big it servers and this means

738
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,899
that any approach that relies on

739
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,720
decentralized thrust or any trust is

740
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,039
infeasible

741
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,500
and beyond that they told us that these

742
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,539
journalists are not willing to upload

743
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,360
their documents for processing to clouds

744
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,399
so trusted third parties out of the

745
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,140
question too

746
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,960
next part as you can see in this image

747
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,419
these Uranus are moving all across the

748
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,580
globe they work at different time zone

749
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,860
and sleep at different time zones so

750
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,779
some of them are never online at the

751
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,740
same time

752
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,840
so we need to deal with asynchronous

753
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,779
this means that any approach that relies

754
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,440
on multi-run SMC or MPC protocol is out

755
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,059
of question two

756
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,059
and finally some of the countries as you

757
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,100
can see in here especially in the middle

758
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,640
do not have fast reliable and unlimited

759
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,880
internet connection so communication is

760
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,360
a scarce resource for us and is more

761
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,240
important than computation so approaches

762
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,039
like garbage circuit and fully

763
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,720
homomorphic encryption is out of

764
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,000
question two

765
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,179
to wrap this up we can only have a

766
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,220
single malicious server

767
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,460
that is only trusted for availability

768
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,880
now let's build our document search

769
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
the Privacy recap is this search needs

770
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,000
to protect the query documents and the

771
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,100
result of matching

772
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,159
and the search can be simplified as our

773
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,679
queried keywords inside the document or

774
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,399
not

775
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,500
and to do this we design a new

776
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,379
cryptographic primitive called multi-set

777
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,560
private set intersection which is an

778
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,540
extension of a product that you are

779
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,540
already familiar with called PSI where

780
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,060
Bob has a set of input elements and a

781
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,080
secret key

782
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,480
Alice has a set of keywords too and

783
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,460
first Bob computes a prf with his key or

784
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,379
his element and send them as tax to

785
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,679
Alice and next Alice and Bob perform an

786
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,719
oblivious prf together where Alice can

787
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,899
compute prfs with Bob's key and her

788
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,599
keyboards and by comparing these two

789
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,480
sets of tags together Alice can compute

790
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,339
the intersection

791
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,320
now this is great when you have one

792
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
document

793
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,639
we have thousands it's becoming a bit

794
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,839
more troublesome

795
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,300
and we have thousands of journalists now

796
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,859
this is prohibitive

797
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,500
and what we do next is that we extend

798
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,800
this protocol to remove the Thousand uh

799
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,480
factor that we get from having many

800
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,560
documents and to do that we allow Bob to

801
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,200
have many documents and many sets at the

802
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,900
same time and to do so we added

803
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,859
diversifying step to how we process our

804
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,060
tax that after Computing the prf we hash

805
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,940
them with a document identifier we keep

806
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,480
the oprf part intact and in the end

807
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,240
Alice can locally compute the same

808
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,000
diversifying hash and compute the

809
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,780
intersection for different documents

810
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,660
moreover we can do this in a setup

811
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,119
online phase that's the

812
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,640
expensive part of computing tags in the

813
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,900
beginning and sending them to

814
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,480
journalists can happen only once and

815
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,480
it's reusable to reduce the cost

816
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,000
and as you can see here this drastically

817
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,900
reduces the cost and make it practical

818
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,720
for our deployment

819
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,480
next there is a problem in here that we

820
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,520
are considering a new

821
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,280
a stronger privacy setting we have

822
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,740
confidential documents and we give

823
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,440
search access to the adversive there are

824
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,260
some fundamental limits in here like

825
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,220
again double clicking that can be hide

826
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,980
the existence of uh

827
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,260
Snowden leaks from like this adversary

828
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,300
in here

829
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,780
and as you see you know this as a

830
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,119
disclaimer is an out of context code

831
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,400
but I don't really mind me telling you

832
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,099
that you cannot hide these node on leaks

833
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,460
but to show you how this happens is that

834
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,060
many of these investigations have a

835
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,400
specific terminology in them like there

836
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,460
is a word X key score that only happens

837
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,420
in the concepts of Snowden licks and if

838
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,520
adversary search is a keyword like this

839
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,160
and find a match then it's clear that

840
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,260
the only way that this can happen is

841
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,480
that these documents are leaked

842
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,400
while I'm telling you that some

843
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,920
protection is not possible at all

844
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,140
not all these laws and there is still

845
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,940
some level of protection that we can

846
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,579
provide and this mainly goes into

847
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,859
preventing extraction of keys from

848
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,160
documents and the most practical way to

849
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,140
do this is by rate limiting uh

850
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,140
the number of queries and the amount of

851
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,540
information in each query and to do this

852
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,280
we use a

853
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,060
single use blind tokens that have the

854
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,280
additional benefit of allowing us to do

855
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,300
authentication and make sure that only

856
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,400
authorized icig journalists can perform

857
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,940
a search

858
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,740
now that we are done with the document

859
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,099
search let's start with our contact

860
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,099
solution

861
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,640
and as a recap this contact needs to

862
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,000
hide both the conversation and its

863
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,339
existence

864
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,520
so first we try to use existing systems

865
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,220
but none of them fully satisfied our

866
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,660
requirement

867
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,060
for example if we want to use signal or

868
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,800
Terra Glam you need to start with

869
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,079
telling them what is your telephone

870
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,940
number and you cannot hide this kind of

871
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,940
metadata and when you go to Solutions

872
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,700
like talks which is an anonymous

873
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,920
messaging relying on tour hidden

874
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,079
Services you have the requirement that

875
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,359
both user needs to be online so they do

876
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,400
not support asynchrony

877
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,980
so in the end we had to build our own

878
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,079
Anonymous massive immune system

879
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,859
and to do so we use a DP Helmet Key

880
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,440
exchange between an ephemeral key of a

881
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,500
courier and a document owner key

882
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,859
to compute a random or roundable mailbox

883
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,960
to exchange messages

884
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,940
and whenever we want to send a message

885
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,780
we add cover messages and shape outgoing

886
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,380
traffic based on a person distribution

887
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,560
on the other hand when retrieving

888
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,180
messages we use private information

889
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,000
retrieval to hide the ID of which

890
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
messages are getting downloaded

891
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,280
and in the end we integrate Tor into our

892
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,859
system to make sure that none of this

893
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,980
except leak Network artifacts to

894
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,200
adversary can which can be used against

895
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,480
this journalists

896
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,940
now that we designed the system we

897
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,400
perform a user study to help us

898
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
configure the trade-offs that we have

899
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,820
uh

900
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,780
okay

901
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,599
and we mainly care about three types of

902
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,940
trade-off functionality

903
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,820
career privacy and document owner

904
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,440
privacy

905
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,619
and to do this we show three systems to

906
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,900
journalists and I'm only going to talk

907
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,400
about two of them here

908
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,040
the first one is the mspsi protocol that

909
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,660
we built earlier

910
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,880
and the second one is an off-the-shelf

911
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,940
search engine called called Lucin which

912
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,859
is very similar to what you get when

913
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,380
interacting with Google this gives you

914
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,240
way less privacy but better

915
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,800
functionality

916
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,440
and in here I'm showing you the response

917
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,920
for two of these search engines I know

918
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,260
that you cannot see details but in this

919
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,700
slide it's not really important it's

920
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,339
just the size that matter that you can

921
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,859
already without details see that the

922
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,380
size and expressiveness in leucine is

923
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,940
way more than what we can provide

924
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,480
and next we design our user interviews

925
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,859
fortunately for us we are working with

926
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,440
journalists so we ask them can you build

927
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,540
a fake investigation for us

928
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,480
and we ask them to only use publicly

929
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,119
available leaked documents to do this

930
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,540
and we start interviews by telling the

931
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,960
user that pretend you're Jamie Jamie is

932
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,240
a journalist working on tax evasion by

933
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,320
big Corp

934
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,140
then we tell Jamie that

935
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,900
you have some tasks to perform for

936
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,960
example you heard rumors that Verizon is

937
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,520
doing tax evasion

938
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,040
can you find a journalist who has

939
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,760
relevant document for this investigation

940
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,099
and finally this is a peer-to-peer

941
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,140
system but we are interviewing one

942
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,760
journalist at a time

943
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,760
to be able to handle this we simulate

944
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,700
the rest of the network and tell Jamie

945
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,500
that hey there are 10 other guys in the

946
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,079
network two of them are taken hostage by

947
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,560
bad guys

948
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,720
now as you have seen before seeing the

949
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,400
functionality a system is

950
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,339
straightforward but how can we show the

951
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,800
Privacy to them we rely on two

952
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,900
approaches first we give them

953
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,020
interactive hints that when they do

954
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,200
their first PSI query we show them that

955
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,760
if you want to

956
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,940
query for term tax you need to send a

957
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,380
random blob

958
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,079
and we ask them to write this random

959
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,359
blob done and configure that this is

960
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,940
what's sent over the network then we go

961
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,339
to losing and tell them that oh if you

962
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,920
want to search Trump you need to type

963
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,900
Trump in and this is what everyone in

964
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,359
the network sees and we actually show

965
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,920
them that the queries that are arriving

966
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
that's for example here for PSI these

967
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,720
are just random blobs that they cannot

968
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,480
make any sense out of it

969
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,660
the next part is we flip the table and

970
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,720
we give them an adversarial view we

971
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,260
build an over-the-shoulder view where we

972
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,660
translate the leakage to what other

973
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,900
journalists can learn about them like we

974
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,400
attend other journals in the network

975
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,160
like Charlie and we tell them what

976
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,619
Charlie knows about your documents and

977
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,079
again in here you may not see the detail

978
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,780
well and the only part that matters is

979
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,599
that the size of information that

980
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,819
is available in Louisiana you can

981
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,380
already see it's more than what happens

982
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,599
in mspsi

983
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,760
and we are very explicit with

984
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,220
journalists that this view that you get

985
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,339
here is only available and possible

986
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:22,279
during this uh simulation

987
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,619
our peer Elemental result is that

988
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:29,180
despite the lower functionality of mspsi

989
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,859
journalists prefer it because of its

990
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,020
privacy

991
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,880
while

992
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,300
doing the user study we went ahead

993
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,640
and develop the systems and now I'm

994
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,040
going to share some of the lesson that

995
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,300
we learned during this process

996
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,839
okay so first we had four major aspects

997
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,079
in our deployment that we needed to deal

998
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,619
with UI ux authentication document

999
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,380
search and messaging and the first you

1000
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,740
are not that visible into the academic

1001
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,579
setting of writing the system

1002
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:10,500
and our first lesson is started when we

1003
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,960
try to build and integrate our

1004
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,359
authentication system that you need to

1005
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,880
deal with Legacy code

1006
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,640
so in our paper we used Anonymous

1007
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,980
credential light and Abby's blind

1008
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,099
signature for this uh single-use blind

1009
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,000
tokens

1010
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,920
they are very well known uh

1011
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,140
cryptographics primitive I think we even

1012
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,940
have authors here and theory is done

1013
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,520
good approach secret approach everything

1014
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,220
perfect and implemented it is very

1015
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,400
straightforward too the problem comes up

1016
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
with the fact that this urinals are very

1017
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,700
wise and they have multi-factor

1018
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,640
Authentication

1019
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,740
and one extra part of this is that they

1020
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,599
have their own internal oauth system

1021
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,900
which is an uh something built in house

1022
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,380
using Ruby on Rails with a lot of

1023
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,900
interesting things inside that make this

1024
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,760
integration very memorable

1025
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,220
the next lesson is that you need to

1026
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,619
prepare for having a cold start

1027
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,119
we need to design the system for its

1028
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,520
stress test of like having 1000 users

1029
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,000
but we are going to just start with tens

1030
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,420
of users and

1031
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,940
reached to 300 active journalists in a

1032
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,079
few years

1033
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,660
this is a very different operational

1034
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,859
point

1035
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:37,920
and for some aspects like privacy which

1036
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,300
loves company

1037
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,660
uh parameters that are secure and

1038
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,359
private for thousand users may not be

1039
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,319
safe for just having 10.

1040
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,060
and

1041
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,500
okay

1042
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,260
okay the final lesson is don't think

1043
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,760
complicated

1044
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,000
when we designed the messaging system we

1045
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,040
were arguing internally that we need to

1046
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,839
use a PR

1047
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,839
should we use computational PIR and add

1048
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,760
homomorphic encryption

1049
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,819
or we should go differential private way

1050
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,099
and do Epsilon PIR

1051
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,819
in the end what we deployed

1052
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,579
is hell no we are not going any of them

1053
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,460
we are going to download all messages

1054
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,640
this is fast efficient and private for

1055
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,940
our setting when we are in our beginning

1056
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,640
phase then after deploying this and

1057
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,700
system getting more use we have time to

1058
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,480
slowly build on top of this and build

1059
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
algorithms that allow us to scale at the

1060
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,359
later stages

1061
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,040
now I'm gonna tell you why I think

1062
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,839
datashare has succeeded and we are

1063
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,720
getting deployed and the funny thing is

1064
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,420
that most of these reasons are not

1065
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,819
visible at all during the stock to this

1066
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,020
point

1067
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,480
first we are working with real

1068
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,119
journalists they wanted to have these

1069
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,520
two and they were pushing to make it as

1070
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,740
usable for them as possible

1071
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,660
and to do this

1072
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,599
they were involved in all the stages of

1073
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,339
this process they were there during

1074
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,240
requirement Gathering design user study

1075
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
and finally in the development and

1076
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,680
deployment

1077
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,260
and next part is that we had amazing

1078
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,720
dedicated engineering team both in our

1079
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,560
lab and with journalists and they were

1080
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,200
the ones who built this system

1081
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,119
and finally

1082
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,520
there is a lot of time and resources

1083
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,160
spent on making this system we where

1084
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,680
many people we work for the better half

1085
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,420
of the decade

1086
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,900
the paper came two years ago and we just

1087
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,420
reached to our first beta test in like

1088
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,660
two weeks ago which is a very long span

1089
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,940
of time for spending on one academic

1090
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,119
paper

1091
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,920
and that's it if you want to have a

1092
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,920
usable Deployable system researchers are

1093
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,339
not enough you need to have users and

1094
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,619
Engineers to build the system too

1095
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,460
and thank you for listening to me

1096
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,619
as caregiver mentioned earlier on

1097
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,740
finishing my thesis soon and I'm on the

1098
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,859
job market too so if you have anything

1099
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,960
interesting you want to talk or email I

1100
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,480
would be super happy to do that

1101
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,079
thanks

1102
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:37,819
[Applause]

1103
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:42,200
yeah thank you very much any questions

1104
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,200
this time I also see the only questions

1105
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,839
that they are now

1106
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,000
um yeah then I think in the interest of

1107
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,520
time since we're a bit over already

1108
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,610
Let's uh I think the speaker again

1109
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:03,649
[Applause]

1110
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,579
okay so our next talk is uh by Trisha

1111
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,119
data on using ZK proofs to fight this

1112
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,500
information

1113
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,700
please

1114
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,359
can everyone hear me yeah great so hi my

1115
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:31,980
name is Trisha dada and today I'm going

1116
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,420
to be presenting joint work with Dan

1117
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,940
Bonnet on using zero knowledge proofs to

1118
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,339
fight disinformation and I'm sure over

1119
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,020
the past few years we've all heard a lot

1120
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,000
about misinformation and disinformation

1121
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,099
my talk today is going to focus

1122
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,720
specifically on photographic

1123
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,240
misinformation and disinformation and in

1124
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,560
particular I'm going to be talking about

1125
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,300
this issue of image provenance

1126
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,400
verification now when I say image

1127
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,380
provenance verification that's basically

1128
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,359
just a fancy way of saying that we'd

1129
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,280
like to be able to verify when and where

1130
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,680
images have been taken and we think that

1131
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,000
this kind of verification is

1132
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,680
particularly important in the realm of

1133
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,660
Journalism in news media so imagine

1134
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,000
you're looking at a news article on your

1135
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,119
phone or on a browser on your computer

1136
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,619
you'd like to be sure that the photos

1137
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,599
that you're seeing in the article were

1138
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,040
actually taken when and where the

1139
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,260
article claims they were taken and to

1140
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,880
give you an idea of why we think some

1141
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,680
kind of formal verification might be

1142
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,240
useful on the next slide I'm going to

1143
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,160
give you some examples of where this

1144
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,060
verification would have been very useful

1145
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,579
uh so one example of a recent event

1146
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,020
where there's been a lot of photographic

1147
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,880
misinformation is the Russian invasion

1148
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,160
of Ukraine and here we've seen a couple

1149
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,319
different flavors of disinformation so

1150
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,599
one is where you'll see a picture that

1151
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,400
is supposedly of Ukraine but is actually

1152
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,140
of somewhere completely different like

1153
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,440
Syria and so in that case you'd like to

1154
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,000
have been able to verify where the photo

1155
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,400
had actually been taken you also see

1156
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,200
instances where the pictures you're

1157
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,000
seeing are actually of Ukraine but they

1158
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,680
were taking years before The Invasion

1159
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,900
and so the in those instances you'd like

1160
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,400
to have been able to verify when the

1161
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,160
photos had actually been taken

1162
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,200
in addition to kind of just sewing

1163
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,119
confusion and being generally incorrect

1164
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,579
misinformation can also act actively

1165
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,380
cause harm so with the recent

1166
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,119
devastating earthquake in turkey and

1167
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,020
Syria

1168
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,480
misinformation was actually actively

1169
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,119
prevented or sorry actively impeding

1170
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,920
relief efforts because it was preventing

1171
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,020
human nature humanitarian organizations

1172
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,079
from knowing how to best allocate their

1173
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,420
limited resources

1174
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,160
and this last example I actually think

1175
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,260
is the most compelling in terms of what

1176
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,380
I'm going to talk about today so uh

1177
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,599
basically what happened is a BBC show

1178
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,460
showed footage of what was supposedly

1179
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,380
the Russian invasion of Ukraine but it

1180
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,240
was actually just footage of a Russian

1181
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,119
military parade rehearsal and the reason

1182
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,740
why I think that this is particularly

1183
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,960
compelling and motivating is that the

1184
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,059
BBC is a reputable news organization

1185
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,579
presumably they have teams of human fact

1186
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,980
Checkers and verifiers whose job is to

1187
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,059
make sure that this kind of thing

1188
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,160
doesn't happen and so the fact that it

1189
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,420
still happened means that there's

1190
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,099
definitely room for improvement in

1191
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,960
current image provenance verification

1192
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,359
processes and of course there are policy

1193
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,460
responses that could take place but

1194
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,079
hopefully what this talk will convince

1195
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,700
you of is that the there are also

1196
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,260
Technical Solutions that can be

1197
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,819
developed and that's where we as

1198
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,380
computer scientists and cryptographers

1199
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,660
can come in

1200
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,880
so one example of a technical Solution

1201
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,400
that's been proposed is the c2pa which

1202
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,859
is a Content provenance standard and the

1203
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:31,200
content the ctpa has been developed in

1204
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,400
conjunction by a bunch of different

1205
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,200
organizations including Tech

1206
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,940
organizations like Twitter and Microsoft

1207
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,160
as well as news media organizations like

1208
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,220
the BBC and essentially what the c2pa

1209
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,380
proposes is that every digital camera be

1210
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,000
equipped with an embedded certified

1211
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,339
signing key and actually as of August of

1212
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,319
last year Sony is producing a camera

1213
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:50,880
with this technology

1214
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,040
and so every time one of these cameras

1215
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,020
takes a photo the location and time

1216
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,579
stamp of the photo would get recorded

1217
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,319
and then all that information would be

1218
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,680
signed by the signing key and then if

1219
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,680
you see uh this photo in your browser in

1220
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,720
a news article you would be able to the

1221
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,280
browser would be able to verify the

1222
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,079
metadata of this photo by simply

1223
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,700
verifying the camera signature

1224
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:15,240
sorry

1225
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,579
so for the purposes of this talk we're

1226
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,260
going to assume that you can't extract

1227
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,359
the embedding key from the camera and

1228
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,099
I'm going to focus on a different area

1229
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,140
for improvement that we see in the c2pa

1230
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,240
but if you're curious to learn a little

1231
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,980
bit more about potential risks and

1232
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,720
associated with using the standard you

1233
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,599
can refer to this talk

1234
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,040
so the issue that I'm going to talk

1235
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,980
about today with regards to the CPA is

1236
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,319
how to handle post-processing now

1237
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,660
post-processing basically refers to any

1238
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,059
edits made to the photo between when it

1239
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,859
is taken and what it is published in a

1240
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:49,260
news article online and usually at

1241
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,540
minimum photos are downsized from their

1242
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,940
original size so that users don't have

1243
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,160
to download these gigantic photo files

1244
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,780
and just to give you an idea of size

1245
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,059
that Sony camera that I mentioned on the

1246
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:01,500
previous Slide the pictures that it

1247
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,540
takes are about 30 megapixels which

1248
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,640
would be about 90 megabytes and they

1249
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,380
might be resized to something like eight

1250
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,119
megabytes and that's just a number we

1251
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,619
got from looking at articles on the New

1252
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,380
York Times in addition to downsizing

1253
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,240
there are several other edits that may

1254
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,280
occur to a photo before it is actually

1255
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,859
published the Associated Press actually

1256
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,380
has a list online of what they call

1257
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,300
allowable edits so these are things that

1258
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,460
basically do not change the fundamental

1259
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,319
character of the photo and they include

1260
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,720
edits like converting to grayscale and

1261
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,400
cropping and other minor coloration

1262
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,280
edits and the reason why post processing

1263
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,900
kind of puts a little bit of A Wrinkle

1264
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,579
In the scheme that it described on the

1265
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,280
previous slide is that in order to

1266
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,260
verify a signature you need access to

1267
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,000
the thing that was signed but if the

1268
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,500
browser is only viewing this

1269
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,420
post-process photo then it obviously has

1270
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,700
no way of verifying the camera signature

1271
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,980
on the original photo

1272
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,800
and so the c2pa does have a proposed

1273
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,940
mechanism for dealing with this

1274
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,740
essentially it involves getting a

1275
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,740
trusted third party to sign attestations

1276
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,780
of which edits have taken place but

1277
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,280
having a trusted third party is not

1278
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,220
really ideal it introduces

1279
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,260
um this point of failure and so it'd be

1280
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,839
nice if we could somehow have proof of

1281
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:14,520
which edits have been have taken place

1282
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,880
without this trusted third party

1283
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,220
and hopefully this should be no surprise

1284
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,380
given the title of this talk but what we

1285
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,940
are proposing instead of this trusted

1286
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,119
third party is the use of ZK snarks and

1287
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,619
I'll just give a quick little refresher

1288
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,020
on ZK snarks so you can think of them as

1289
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,300
efficiently verifiable statements about

1290
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,980
a secret Witness

1291
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,079
so basically how this works is we have

1292
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,180
approver and a verifier and they both

1293
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,920
have access to some kind of public

1294
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,480
information which we call the public

1295
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,420
statement and the prover has access to a

1296
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,040
secret witness that the verifier does

1297
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,960
not have access to and essentially

1298
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,400
what's going to happen is the prover

1299
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,800
tells the verifier hey verifier I claim

1300
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,359
something is true about my secret

1301
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:56,339
witness and I'm going to give you this

1302
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:59,099
proof pie to prove it and the verifier

1303
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:00,540
says thank you I'm going to take this

1304
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,579
proof pie and I will check it and if the

1305
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:04,619
verifiers check passes then they will be

1306
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:05,940
convinced that the prover's claim is

1307
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,800
true and if it fails then they will not

1308
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,359
be convinced that the previous claim is

1309
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,380
true

1310
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,599
and ZK snarks have five very important

1311
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,640
properties so the first is that they are

1312
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,380
complete and this means that if the

1313
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,020
prover's claim is true then the

1314
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,760
verifiers check will pass with very high

1315
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,040
probability they are also sound which

1316
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,420
means that if the prover's claim is

1317
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,160
false then the verifiers check will pass

1318
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,619
with very low probability they are

1319
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,359
non-interactive which means that the

1320
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,160
prover and the verifier aren't sending a

1321
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,720
bunch of messages back and forth the

1322
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,160
prover is just sending this one message

1323
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,099
pi and any verifier can check it

1324
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,200
there are also zero knowledge which

1325
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,819
means that the only thing that the

1326
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:43,260
verifier is learning about the secret

1327
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,480
witness is whatever is implied by the

1328
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,000
claim and they're also succinct which

1329
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,819
means that the verifiers check can be

1330
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:53,220
performed efficiently

1331
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,680
okay so how does this apply to our photo

1332
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,859
situation so basically uh instead of

1333
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:00,359
approver and a verifier we can think

1334
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:01,740
about this in terms of the news

1335
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,980
organization and the web browser and

1336
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,780
what the news organization is basically

1337
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,940
trying to convince the web browser of is

1338
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,980
that all of the photos in the article

1339
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,680
which again are post-process photos so

1340
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,480
trying to convince the verifier that all

1341
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,819
post-process photos were taken when and

1342
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:20,220
where the article claims they were taken

1343
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,780
so in terms of the public information

1344
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,059
that both the browser and the News

1345
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:26,640
organization have access to they both

1346
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,200
have access to these edited or

1347
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,380
post-processed photos as well as a set

1348
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,180
of operations which is basically going

1349
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,579
to be a subset of that list of allowable

1350
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:38,099
operations from the Associated Press and

1351
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:40,079
these are the operations that have been

1352
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,760
applied to the original photo to get

1353
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,460
this post-process public photo

1354
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,440
the secret witness is going to be the

1355
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,000
original photo as well as the camera

1356
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,700
signature on the original photo and then

1357
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,740
the news organization has to convince

1358
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,900
the web browser of three things first

1359
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,660
that they have a an original photo with

1360
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,300
a valid signature second that if you

1361
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,540
apply this set of operations Ops to the

1362
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,819
uh the original photo you will get the

1363
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:08,579
public edited photo and then third that

1364
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,980
the metadata of the edited photo is

1365
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,420
equal to the metadata of the original

1366
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,099
photo

1367
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,079
and the cool thing here is that this

1368
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,880
system that I've just described is using

1369
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,559
all five of those properties of ZK

1370
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:21,480
snarks that I just discussed

1371
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,460
so the completeness and soundness means

1372
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,260
that the verifier does not need to trust

1373
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,300
the prover and that gets rid of that

1374
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,280
trusted third-party constraint in the

1375
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,020
c2pa

1376
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,819
the non-interactivity is important

1377
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:34,619
because if these proofs were interactive

1378
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:35,940
that would mean that the news

1379
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,380
organization would have to exchange

1380
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,780
messages with every browser that viewed

1381
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,460
the article which is obviously not ideal

1382
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,940
and wouldn't make this a feasible system

1383
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,640
the zero knowledge property is useful if

1384
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,319
we're applying an operation to the

1385
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:50,880
original photo such as cropping where

1386
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,799
maybe we don't want the web browser to

1387
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,900
know what was cropped out of the photo

1388
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,240
and the succinctness is useful uh

1389
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,180
because that means that the check that

1390
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,099
the web browser performs on the proof is

1391
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,299
efficient which means that we can

1392
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:05,099
reasonably expect these browsers to

1393
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:08,180
actually perform these checks

1394
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,859
okay so in 2016 navane schroemer

1395
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:12,960
published a paper called photo proof

1396
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,540
which was basically uh they showed that

1397
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,119
you could create zero knowledge proofs

1398
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,059
for photo edits and this was really cool

1399
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,980
because it was a great proof of concept

1400
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,079
but unfortunately it took them a few

1401
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,760
minutes to create these proofs for

1402
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,599
images of about 128 by 128 pixels and if

1403
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,220
you'll recall that Sony camera that I

1404
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,319
mentioned at the beginning it has it

1405
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,480
produces pictures of about 30 megapixels

1406
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,400
which is obviously several orders of

1407
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,940
magnitude larger than 128 by 128. so

1408
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,740
while this was really cool the

1409
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,480
technology wasn't quite there yet to

1410
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,980
make these proofs for realistically

1411
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,720
sized images in a reasonable amount of

1412
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,220
time

1413
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,839
the great news is that since then

1414
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,760
there's been an explosion in ZK snark

1415
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,559
technology these are just some of the

1416
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,359
many tools available to developers now

1417
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,880
and basically what this means is that we

1418
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,500
now are able to create these kinds of

1419
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,839
proofs for realistically sized images in

1420
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,859
a reasonable amount of time

1421
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,339
oh

1422
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:09,440
okay

1423
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,660
so uh we created editing proof

1424
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,400
generation programs for three different

1425
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,920
types of edits uh resizing cropping and

1426
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,660
grayscale which are all from the

1427
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,579
Associated Press a list of allowable

1428
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,640
edits and we performed experiments for

1429
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,740
images of about 30 megapixels which is

1430
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,960
again the size of pictures produced by

1431
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,480
that Sony camera and we wrote these

1432
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,160
programs using sercom which is one of

1433
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,839
the tools I listed on the previous slide

1434
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,000
which is basically a general purpose

1435
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,220
zero knowledge programming language

1436
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,220
and when we talk about timing for these

1437
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,480
proofs we want to talk about two

1438
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,400
different elements of timing first is

1439
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,960
how long it takes to generate the proof

1440
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,400
and second is how long it takes to

1441
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,500
verify the proof and the kind of main

1442
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,240
difference between those two elements is

1443
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,980
that we only have to generate these

1444
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,079
proofs once per image and that is

1445
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:56,460
performed by the news organization

1446
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,579
whereas every browser that accesses news

1447
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,319
articles will have to verify these

1448
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,599
proofs so while proof generation needs

1449
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,579
to be fast proof verification needs to

1450
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,960
be very fast

1451
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,079
and what we see is that proof generation

1452
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,299
which for surcom consists of generating

1453
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,160
the proof as well as also doing some

1454
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,440
kind of witness generation that takes a

1455
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,760
few minutes which again is reasonable

1456
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,740
because this only has to be done once

1457
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,799
per image and proof verification is very

1458
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,079
fast again due to the succinctness of ZK

1459
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,579
snarks and it only takes about two

1460
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,040
milliseconds

1461
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,780
okay so if we go back to the three

1462
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,720
things that the news organization needs

1463
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,540
to prove to the web browser I've talked

1464
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,160
about the Second Step which is proving

1465
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,559
that the post-process photo is the

1466
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,299
results of applying certain edits to an

1467
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,940
original photo the third bullet isn't as

1468
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,099
interesting uh I haven't talked about

1469
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:48,900
this first bullet which is

1470
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,520
proving that we have a valid signature

1471
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,500
on the original photo and unfortunately

1472
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,619
this turns out to be the bottleneck

1473
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:58,260
so what we want to do is we want to show

1474
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,059
we want to prove that we have a hash of

1475
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:01,559
the original photo and then that we have

1476
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:04,319
a signature on this hash and ideally we

1477
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,119
would do this for a standard hash like

1478
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,559
sha-256 unfortunately it takes a lot of

1479
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,020
time to produce this kind of proof for

1480
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,200
30 megapixel image using shot 256 and

1481
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,299
the kind of intuition as to why is that

1482
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,099
it takes a long time to generate proofs

1483
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,680
for non-linear constraints and shot 256

1484
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,980
has a lot of non-linear operations

1485
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,260
now there are hash functions that are

1486
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,760
designed specifically to be snark

1487
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,980
friendly one of them is Poseidon and so

1488
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,420
you might think that we could just use

1489
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,720
Poseidon for our 30 megapixel image but

1490
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,940
this also turns out to be too slow and

1491
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,920
not practically feasible

1492
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,559
and so what we end up doing is we take a

1493
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,900
lattice hash of our original image and

1494
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,880
then we take a Poseidon hash of the

1495
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,400
lattice hash and

1496
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,200
this ends up working

1497
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,000
and we think that this construction is

1498
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,740
kind of independently interesting as a

1499
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,540
way to Hash really large things within

1500
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,099
snarks

1501
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:00,960
okay so I'm just gonna go into a little

1502
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,280
bit more detail about this hash

1503
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,319
construction so essentially we're

1504
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,180
applying a standard lattice hash to the

1505
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,200
original image and how this works is we

1506
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,180
create a which is a random Matrix over a

1507
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,760
finite field and then we represent the

1508
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,240
original photo as a lone Norm Vector in

1509
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,920
this field so this is the thing that is

1510
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,079
being hashed and then we multiply these

1511
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,000
two things together and this gives us

1512
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,280
our lattice hash and this is still

1513
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,780
pretty large so what we do is we just

1514
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,339
run this through Poseidon and that gives

1515
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,559
us our eventual hash now the intuition

1516
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,780
as to why this is faster than something

1517
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,299
like shot 256 is this matrix

1518
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:37,859
multiplication in the beginning is

1519
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:39,059
basically just a bunch of linear

1520
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,700
constraints and it's much faster for us

1521
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,260
to generate a proof for linear

1522
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,660
constraints than non-linear constraints

1523
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,579
the kind of trade-off that we have in

1524
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,640
doing this is that this hash function is

1525
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,859
only Collision resistant assuming sis

1526
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:55,380
and so in addition to proving that we

1527
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,180
know this pre-image that hashes to this

1528
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,940
final hash we also have to prove that

1529
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,460
this pre-image is low Norm

1530
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,380
so how do we prove something is low Norm

1531
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,420
uh there's a pretty cute little trick

1532
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,880
that we do uh essentially proving that

1533
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,380
something is low Norm is proving that

1534
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,839
all the elements are between zero and

1535
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:14,220
this limit r

1536
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,720
and so I'll have this picture on the

1537
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,180
side illustrating what I'm talking about

1538
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:20,099
uh but so we have our R we have our X

1539
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:21,540
which we're trying to prove is low norm

1540
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,880
and then we create another Vector Y

1541
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,579
which is all of the values from 0 to R

1542
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:27,780
minus one

1543
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,700
and then we create a third Vector Z

1544
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,799
which is the sorted concatenation of X

1545
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:34,319
and Y so first we concatenate X and Y

1546
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,720
and then we sort it and now that we have

1547
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,440
Z we have to prove uh two things one is

1548
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,599
that Z is a permutation the values in X

1549
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,960
and Y and two that the differences

1550
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,119
between consecutive values and z are

1551
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,040
zero and one and intuitively what this

1552
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,900
proves is that the values of X are

1553
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,040
contained in y

1554
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,359
okay so this is a graph showing our

1555
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,299
timing results for generating a proof

1556
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:01,740
with just the Poseidon hash versus

1557
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,780
generating a proof with the Poseidon

1558
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,880
plus lattice has construction and you'll

1559
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,520
see that for smaller image sizes it is

1560
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,799
more efficient to just use the Poseidon

1561
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,140
hash but for more realistic image sizes

1562
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,299
specifically those last two dots there's

1563
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:17,819
that's that magic 30 megapixels number

1564
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:20,220
uh you'll see that the Poseidon plus

1565
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,260
lattice hash construction is much faster

1566
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,780
and actually we couldn't even get the

1567
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,559
Poseidon hash proof to actually finish

1568
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,140
we ran out of memory so that's a

1569
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,740
projected point

1570
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,020
so in conclusion I think kind of the big

1571
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,180
picture takeaway from this talk is that

1572
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,819
there's been a lot of improvement in ZK

1573
01:05:41,819 --> 01:05:43,559
snark technology and this has mainly

1574
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,720
been driven by applications for the

1575
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,700
blockchain but there are also a lot of

1576
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,260
other really cool applications that we

1577
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,900
can use DK snarks for and we've seen a

1578
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,400
bunch of others and other talks in this

1579
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,160
conference in particular in this talk we

1580
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,500
show that we can create a photo editing

1581
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,599
proofs for realistically sized photos in

1582
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,640
a reasonable amount of time and a kind

1583
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,520
of obvious application of this is for

1584
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,040
image authenticity in the c2pa

1585
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,220
and one interesting open problem is in

1586
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,660
this talk I've only really talked about

1587
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,660
photos but there is also misinformation

1588
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:18,180
in terms of videos and so one thing to

1589
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,500
think about is how would we go about

1590
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,059
creating these kinds of proofs for

1591
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:22,079
videos

1592
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,100
and that's it thank you

1593
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:33,359
[Applause]

1594
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,220
thank you very much I see a lot of

1595
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,500
questions so please on the right hand

1596
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,760
side go ahead

1597
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,220
um the first thing I came to my mind was

1598
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,559
that c2pa is going to be the same

1599
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:47,400
problem of sgx problem with having to

1600
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,980
rotate your keys and so on uh I already

1601
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,720
smell that and some maybe talks next

1602
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,819
year about that

1603
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:56,940
um the so your concern with chapter 56

1604
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,099
was it was linear have you considered

1605
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,240
using

1606
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,579
um a paralyzable function like I don't

1607
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:04,680
know kangaroo 12.

1608
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,140
do not consider that but that would be

1609
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,180
definitely another option to look into

1610
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,799
yeah

1611
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,559
because kangaroo 12 like hash blocks by

1612
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:16,079
blocks of 8 000 bytes and so you can

1613
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,660
literally paralyze that over 2566 core

1614
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,220
or whatever polarization you can so

1615
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,140
that's a very nice trick that you could

1616
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,819
have maybe considered yeah no I think

1617
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:25,319
that sounds very interesting and I think

1618
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:27,960
there's obviously much more to be done

1619
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,180
and making this even faster is obviously

1620
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:34,819
uh a good thing thank you thanks

1621
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:37,920
you have a question about the threat

1622
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,319
model so I'm wondering if you try to

1623
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,960
keep the identity of the camera private

1624
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,640
or not and if you do what do you protect

1625
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,460
against a physical component of a single

1626
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,380
camera that can then be used to provide

1627
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,960
a forgeries with the guarantees have

1628
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,180
never been good sorry I missed the word

1629
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,980
you said uh trying to keep what private

1630
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,420
in the game I don't think you have the

1631
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,119
camera the camera is it private or not

1632
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,760
and if it is all to protect against

1633
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,700
physical compromise of One camera yeah I

1634
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,619
I think in our threat model it's not

1635
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:09,059
private

1636
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,799
um yeah thanks

1637
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,100
so Suppose there is an added picture and

1638
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,399
a proof and now I want to re-edit this

1639
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,120
picture so how do I generate the proof

1640
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,359
can I use the existing proof or I

1641
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,779
generate the proof from the beginning I

1642
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,899
think if I use the former the verifier

1643
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:36,540
needs to check two proofs and the

1644
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,859
verifying time will be doubled

1645
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:43,560
and I think if I use the latter the

1646
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,299
proof generation time will be larger so

1647
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,880
how how do I choose

1648
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,679
yeah so act

1649
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,739
or

1650
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,238
I think the proofs are designed that you

1651
01:08:57,238 --> 01:08:58,859
can kind of like stack them on top of

1652
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,238
one of another so I think it would

1653
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,979
actually be the second thing that you

1654
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,960
said where the proof generation time

1655
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,000
might double but again because it's only

1656
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,080
happening

1657
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,399
once per image it's not really a huge

1658
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:17,599
concern okay so I get it yeah

1659
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,040
um thank you very much for the talk

1660
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,839
um so I was curious uh how have you

1661
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:22,679
thought have you given any thought to

1662
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:24,238
handling like semantic preserving edits

1663
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,399
so you can imagine a case where you're

1664
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,899
because the original image is in the

1665
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:28,859
witness

1666
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,660
um I give you a legitimate edit but the

1667
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,460
edit modifies the semantics of the

1668
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,899
picture to imply something different

1669
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:36,000
than the original photo antennas and so

1670
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,560
how would you handle a case like that

1671
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,080
yeah so the thing about these proofs is

1672
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,198
that the operations are public and so if

1673
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:44,520
you're making an edit that changes the

1674
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,140
semantics of the photo then you would be

1675
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,819
able to see that that is the edit that

1676
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,359
has been made and so like you as a the

1677
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,819
browser as a verifier could flag that

1678
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,980
and be like well this is not changing

1679
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,960
sorry this is changing the fundamental

1680
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,880
nature of the photo so presuming the

1681
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,560
original user has the original picture

1682
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,120
available to them

1683
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,940
well no because the the edits that are

1684
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,620
made to the photo are part of the public

1685
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,199
statement so if you make some kind of I

1686
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:11,820
guess are you saying

1687
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,800
it's

1688
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,940
I guess you're talking about a case

1689
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,860
where it's it seems like an instant edit

1690
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,140
but it's changing the I see yeah I'll

1691
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,820
follow up afterwards yeah yeah thank you

1692
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,800
yeah so unfortunately we don't have time

1693
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,840
anymore so we need to take these

1694
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,699
questions offline and go to the next

1695
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:27,700
talk thank you very much

1696
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:37,500
[Applause]

1697
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,100
so the next talk is uh by Joshua Baron

1698
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,380
and he's going to speak about I was told

1699
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:48,300
there there would be

1700
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,460
a blockchain five years of real world

1701
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,739
crypto at Starbucks hi everyone I'm Josh

1702
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:55,199
I'm a program manager at DARPA so DARPA

1703
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,420
is a funding agency uh the D and DARPA

1704
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,620
stands for defense word the Department

1705
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,480
of Defense is kind of high-risk higher

1706
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,219
reward research agency we've been

1707
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:03,900
involved in cryptographic research for

1708
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,360
the last 10 years

1709
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,620
I've had the privilege of being at DARPA

1710
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,199
for a bit over five years and so really

1711
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,699
um this talk is going to be a little

1712
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:13,620
different it's not uh it's going to be

1713
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,199
incredibly scattered so literally every

1714
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,820
slide is going to be at least one new

1715
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,159
idea and probably more than one so it'll

1716
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,840
be a journey that we will all be on

1717
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,580
together and I put the word blockchain

1718
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,500
in there because I thought I would be

1719
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,300
funny but the truth is is that we I have

1720
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,980
done nothing blockchain over the last

1721
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,300
five years

1722
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,540
um with one except

1723
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,280
okay cool I'm figuring this out with one

1724
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,560
exception we did fund some work at a

1725
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,500
trail of bits looking at the underlying

1726
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,120
thinking through centralities and

1727
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,679
distributed Ledger Technologies because

1728
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,820
it turns out when you build a

1729
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,560
distributed system there are any number

1730
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,719
of ways in which it's not so distributed

1731
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,280
um and so there's impacts in that and I

1732
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,300
encourage you to read that report

1733
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,739
because it's pretty fun and interesting

1734
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,199
but again uh that is the entirety of

1735
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,460
blockchain we will be talking about

1736
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,300
today

1737
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,400
all right so um in the beginning there's

1738
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,080
a program called proceed uh which was

1739
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,580
doing fully homework encryption a very

1740
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,560
long time ago by a very long time I mean

1741
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,179
like 10 years ago

1742
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:08,640
um and uh we've been doing at DARPA a

1743
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,179
number of programs uh and by doing let

1744
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:13,860
me just step back again we're a funding

1745
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,420
agency so I want to be really clear

1746
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,640
everything I'm going to talk about uh I

1747
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,620
did I just paid for which is to say I

1748
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,820
took the government's money and paid for

1749
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,219
it so I did nothing I'm just presenting

1750
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:24,840
other people's ideas and pretending that

1751
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,880
I'm cool so that's that's literally like

1752
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,960
what we're what we're going to be doing

1753
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,760
here okay so um there are a bunch of

1754
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,560
programs I'm not going to go over all

1755
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,300
them in the interest of time

1756
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,420
um but today uh we'll see I'm going to

1757
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,699
try to hit uh very briefly uh four

1758
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:40,260
different uh programs Each of which

1759
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,239
again I'm really not going to focus on

1760
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,679
kind of how we did it and I'm going to

1761
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,500
more focus on what we did okay so

1762
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,060
there's probably going to be well anyhow

1763
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,580
we'll let's let's get going so um

1764
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,900
Brandeis is a program that actually

1765
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,020
ended uh like 18 months ago two years

1766
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,159
ago a while

1767
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,659
um but it still takes time to actually

1768
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,540
release code and so one thing that just

1769
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,320
came out last August was a program a

1770
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,280
open source Android app called coffee

1771
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,199
break and if it's you and up to 10

1772
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:13,260
friends want to find a place to for

1773
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,760
coffee which is to say you want to find

1774
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,739
a noisy and noisy is important here

1775
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:18,000
because if it's not noisy you can kind

1776
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,040
of geolocate everyone else a noisy

1777
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,860
median point you can do a garbled

1778
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,040
circuit NPC and so in other words it is

1779
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,739
comms Channel agnostic we use rabbitmq

1780
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,600
but it doesn't really matter you so

1781
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,280
you're actually doing full multi-party

1782
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,199
computation on Android phones it takes a

1783
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,580
couple of minutes in the 10-party case

1784
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,500
and you can find a place to meet up

1785
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,420
what's really fun is that if you think

1786
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,400
of what proceed was which was fhe it was

1787
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,659
this whole like you know everything goes

1788
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:43,980
up to the cloud this is the total

1789
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,320
opposite this is doing full up straight

1790
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,420
you know garbled circuit NPC 10 parties

1791
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,340
where all the computation is actually

1792
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,320
happening on phones there's no offloaded

1793
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,239
computation into the cloud so if you

1794
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,040
think that's fun again the software is

1795
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,860
up on GitHub and uh yeah

1796
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:01,560
all right moving on uh we're going to

1797
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,000
talk a little bit about a program that

1798
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,820
started uh three-ish years ago maybe a

1799
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,560
little less called Everything a dart

1800
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,000
bass to have a funny name that's like

1801
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,520
how we talk so it had to be Civ which

1802
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,840
stands for something and I actually had

1803
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,280
to look up what it stood for even though

1804
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,679
I created it like three years ago and so

1805
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:18,480
it stands for that thing but we call it

1806
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,620
Civ and so really it's this idea of um

1807
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,540
creating mathematically verifiable

1808
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,219
public statements derived from hidden

1809
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,080
yet sensitive information in order to

1810
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,060
publicly yet securely communicate about

1811
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,760
DOD capabilities really we're not going

1812
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,199
to talk about the dod stuff right now

1813
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:35,760
because it's kind of less of interest to

1814
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,260
this room and we're going to talk much

1815
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,239
more about uh candidly what we've been

1816
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:41,280
mainly focusing on which is uh like

1817
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,480
everything else that we've been trying

1818
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,380
to do and so uh

1819
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,120
it would not surprise you to know that

1820
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,739
there is a lot of research happening

1821
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:51,120
right now in the zero knowledge space

1822
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,640
having to do with cryptocurrencies and a

1823
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:54,600
lot of that are there for kind of

1824
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,179
statements about paying for things

1825
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:59,280
um I I'm not so much interested in zero

1826
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,620
knowledge about paying for things I'm

1827
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,060
interested in zero knowledge about real

1828
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,739
really any number of other things and so

1829
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:06,239
the way we actually structured our

1830
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,460
program was um they're kind of there's

1831
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,659
the kind of standard thing of how do we

1832
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:11,340
build really fast zero knowledge but

1833
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,500
then the other is how do I take like

1834
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,780
General statements and then actually

1835
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,280
turn them into intermediate

1836
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,420
representations that are friendly for

1837
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,400
zero knowledge proofs and then do zero

1838
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,020
knowledge proofs the other thing that's

1839
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,540
kind of a major differentiator for what

1840
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,760
we're doing versus others we're not as

1841
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,500
focused in the non-in interactivity

1842
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,360
though we do do non-interactive work and

1843
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,739
we're definitely not as focused on the

1844
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:33,600
succinctness and the reason we're less

1845
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,480
focused on on succinctness is because in

1846
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,040
many cases as we'll see our proof

1847
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,719
statements are massive like massive

1848
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:41,940
massive um and so anything that's super

1849
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,620
linear we just take a massive hit and

1850
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,360
everything dies and we're going to get

1851
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,739
into kind of what that what that means

1852
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:49,980
okay we are funding a ton of people

1853
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,580
um

1854
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,620
uh U.S focused but we're definitely

1855
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,120
funding folks that are not only in the

1856
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,860
United States people often think that

1857
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,719
DARPA only funds people in the US and

1858
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,940
that's 100 not true we love working with

1859
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,760
foreign companies and people and uh yeah

1860
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,500
we're very friendly over here at DARPA

1861
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:08,040
uh all right uh next slide uh I don't

1862
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,179
know why I just said next when I can

1863
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:10,260
click through next

1864
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,120
um so um

1865
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,679
force a habit

1866
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,679
um so uh the kind of three types of

1867
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:18,060
actually let me just go back to you just

1868
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,440
real quick um here's the thing to

1869
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,760
understand on the right I think it was

1870
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,159
like the um like the car it's building

1871
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,719
the really fast car it can do a lot of

1872
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,340
things but like what can it do well it

1873
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,719
can do whatever we build statements for

1874
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:29,520
right so this is kind of awesome because

1875
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,900
I can build things that like make really

1876
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,940
fast DK proofs but really what I care

1877
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,739
about honestly is how do I make cool ZK

1878
01:16:34,739 --> 01:16:36,840
statements right in an efficiency case

1879
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,820
statements okay so that's what we did we

1880
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,739
funded like six different teams I can

1881
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,300
count yep six

1882
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,920
um to do for different things along

1883
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,020
three different kind of areas one is in

1884
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,760
uh statements about software one

1885
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,980
statements about um computation and then

1886
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,960
one's socio-technical so software will

1887
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,219
literally be um proofs of like

1888
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:54,719
vulnerability and security and stuff

1889
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,640
like that and exploitability computation

1890
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,500
is the kind of more standard zero

1891
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,400
knowledge you know verifiable

1892
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,980
computation type stuff and then

1893
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,280
socio-technical uh we will see

1894
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,820
so

1895
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,320
um why do we need giant zero knowledge

1896
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,860
uh statements uh well uh one of the

1897
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,000
things that we were kind of interested

1898
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,679
in just stepping back was the original

1899
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,420
snarks paper was that you know snarks

1900
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,640
for C right and so uh when I saw that

1901
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,659
initially it was like well that's really

1902
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:20,580
interesting we're taking the C code and

1903
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,500
compiling it down into a thing that we

1904
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,239
can do ZK proofs on

1905
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,520
um can we do ZK proofs of um like

1906
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,100
exploitability of the C code right and

1907
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,659
the answer at the time was like kind of

1908
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,280
sort of not really and the reason is

1909
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,640
because it uh how you compile down

1910
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,620
matters and often if you're just

1911
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,300
compiling for how the C code Works

1912
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,860
you're missing critical details of the

1913
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,239
underlying system where the

1914
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,640
vulnerabilities live right so like as a

1915
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,199
straw person like if you just have Str

1916
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:47,940
copy in the code and your proof is there

1917
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:49,560
exists a bad you know piece of code in

1918
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,820
there like that's rather straightforward

1919
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,020
but if you want to talk about like

1920
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,699
memory corruption or if you want to even

1921
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:56,040
get down into the underlying Isa right

1922
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,300
and actually say like something is

1923
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,620
happening in the ascent like as when you

1924
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,300
compile down to assembly it's very very

1925
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,980
different things and as a result your

1926
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,360
statements get massive because your

1927
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,040
underlying representation has to

1928
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,480
actually cover right all of that

1929
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,760
abstraction right I thought well not

1930
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,380
yeah Okay cool so uh we're actually

1931
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,940
doing it in two different ways

1932
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,620
um we actually took the msp430

1933
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,300
microcontroller this is trailer bits

1934
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,219
work and they actually took a um like

1935
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:18,540
you capture the flag and they did zero

1936
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,920
knowledge proofs of exploitability for

1937
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,199
all those capture the flags

1938
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,179
um their next uh trick is going to do an

1939
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,400
actual reduced Isa version of x86 and

1940
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,380
I'll talk about more of that later

1941
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,380
um and again actually they're not like

1942
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,580
msp430 is like this tiny thing so like

1943
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,260
it doesn't blow up too much

1944
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,199
um but uh then for our next uh that's uh

1945
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,120
what trailer bits is doing galwa is more

1946
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,159
looked at at kind of C code and program

1947
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:44,460
traces and so um I think yeah so this is

1948
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,020
going to be a usenix uh the previous

1949
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,580
work that I just mentioned at a popets

1950
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:50,699
uh on the msp430 the tiny 86 stuff isn't

1951
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:51,719
out yet

1952
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:53,340
um this stuff I'm about to talk about is

1953
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,500
it usenix and uh it's actually a zero

1954
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,300
knowledge proof of hard bleed so I could

1955
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,040
take the open SSL code and show that

1956
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,380
there was a buffer uh there's a memory

1957
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,360
corruption issue right now just to be

1958
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,400
clear right this is also the subtlety

1959
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,679
um the statement about the exploit

1960
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,140
matters right so like as an example it's

1961
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,820
extremely difficult to capture like row

1962
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,380
Hammer because then to do that I have to

1963
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,659
actually like you know but if I want to

1964
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:17,580
talk about just like there exists memory

1965
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,440
corruption in like Heartbleed versus

1966
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,820
like this line of code has a

1967
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,199
vulnerability which would obviously be a

1968
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:25,560
much smaller statement right so um look

1969
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,760
at the multiplication gate that's in

1970
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,679
millions so that would be 17 billion

1971
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:29,820
Gates

1972
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:33,300
okay that is large I think where are we

1973
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,040
in Z cash right now it's in the tens of

1974
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,600
millions is the current size of that

1975
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,699
circuit

1976
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:40,920
yeah it's cool

1977
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,840
luckily we have really fast zero

1978
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,920
knowledge

1979
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,620
um so uh our Gala team um based off of

1980
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,360
this is uh they published the original

1981
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,219
work in crypto but this is a faster

1982
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,360
version of it

1983
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,340
um we are doing uh zero knowledge proofs

1984
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,920
on AES computations that are only 100x

1985
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,080
slower than the software implementations

1986
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,300
of AES not Hardware that would be really

1987
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,739
cool but software

1988
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,199
um so we're at 4.5 nanoseconds per and

1989
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,580
gate

1990
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,820
for that tiny 86 stuff we're at 3.0

1991
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,620
nanoseconds per and gate which actually

1992
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,140
is about a 15.25 kilohertz zero

1993
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,140
knowledge processor for 1086. right so

1994
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,780
that's not great but that's getting kind

1995
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,360
of interesting and that's like sick fast

1996
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,620
for what it's worth

1997
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,060
um suppose you didn't want to do that

1998
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,920
like crazy standoffish stuff but you

1999
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,179
wanted to do something that literally

2000
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:29,280
just lived in the browser

2001
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,560
um or one of our teams lahero actually

2002
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,420
has work where you can actually do full

2003
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,679
up zero knowledge proofs and

2004
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:36,480
verification in the browser via like

2005
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,880
wasm code it's extremely again even

2006
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,380
there we're talking about microseconds

2007
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,540
per per gate so it's not like it's

2008
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,719
slower but it's not it's not slow and in

2009
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,000
fact uh that will be please watch out

2010
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,500
for that work as it gets published it's

2011
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,060
really interesting and you can do a lot

2012
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,219
of really interesting things in that in

2013
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:57,960
that work okay next I said next again

2014
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,179
um Sue um

2015
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,400
oh as time's gonna be fun

2016
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,440
um break break totally different thing

2017
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,600
um we also care about Society

2018
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,360
um no so uh one of the really exciting

2019
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,100
things um you know cool we can get into

2020
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,440
the really nitty-gritty uh on um you

2021
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,480
know like no kidding like really really

2022
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,460
hardcore stuff in terms of how we think

2023
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,600
about

2024
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,340
um computer systems right and how do we

2025
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,540
how do we create these abstract models

2026
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,000
of computer systems um but also

2027
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,260
um how do you user and all those things

2028
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,179
that are relevant for like polity right

2029
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,440
and so one of the things I'm really

2030
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,820
proud of is that they're in the recent

2031
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,860
computer science uh Symposium on

2032
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,239
computer science and law I think it was

2033
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:35,400
like a quarter to a third of all the

2034
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,140
talks were funded by us uh and again

2035
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,520
that's just really awesome and that's a

2036
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,679
real credit to the team at a bu and MIT

2037
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:43,620
that we're funding uh one talk uh one

2038
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,659
paper I wanted to highlight is um the

2039
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:47,880
Balsa nissenbaum Park paper that's about

2040
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,159
how cryptographic and it was really

2041
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,600
hinted at a couple of times over the

2042
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,340
last couple days the way that we

2043
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,199
cryptographers talk about trust is very

2044
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,060
very different than how like normals

2045
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,739
talk about trust

2046
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:01,800
um and so it would behoove us to

2047
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,199
understand what they want and not try to

2048
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:06,719
get them to do what we want right

2049
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,400
um and so just you know that's the thing

2050
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,860
to look at also we have papers in law

2051
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,840
journals which tickles me and is really

2052
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,060
really cool and who knows that might I

2053
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,040
think that could be um kind of fun all

2054
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,360
right next

2055
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:22,020
all right so to force a habit

2056
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,580
um last thing on the Zero knowledge side

2057
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,420
and then we're going to do something

2058
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,739
completely different

2059
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:26,940
um I'm assuming I can go five minutes

2060
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,219
past the hour and if I can't uh this

2061
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:32,340
looks gonna get sporting uh so

2062
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,159
um this is an interesting proof on uh it

2063
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,380
turns out in Estonia to get a subsidy

2064
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,600
your car has to like spend a substantial

2065
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,460
like a very specific amount of time like

2066
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,960
in the Australian on the Estonian

2067
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,659
roadways right now uh I don't want to

2068
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:46,800
have to tell you everywhere where I

2069
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,960
drove for like the obvious reasons right

2070
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,520
um but can I do a zero knowledge proof

2071
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,900
based off of some like basic Raspberry

2072
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,659
Pi thing uh Hardware like dongle that

2073
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:55,800
actually shows that I've done that

2074
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,420
without revealing anything right so in

2075
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,739
other words I have done the requisite

2076
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:00,900
driving but I haven't but I'm not going

2077
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,340
to tell you actually where I drove so

2078
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,080
they actually already built this and

2079
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,760
it's sitting up again one of the cool

2080
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,900
Parts one of the things I love about

2081
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,179
DARPA was that and the way that we do

2082
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:10,560
this work is that this was done by

2083
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,600
cybernetica out of Estonia but the ZK

2084
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,699
technology was actually done by galwa

2085
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:15,659
and so they're actually like working

2086
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,820
together on this uh if you have this is

2087
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,440
not published this like super super new

2088
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,060
stuff like this is a picture from like a

2089
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,560
week or two ago if you have any

2090
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,300
questions Dan bogdanoff at cybernetica

2091
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,219
or just talk to me um I think this has a

2092
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:27,719
lot of implications just generally for

2093
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:29,400
how we think about

2094
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,360
um

2095
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,120
following people and and not trying to

2096
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,520
like actually reveal too much about like

2097
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,659
things that might have to do with like

2098
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:39,360
geolocation specific uh statements

2099
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,800
um they're also like a flip side of that

2100
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,300
obviously but we'll talk about that

2101
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,440
another time

2102
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,239
Now for Something Completely Different

2103
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:46,380
um we're going to talk about Anonymous

2104
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,900
communication okay

2105
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,699
um Tory is great

2106
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:52,679
um tour is incredibly distributed um

2107
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,179
tour is so distributed it has to

2108
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:55,560
announce where it lives because it

2109
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,120
announces where it lives it's targetable

2110
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,980
so the question is can I do less than

2111
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:02,520
Tor and only do messaging and so maybe

2112
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,900
if I do that and then I build a

2113
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,880
distributed system I'm not so targetable

2114
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,260
and so the kind of two things I have to

2115
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,480
do are MPC based message passing and

2116
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,640
hidden Communications that's a very very

2117
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,080
high level and I can talk a lot more

2118
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,460
about it but I'm not going to because of

2119
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,620
time uh so basically there are three

2120
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:17,880
parts we have two teams doing

2121
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,400
cryptography uh stealth and SRI we have

2122
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,780
four teams doing hidden Communications

2123
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:25,980
uh that's a Georgetown NRL tour Str SRI

2124
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:28,199
Princeton Chicago and

2125
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:31,380
gawa and then uh some folks doing

2126
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,260
integration we work very heavily we do

2127
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,120
work with DOD but frankly primarily we

2128
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,500
work with democracy rights and labor in

2129
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,659
the US Agency for Global media because

2130
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,460
uh this entire program is completely

2131
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,320
open source and the goal is to release

2132
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,580
all the technologies that we've

2133
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,860
developed for people to use and also

2134
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,840
because uh there is no world in which

2135
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,340
you should trust closed Source DARPA

2136
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,140
code for anonymous communication

2137
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,900
uh so uh yeah

2138
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,219
all right so let's talk about some

2139
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:57,360
really cool things that we've done uh

2140
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,800
much of which has been published but not

2141
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,640
all

2142
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,980
um I'm gonna skip Raven Str is pretty

2143
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:05,219
wild um this is uh we are using we are

2144
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:07,679
embedding uh messages in the generation

2145
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,420
of images it's called semantic

2146
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,880
steganography because don't think of it

2147
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,800
as stag it's kind of misleading also

2148
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,480
semantic it's kind of misleading it's

2149
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,760
really an encoding basically the

2150
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,560
underlying message drives the encoding

2151
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,540
of the image right so the structure of

2152
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,360
the face is the message you can do that

2153
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,739
with Gans the challenges that Gans

2154
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:27,120
aren't invertible right so in other

2155
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,800
words you can encode but not decode so

2156
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,239
we can do both

2157
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,520
um it's like 50 kilobytes per message so

2158
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,900
it's like a crypto like think of think

2159
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,280
of it as like a crypto key per message

2160
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,620
and again we're not going to claim you

2161
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,820
would be able to tell that the message

2162
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,980
is stagged but we don't think you can

2163
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,260
show that it's um that there's a hidden

2164
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,000
message in it and the second one which

2165
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,100
gets real fun is called butt kiss I

2166
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,440
think this is a submission now

2167
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,080
um this is using at the time gpt2 to

2168
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,820
build out a statistical distribution of

2169
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,800
English where we can embed crypto Keys

2170
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,500
into English statements so they were

2171
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,380
actually embedding AES crypto Keys into

2172
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,440
um like the Twitter uh what's it called

2173
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,639
uh the Sci-Fi like stories so we can put

2174
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:09,960
like sci-fi stories that are actually

2175
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,219
crypto Keys

2176
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:14,219
um they are reasonably readable

2177
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:15,480
um though they don't entirely make sense

2178
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,239
which you know it's not can't you can't

2179
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,260
do everything

2180
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,060
um I will say just for for fun um

2181
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,580
testing on Twitter for reasons is harder

2182
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,900
um but there was this application called

2183
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,400
Macedon which we've been using for years

2184
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,100
uh and so the increased uh anyhow that

2185
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,020
was an opportunity that was fun there's

2186
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,280
only one other major social media

2187
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,139
platform that uses Mastodon

2188
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:36,060
um or that has used the Mastodon code

2189
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,159
base and we weren't going to use that

2190
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,719
one if people know what that one is all

2191
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:40,620
right next

2192
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,420
uh okay

2193
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,100
um

2194
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,420
I am not going to talk about this in the

2195
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:46,800
interest of time other than you should

2196
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,719
look at usenix 2021 for something called

2197
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,760
Balboa it achieves enormously High

2198
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,440
throughput

2199
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,920
um and um for hidden traffic and what it

2200
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,199
basically does is it um hot swaps

2201
01:26:58,199 --> 01:26:59,940
packets for specific services so we

2202
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:01,739
literally we don't try to pretend to be

2203
01:27:01,739 --> 01:27:04,500
anything we are the actual service

2204
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,659
itself and we just swap the underlying

2205
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,219
packet space and if you do it fast

2206
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:09,480
enough and just to be really clear

2207
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,460
because we're talking TCP you have to do

2208
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,980
it very very fast you can hide

2209
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,480
completely and so we've thrown like

2210
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,739
supervised machine learning at this

2211
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:19,440
thing and we still can't find it also

2212
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,460
fun fact

2213
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,900
um throwing machine learning at

2214
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,120
encrypted traffic flows will almost

2215
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,620
always fingerprint what the traffic is

2216
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,000
so just because it's encrypted doesn't

2217
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,080
mean you're actually hiding what you're

2218
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,239
doing and I'm hoping most people here

2219
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,420
know what that is true okay next

2220
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,100
um we're doing a bunch of work helping

2221
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,020
tour with obfus which is look like

2222
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:37,739
nothing

2223
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:38,400
um

2224
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,960
hard to talk too much I mean there's

2225
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,340
just not much more to say about that um

2226
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,540
they're doing really great work and we

2227
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,679
like what they're doing

2228
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,719
um the thing I'm really excited about is

2229
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:46,980
um there's a technology called domain

2230
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,000
fronting

2231
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,940
um which is uh basically you bounce

2232
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,920
traffic that you need to send off of

2233
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,020
common uh places that are available on

2234
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,460
the internet so I think cloud providers

2235
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,139
and then you bounce it off the cloud

2236
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,460
provider and then you're able to get to

2237
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,600
where you actually want to go and then

2238
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,800
the bad guys can't tell where you're

2239
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,480
going that works great when the cloud

2240
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,159
providers and the cdns are okay with

2241
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:08,040
that um it's it's a complicated tale as

2242
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,260
to how that can be not so great um these

2243
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,840
days read the news look up domain

2244
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,880
fronting and other companies doesn't

2245
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,340
matter

2246
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,659
two slides ago I showed you a bunch of

2247
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:19,920
ways in which

2248
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,820
um we can do very low rate uh comms and

2249
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,440
so the question is could I use my really

2250
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,500
really secure so uh these guys can I use

2251
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,120
the really really secure these guys and

2252
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,520
then build a framework for this that

2253
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,139
actually does what amounts to domain

2254
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:36,000
fronting based handshakes for say tour

2255
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,560
Bridges which is actually what we're

2256
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,840
doing under something called moat and so

2257
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,159
I don't have to use domain fronting

2258
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:42,300
anymore

2259
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,920
um the main funding is a great tool by

2260
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,360
the way but it's just in case it goes

2261
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,620
away the internet Freedom Community

2262
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:50,219
really should have other tools okay

2263
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:51,300
all right

2264
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,820
um on the mpc-based stuff um again this

2265
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,320
is super new and hasn't seen delighted

2266
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,780
day um there's a tech called Kestrel

2267
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:00,600
um it's mpc-based messaging uh it uses

2268
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,120
committees to achieve various you know

2269
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,159
sending of things from Alice to Bob the

2270
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,540
point here to recognize that's like

2271
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,800
really different is that it's not just

2272
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,620
end and encrypted but the address C so

2273
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:12,659
if Alice is sending something to Bob the

2274
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:14,580
value Bob is encrypted right and then

2275
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,080
the servers are using NPC to actually

2276
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,060
pass the messages and you get metadata

2277
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,679
security for free because of that right

2278
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,120
because the underlying servers don't

2279
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,620
even know what they're doing this thing

2280
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,080
can live anywhere iot Raspberry Pi's

2281
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,300
we've put it in multiple Cloud providers

2282
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,699
you can pull boxes out you can put boxes

2283
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:32,159
in like as they're working it takes at

2284
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,560
the scale of like hundreds of like we

2285
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,300
can support like thousands of users and

2286
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,679
hundreds of thousands of servers it

2287
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,020
doesn't it takes about a minute to send

2288
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,360
from any it's a whole it's not like the

2289
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,620
most efficient thing in the world but

2290
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,060
it's pretty darn cool and I'm really

2291
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,320
looking forward to this thing being open

2292
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,480
sourced but it may be a while but just

2293
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,300
FYI uh okay

2294
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,679
um so let's talk about some lessons

2295
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,320
learned uh at the time so uh what can go

2296
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,179
wrong when you're putting uh really

2297
01:29:57,179 --> 01:29:59,699
really distributed and hardcore uh MPC

2298
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:01,860
protocols over really crappy links like

2299
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,020
obfuscated links uh and it turns out a

2300
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,120
lot can go wrong uh like a lot like

2301
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,500
everything can go wrong they talk

2302
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,880
different languages

2303
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,440
um the things that the NPC people want

2304
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,420
in terms of message passing is just a

2305
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,440
completely different freaking language

2306
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,820
from like you know you might have

2307
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,320
thought that oh well you know because we

2308
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,820
start with like pluggable transport some

2309
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,620
Tor like it's kind of similar not

2310
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,940
similar at all

2311
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,980
um Tor was designed for these kind of

2312
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,420
longer term channels and a lot of what

2313
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,460
we're doing is shorter term and we need

2314
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,020
to spin up a lot more of them and it was

2315
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,000
just like like a nightmare

2316
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,440
um okay

2317
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,100
um

2318
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,900
we focused a lot on the underlying

2319
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,520
statistical distributions of the

2320
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,020
underlying traffic but that was only

2321
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,699
half the story the other story was the

2322
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,800
user models so to put another way if I'm

2323
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,380
hiding a hidden message in a in a tweet

2324
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,179
but I'm tweeting at rates that are

2325
01:30:45,179 --> 01:30:47,219
uncommon for Twitter users I'm still

2326
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:48,480
gonna get caught

2327
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,100
right

2328
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,420
um and there's that paper called raven

2329
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,980
that I mentioned a couple slides ago

2330
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,840
that really gets into this

2331
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,520
um but anyhow it was the thing that

2332
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,260
we've been trying to contend with um if

2333
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,340
you want to do something like more you

2334
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:00,780
know because crypto uh we have a really

2335
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,340
cool paper also and I triple creating

2336
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,260
privacy from last year on actually

2337
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,139
building out more um like like hardcore

2338
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:09,840
models um okay uh testing when you're

2339
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,760
talking about uh thousands of clients

2340
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,920
and tens of thousands to uh like like

2341
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,659
tens of thousands of like server nodes

2342
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,400
for the distributed it's extremely

2343
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,260
difficult to test that realistically uh

2344
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,179
we thought we could do it in AWS we

2345
01:31:21,179 --> 01:31:22,980
absolutely could not uh most of what

2346
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:25,620
we're doing right now is um real world

2347
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:27,480
testing for some definition of real

2348
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,860
world

2349
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,020
um and then race really works um if you

2350
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,300
kind of ignore the user model issue

2351
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,040
um and if you just say oh well there's

2352
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,960
no way that you would look at

2353
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,940
like someone tweeting at rates that

2354
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:41,219
would never ever ever happen then

2355
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:42,360
actually it turns out that we can

2356
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,460
actually do this MPC thing on hidden

2357
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,840
channels and it still takes only a

2358
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,179
couple minutes for end-to-end messages

2359
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:49,860
which just to be can like even this I

2360
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:51,120
find shocking like whether it'll

2361
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,440
actually work in the real world like

2362
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,900
like there's a lot more work to be done

2363
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,179
um but but it does actually work

2364
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,219
um and finally in the last minute that I

2365
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:01,980
have um I do want to give um a shout out

2366
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,179
to some of the work that we've done in

2367
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:05,340
AI for internet freedom

2368
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,260
um in particular there's an amazing

2369
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,480
number of companies or entities rather

2370
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,520
that are looking at measuring um

2371
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,440
censorship and they're kicking out like

2372
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,300
a crap ton of data in order to do that

2373
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,060
and what we really need is AI

2374
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,860
um which is not a statement I love

2375
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,440
saying but what we really need is AI to

2376
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,360
actually try to help interpret what that

2377
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,580
data means okay and so here are four

2378
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,780
different teams that we've funded and

2379
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:29,940
the stuff that they've done censored

2380
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,320
Planet which is done by Aurora and

2381
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,780
safiata Michigan her team it's helped

2382
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:36,239
them do massively faster and more

2383
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:37,500
fine-grained understanding of what's

2384
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,480
actually going on they also published a

2385
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,000
great paper on actually looking at the

2386
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,040
middle boxes that the Russian censorship

2387
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,380
regime is deploying at their isps which

2388
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:49,260
I highly recommend you read siphon which

2389
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,659
is an internet Freedom VPN went from

2390
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:54,000
looking at a couple of anomalous events

2391
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,860
a month to being able to look at

2392
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,380
anomalous events across their VPN at

2393
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,540
line speed and kicking up error messages

2394
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,940
within their internal slack like within

2395
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,020
minutes

2396
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,820
which is orders of magnitude more

2397
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:09,239
efficient right it's night and day

2398
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:10,980
um we actually built a model that was

2399
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,659
building a predictive technique for what

2400
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:14,100
social media posts are likely to be

2401
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,260
censored in China and we're working with

2402
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,300
United States organizations to try to

2403
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,420
help enable free communication uh there

2404
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,280
uh we are not going to open source that

2405
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,320
tool because we actually realized that

2406
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,780
uh if we released it other people could

2407
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:29,639
use it as a function of the way to

2408
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:30,960
figure out how to censor basically

2409
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,699
because it literally will take like an

2410
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:34,139
article and it'll like highlight and

2411
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:35,639
read what's going to get censored and

2412
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:36,900
we're like well that's not great to

2413
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,880
release but DARPA didn't make that

2414
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,320
decision we actually talked to the US

2415
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,060
Agency for Global media and that's their

2416
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,560
opinion and they didn't want it released

2417
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,300
so then we didn't release it so sorry

2418
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,760
but it was a little hot

2419
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,060
um and then finally I want to uh Amir

2420
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,739
has this great paper on how the great

2421
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:55,560
firewall is detecting traffic and we're

2422
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,659
done and I got to the end thank you very

2423
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,839
much

2424
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:07,920
yeah thank you very much we are pretty

2425
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,260
over time now so let's

2426
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,659
take questions offline and enjoy the

2427
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:14,780
lunch
