conferences like this without sponsors

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,380
they were very helpful in letting us

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,299
keep prices cheap for students and

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,880

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,239
behalf of the program chairs from London

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,420
myself welcome y'all

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,920

just uh

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,239
I'll start with some quick statistics

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,739
for our conference we received 183

63
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,620
submissions

64
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,040
and we had a quite a large team of uh

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,860
program committee members who had 49 of

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,900

external reviewers

68
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
and we decided to accept more papers

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,200
than last year's uh because the papers

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,040
were good we accepted 50 papers this

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,040
year but because of that uh the talks

72
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
had to be shorter to fit so the talks

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,379
are going to be 20 minutes the

74
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,280
acceptances were 27 we decided uh to

75
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,700
