1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
question is for PGC 2023 Awards we have

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,400
three Awards

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,860
this time

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,460
and the first two Awards is for best

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,699
papers which were selected by the

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,740
program committee

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,560
and we already heard the presentations

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,199
for both of these papers but now we just

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,539
wanna uh

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,359
give something to those the first paper

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,260
is post Quantum anonymity of Kaiba by

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,059
Varun maram and Kate ex-fagawa so is

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,239
Varun was around oh yeah can you take

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
both and uh yeah Deliver us so

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
congratulations

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,180
yep congratulations

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,500
yeah I don't have

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,100
no big

19
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,780
good

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,780
and the second paper is the hidden

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,460
number problem with small unknown

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,100
multipliers kryptonizing Mega and six

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,159
queries and other applications by Nadia

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,880
Henninger and Keegan Ryan

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,780
so I believe we don't have uh the

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,720
author's presence uh I have the frames

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,140
for them if someone can pass them on to

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,420
the authors let me know otherwise

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,100
will mail them or deliver some other way

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,559
but let's congratulate the authors yeah

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,119
and finally uh the test of time awards

32
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,860
for those of you

33
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,579
who don't know uh we look at the

34
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,860
conferences species conferences a

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,520
certain number of years back and this

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,919
year we looked at we actually could

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,319
select papers from pkc 2006 through

38
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,500
2008 and we just looked for the most

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,660
deserving papers and who are we it's the

40
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,840
committee which uh test of time award

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
because you test of time a word

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,260
committee uh we had Julian Jiang who is

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,179
here moti young

44
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,519
and vladen is program cheers and the

45
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,780
committee this time selected the paper

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,340
unidirectional chosen ciphertext secure

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,540
proxy encryption by benue aliber and

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,480
Damien

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,860
and the papers from pkc 2008 so the

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,459
paper solved the noble problem at a time

51
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,599
important problem of

52
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,400
finding CCA secure proxy encryption

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,459
in the standard model and had a complete

54
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,200
solution and there are numerous

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,599
applications

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,220
and I hope

57
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,920
we were supposed to have one of the

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
authors connecting via zoom and

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
saying something do you know do we have

60
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,238
is someone online yes okay

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,400
I have a very nice

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,340
again if someone can pass this to the

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,239
authors would be great let let us know

64
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,400
uh they cannot see them but they're very

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,580
nice and will make sure they'll get them

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,159
why well for the other

67
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,599
so let's congratulate them and

68
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,739
yeah congratulations

69
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,780
and yeah if you can say a few words

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,780
about the work that would be great thank

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,580
you very much

72
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,680
thanks for the test of time award

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
committee and to the committee of pkc

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,120
2008.

75
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,699
uh it's good to know even though I don't

76
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,919
feel like the people really deserves it

77
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
uh about the paper itself back in 2007

78
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,699
or uh in the directional schemes were

79
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,440
pairing best and they were based on the

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,139
idea of uh Computing a bearing of the

81
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,419
safrotex components with the

82
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,479
re-encryption key and as a result uh one

83
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,940
of the components of the reality Cypher

84
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,500
text was in the Target group of the

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,780
pairing and it made it difficult to

86
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,580
publicly recognize a valid

87
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,860
re-encryptions which is useful for cc

88
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,720
security when you want to apply

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,460
connectivity records and things like

90
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,180
that

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,419
So to avoid this issue we used an ID in

92
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,639
paper by Dominion that appeared sometime

93
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,160
before and the idea was to replace a

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
bearing value with randomization of its

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,580
arguments it gave RCC security and some

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,840
assumption

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,000
at that time actually the paper was only

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,040
conditioned conditionally accepted

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,860
because the proof was not quite complete

100
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,320
and we thank the shepherd at the time

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,620
who was and he helped us cleaning

102
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,639
cleaning up the security proof

103
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,259
the proof was okay but the security

104
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,380
model was not quite complete and it

105
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,720
happens that even without security it's

106
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,780
a non-visual task to Define security

107
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,080
uh they were follow-up papers and some

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,380
of them gave stronger definitions even

109
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,960
recently in 2019 in pkc there was a

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,820
paper showing that even if you don't

111
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,800
want to see a security you still need a

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,139
re-encryption worker

113
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,240
even today we don't know if there is a

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,759
widely accepted definition but uh at

115
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,600
least

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,360
we are happy if the paper contributed to

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
the area by uh by asking uh by raising

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,060
the relevant questions about Auto Define

119
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,460
security

120
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,220
um that's it for me and I can leave the

121
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,380
tokens to damina for

122
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,820
anything you want to add

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,080
great so can you hear me yeah so yeah hi

124
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,940
everyone first of all I would like to

125
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,220
thank also the the pkc test of time what

126
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,500
committee I am very honored to receive

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,780
this test of time award for our work on

128
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,650
proxy transcription

129
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,699
[Music]

130
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,039
details on the on the paper uh he can

131
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,319
mentioned that it was inspired by an ID

132
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,620
for mine from another paper of mine but

133
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,240
actually Benoit was the one who

134
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,819
contacted me and initiated this work and

135
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,319
actually many other works we did

136
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,840
together after a while so this is a nice

137
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,300
opportunity also for me to thank him for

138
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,280
very pleasant and fruitful collaboration

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,740
we had over the years

140
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,900
and I am also very grateful to Jorge

141
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,940
Villar who played as when I mentioned

142
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,680
and some very important role in

143
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,139
improving this paper

144
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,300
so it seems that proxy encryption is

145
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,699
still a topic of Interest today with

146
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,360
many research focusing on efficiency and

147
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,340
security and actually there will be some

148
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,220
presentation at this pkc on Wednesday on

149
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,259
uh also you need directional proxy

150
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,120
re-encryption so it's nice to see

151
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
something like that 15 years after our

152
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,400
paper

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
many open problems and I hope that our

154
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
paper will will continue to inspire

155
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,620
researchers on this topic so yeah that's

156
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,300
it for me thank you very much for this

157
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,039
award

158
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,440
all right thank you great yeah let's

159
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,319
congratulate the winners again thank you

160
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,080
very much and uh we'll make sure you'll

161
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,120
get your prize

162
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,840
thank you

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,900
just a break

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,139
or should we stop
