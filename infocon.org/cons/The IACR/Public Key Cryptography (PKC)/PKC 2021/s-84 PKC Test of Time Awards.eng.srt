1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,919
okay you're ready to go

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,799
uh thanks hello everybody

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
we are in the

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
pkc tesla time awards

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,959
and give you some background

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
so as i mentioned when we started the

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,960
conference

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
this is an award that recognizes

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
of standing papers

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
and

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,440
yeah it's a new mic let me change the

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
mic

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
and a second

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
should be better now

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
yes that's better thank you

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
all right i was saying uh we mentioned

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,879
in the beginning

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
the test of time award which

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
recognizes outstanding papers published

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
i see a while back the idea is

21
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
about 15 years ago

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
but this award started really recently i

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
believe 2019

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
and it's trying to catch up so the idea

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
is that they're going to be

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
one you know tesla time award

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
every year and these papers are those

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
which made significant contribution to

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
theory and practice

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
of public key cryptography uh

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
in terms of foundations or you know

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
practice of the

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
field okay and this

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,159
in this edition we the papers that were

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
considered were from pkc 2002

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,719
through pkc 2005

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
and this is evaluated

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
by a selection committee which

39
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,600
typically would include the current

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
program chair

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
which is me in this case uh next year

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
pkc is a program chair that's called

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
shiro hanoka

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,160
last year pkc's program chair lasagnas

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,640
and two members of the pkc steering

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
committee

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
and that's monty yoon and julian

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
zhang this time all right so i mentioned

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
2002 2005 and just to give you

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
um this year we awarded the world like

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
three awards

52
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
and i mentioned this 2002 2005

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
range and just as in context

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
you know this was uh right after

55
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,280
the breakthrough resolved by uh

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,599
you know money on franklin on identity

57
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
based encryption

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
okay popular area the times still is

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,120
and so the first award the first

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
award was uh is given to this paper

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
an identity-based signature from gab

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
difficult by groups

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,879
by that was pkc 2003 by zhao chun cha

64
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
and jung hee cheong and i mentioned the

65
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
context

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
you know the identity basically based on

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
pairings

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
so what this paper proposed was an id

69
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
based signature scheme

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
also based on pairings using gap

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,879
difficulty

72
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,798
groups and

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
let's see so this way

74
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,920
complementing the identity based

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,640
encryption

76
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
aspect so given the basis for a complete

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,560
solution

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
to an id based uh public key

79
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
cryptosystem

80
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
all right and although feasibility wise

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,200
idea

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,799
signatures you know were

83
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
were feasible so this is like the first

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,319
concrete

85
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,920
construction based on the same

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
assumptions and comparable

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
efficiency to the bonnet franklin

88
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,120
encryption

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
scheme all right so join me

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
congratulating uh

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
zhao chun and jung hee and i think they

92
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,000
should be present

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,479
and let me see if they are just they can

94
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
show themselves and perhaps say a few

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
words

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
okay thank thank thank you gary

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
um i'm so happy to

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
uh speak here we checked

99
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
and chung he was so honored to receive

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
pkc

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
test of time on work paper was written

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,479
in the fall of 2001

103
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,680
and then it's unbelievable that

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,880
20 years have passed already since then

105
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
at the time chechn was a poster of

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,160
christ

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,280
and a junior faculty in

108
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
icu who just started a career in

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
academia

110
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
after that we wrote many papers and

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,520
became a professor at

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,039
post again snu in topology and crypto

113
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
but this paper is a truly memorable

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,440
collaboration in our mind we could not

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
imagine that this paper

116
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,199
would imagine remain so influential

117
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,639
for 20 years and would be cited so much

118
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,800
1366 times now

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
and even 14 times this year as of today

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
we are proud proud of formalizing the

121
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,240
security model for id based signal

122
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
signatures and summarizing social maps

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,360
of

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,639
pairing friendly ellipticals also we are

125
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
glad to see the

126
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
that most preparing papers follow our

127
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
notations

128
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,199
id for the public point

129
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,400
corresponding to the id the id for the

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
private point

131
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,199
corresponding to the id and then

132
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,400
attention can keep saying yeah

133
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
you hear me yeah thanks

134
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,440
so this is station another co-author

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,840
so um just one thing uh i'd personally

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
say

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,479
is that a while my friend johnny who

138
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,759
just spoke

139
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
is now a well-known cryptographer well i

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
would classify myself as a

141
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
pure mathematician so who has

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
personal taste of loving computer

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
science and cryptography and actual

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
programming

145
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
uh what i actually want to say is that

146
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,199
uh yes it was possible to obtain our

147
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,319
result

148
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
and because we were sort of a

149
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
combination of

150
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,240
mathematical and cryptographic minds

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
both were

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
absolutely essential and this is

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,000
actually

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
long history everybody knows about this

155
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
kind of

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
interaction between math and

157
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
cryptography and other real world

158
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,759
problem studies so i'm very happy

159
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
to have uh that i had this chance

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
to contribute to cryptography in this

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
way

162
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,360
making just a very small example of such

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
a long tradition

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,840
so uh we would like to express our

165
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
gratitude to

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,319
the organizers community members and

167
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,520
particularly

168
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
to the cryptographic community for their

169
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
long-standing

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
and never-ending interest on our work

171
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
so i guess the award i will get the plug

172
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
with my name but the award is actually

173
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,240
it goes to all the people who proved

174
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
that our research

175
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
was um actually important and useful so

176
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
thank you very much thank you

177
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
thank you

178
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
all right great thanks for the excellent

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
work and

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
us yeah so you're gonna be this is not

181
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,800
it would be much better to be an

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
in-person ceremony but

183
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
um right it is what it is and you'll be

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
the

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
the award days are gonna be receiving a

186
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
plaque for um

187
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,679
for this award all right

188
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,120
so next i mentioned

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,240
signatures in the context of pairings

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
and

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
so the next award goes to an efficient

192
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
signature scheme from bilinear pairings

193
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
and its applications that was in pkc

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
2004

195
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
by fangua zhang rey safavi naini and

196
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
willie susilo

197
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,519
and here uh

198
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,040
the the the context is uh

199
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
so we mentioned signatures so those gave

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
the possibilities of

201
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,839
short signatures and though that's when

202
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
uh the bls

203
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,199
shaham signature came up right

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
proposing very short signatures so this

205
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,959
paper has two

206
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
important contributions one is is an

207
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
alternative proposal to another

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,959
follow-up uh work by bonaire boyan

209
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,839
and regarding the bls uh

210
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
scheme it you know improve the scheme

211
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,440
by uh making sure by by making possible

212
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
making it possible that uh it can use

213
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,640
general

214
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
general hash functions all right as

215
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
opposed to at that point

216
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,680
one mp5 which was not broken

217
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,200
yet i guess so it's an important uh

218
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
milestone in the area of signatures in

219
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
the standard model

220
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
right so joining congratulating um you

221
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,560
know

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
fangua ray and willis cecilia

223
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,079
and i think they are here

224
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
yes thank you can you hear me hi

225
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,800
yeah yeah i'm a john so

226
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
i'm very happy here so

227
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,720
just on behalf of all also our people i

228
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,040
just

229
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
want to be something so actually when i

230
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
have this news i'm

231
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,360
very surprised really but i then i

232
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,480
of course are very excited and happy

233
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,600
because our work is found to be useful

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
in the community and both in the

235
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
academia and the industry

236
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,600
this was just a basic niche scheme

237
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
from body appearing so

238
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
when we created this work we didn't

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,160
accept

240
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
that the work will influence other

241
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,079
future work

242
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
in this area especially in

243
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,920
emerging areas such as clouding

244
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
computing and the broad cipher

245
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
of blockchain you know there are many

246
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
many

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,519
i find many people start our work

248
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,760
to design some protocol some schemes

249
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,120
so so here i together with

250
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
my courses ray and bailey are very

251
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
grateful to

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
the psa iot committee for

253
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
selecting our work and

254
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,079
also we are

255
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,519
honest to join our distinct

256
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,920
colleagues in this session so

257
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
thank you everyone and thanks to

258
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
everything

259
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,839
so jay and already want to say something

260
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,279
no i guess uh both the

261
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,519
program chair and and fungo said

262
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,120
everything that needs to be said about

263
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,079
the paper

264
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
so i just want to it's unbelievable that

265
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,360
it is

266
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
20 years after the time that i was in

267
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
wollongong and

268
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
fanguo was a postdoc and really was just

269
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,560
graduating

270
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,839
with his phd so it was a great time

271
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
who knew that after 20 years we have a

272
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,519
paper that is

273
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
that wins test of the time so we are

274
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
very grateful to the program committee

275
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,360
and the

276
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
test of the time committees who made

277
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,880
this selection so thanks again

278
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
great congratulations again and last

279
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,680
but not least uh the third paper

280
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,719
presuming the award

281
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,440
is a verified random function with short

282
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
proofs and keys

283
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
pkc 2005 by evgeny dodes and alexander

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
jampolsky

285
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
and the context for this is uh you know

286
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
we recall what vrfs are very cool

287
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,920
objects proposed by mikali

288
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,279
raving and saddam and you know what did

289
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,200
we call what they are a prf with

290
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,399
that provides a publicly verifiable

291
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,000
proofs of office outputs

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
correctness okay very interesting object

293
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,639
but up to that point

294
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
what we knew was in a sense a

295
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
feasibility result the construction

296
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
based on an inefficient

297
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
goal by goldbright living transformation

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
all right so this is the first direct

299
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,959
contraction of the

300
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
vrf and

301
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,560
again based on bilinear groups security

302
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
or decisional decision of arena

303
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
difficult

304
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,320
inversion assumption and it received the

305
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,360
best paper award for

306
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,920
pkc05 and we know the impact of

307
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
vrfs right that

308
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
recently became popular in the context

309
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
of

310
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,079
provo state protocols we saw

311
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,279
oblivious prs before

312
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,720
end-to-end secure messaging and

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
communication and so forth where these

314
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,279
primitives are used so we know that is

315
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,880
uh

316
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
there are you know it's relatively

317
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
subtract them in the random oracle model

318
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
but this is uh like the first

319
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
construction in the

320
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
standard model all right so

321
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,880
congratulations

322
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
and i think yeah i see a benny

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
there

324
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,760
yeah i don't know if alex is here but

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
yeah i guess i can start and alex can

326
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,800
join later

327
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,079
first of all yeah i think well i

328
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,519
would like to thank the pcc test of time

329
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,320
committee for

330
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
uh selecting us and more generally i

331
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
i'm really happy with the introduction

332
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
of test of time and words in general i

333
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,199
think

334
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
our community often was very popular

335
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
and trendy at the time might not be so

336
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
trendy in years to come so

337
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
um i i do think that the idea of test of

338
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
time is

339
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
a really great idea in general for our

340
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
conferences and it's kind of fun to

341
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,959
relieve those

342
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
old memories it's also very rare

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
from what i can see is that

344
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,680
the papers that win tests of time award

345
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
very often are not immediately

346
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
recognized as

347
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,560
being significant or important what

348
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
makes this particular paper interesting

349
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,639
i think is uh

350
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,880
actually is one of the rare cases where

351
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
we also won the pkc

352
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,000
uh best paper award in 2005 it was

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
a little bit of a surprise uh i don't

354
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,839
know if there are uh

355
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,320
how many test of time awards also were

356
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
already recognized with the community at

357
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,279
the time

358
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,040
uh but what makes this paper

359
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
particularly unique at least in my

360
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
experience that as a community thought

361
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
it was important the community thought

362
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
was important

363
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
15 years later or whatever um but via

364
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,320
the authors we had no clue so basically

365
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,079
alex was a super energetic student from

366
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,920
gail university attending our reading

367
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
group

368
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
he was very persistent i was super busy

369
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,959
with my students he wanted some project

370
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
he gave a presentation

371
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
i gave him what i thought was a cute

372
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,199
exercise he completed this flying colors

373
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
it was a

374
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
great paper did amazing job we wrote a

375
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
few papers later

376
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
i had no idea the paper is important for

377
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
anything it was just uh elegant uh

378
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,199
mathematically and cryptographically i

379
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
like this working verifiable random

380
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,839
functions

381
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
um so we were basically very pleasantly

382
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
shocked to win the best paper award

383
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,480
uh maybe less so shocked now um

384
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
but basically uh so yeah so it's very

385
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
unique that everybody except for the

386
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,519
authors

387
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,120
so that the paper was significant so

388
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,799
that was nice

389
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,640
but basically the message that i would

390
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,559
like to say that

391
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,720
just basically of course you should have

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
motivation

393
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
when you do your research you shouldn't

394
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,480
work on useless problems but somehow

395
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
follow your heart or follow the

396
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
persistent student and

397
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,959
uh good things will happen and uh

398
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,599
i don't know if alex is here if not i

399
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,559
guess he has a

400
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,520
good excuse he is uh since graduating

401
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
from yale he

402
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
became a ceo of i think he's a current

403
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
of future unicorn company called

404
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,679
security scorecard

405
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,400
so i'm sure this training in this paper

406
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
helped him to become a

407
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,320
multi-billionaire or you know

408
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
millionaire billionaire or whatever it

409
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,200
is so i'll take

410
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
