00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,160
hello welcome to my talk

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
this talk is about qcce secure

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,360
generic key encapsulation mechanism

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
with tighter security in the quantum

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
random oco model

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
first let's record some background

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,840
okm so fujisaki akamoto

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,880
transformation is a well-known and

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
widely used generic key m

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
it can turn a cpa secure pke

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
into a cce secure km

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
and the reduction proof is tightly

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,879
in the random oracle model or rom

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
however facing with the threat

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
of quantum computer

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,039
we need to analyze it in the quantum

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,799
random orca model or qrm

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
in 2017 orphans

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
and others decompose the fo

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
into two transformations named

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
unt

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
they analyze the term and their variants

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,439
into rom and qrom

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
several works are devoted to

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
improve the reduction tightness

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,119
in the qrom

27
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,159
but they all suffer from the

28
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
square root advantage loss

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
until last year good start and the

30
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,040
answers

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
gave a improved runway to hiding lima

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
name the measure we win one measure

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
one way to hide it using it

34
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
the loss is reduced to about d

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,120
square here d

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,840
in the query depth to the random

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
outcomes

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
on the other hand seido ando

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,599
introduced a new security

40
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,040
the ds for public key

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
encryption scheme

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
in 2018

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,040
they gave a transformation named

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
sxy that can turn

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,560
a ds secure ppe

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
into a cca secure key app handy

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
this transformation is similar to

48
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
a variant show you except that

49
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
there is a re-encryption check

50
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,560
in the decryption algorithm

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,159
they also give to transformations

52
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
named kc and t-punk

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
that can turn runway or cpa

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,440
secure pke into dn secure pte

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
however they all suffer from

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,319
the square root advantage loss

57
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,680
besides they require to underline

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,799
pke to be perfectly correct

59
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,040
next year they should send the

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,200
transformation

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,159
sx y even can turn dn security

62
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,120
to qcc security tightly

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
qcca is a stronger security notion

64
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
than cce it will allow the

65
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,238
anniversary to make quantum queries

66
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,400
to the decap solution occur

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
in our work we reduce the

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
security loss of kc to

69
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,440
abort d using the measure we want

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
measure one way to hide it

71
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
once more we remove the

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,199
requirement of perfectly correctness

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
and we prove the combined transformation

74
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
sxy

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
kc and t can turn

76
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
any cpa secure pke

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
into qcca secure kem

78
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,280
with loss about d square

79
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
the combined transformation x x

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,919
y and t c can turn any

81
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,440
one way cpa secure deterministic

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
e into q since a secure

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
key m with loss about d

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
the following is a comparison of

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,639
key m from cp security

86
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560
we achieve advantages of previous

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
works at the same time

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
and our proof doesn't need other

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,599
requirements

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
now let's focus on the transformation

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,520
kc we analyze it

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,560
in two cases of underlying

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,840
deterministic deterministic pke

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
the first case is that the underlying

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
dpke

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
is derived from t

97
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,639
the second case instead is

98
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,840
general that correct dpk

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
recall that the transformation t

100
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
tends to randomize the pe

101
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
into a deterministic pe

102
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
by assigning a hash function

103
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,639
to the encryption randomness

104
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,919
the hash function is modeled as a random

105
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
output in the proof

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
but the correctness nationally used

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
is in the standard model

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
there should not be random oracles

109
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,479
related to it so these two cases are

110
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,120
destroyed

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
to deal with the correctness arrow

112
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
we use a modified ds notion

113
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,720
which will be described later

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,039
and we use an event to separate

115
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,879
some bad cases in the proof

116
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,000
in the first case we define a stat

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
for a randomly chosen message

118
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
there is since another message

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
such as the map to sim cipher

120
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
text in the second case

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,720
we define it that there are some

122
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
messages that can cause

123
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,359
decryption arrow

124
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
these two events can be proved that

125
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,240
they only happen with a small

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,400
probability note that

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
the probability is taken over the

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,839
generation of key pair in both cases

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,319
here we show the definition of ds

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
we say a pke scheme is ds secure

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
if there exists a simulator s

132
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,040
given the probability k as input

133
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
satisfying the following two

134
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
requirements

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
the first is statistical distraughtness

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
roughly seen that the simulator

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
almost always outputs a

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,320
wrong cipher text

139
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,760
the second is cipher text

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,120
indistinguishability roughly seeing that

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
for any efficient algorithm

142
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
a given the probability

143
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,600
and the ciphertext produced from

144
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
normal encryption algorithm of the

145
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,120
simulator

146
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,839
it's hard to distinguish which in the

147
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,519
case

148
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
in our proof to cooperate with the

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
bad event we defined before

150
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
we modify the first requirement

151
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,640
to destroy needs specifically

152
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
we remove the maximum

153
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,240
and consider it into average case

154
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
then we can prove that if the

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,160
bad event doesn't happen the probability

156
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,480
of this draw is very small

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,279
and the destroyedness can be proved

158
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
before we prove the

159
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
cyber tax in distinguishability

160
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
we first record the measure we want

161
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
measure one way to hiding lemma

162
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,320
let g and h b two random functions

163
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
with domain x z

164
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,800
is a random value as

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
in the subset of x

166
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,079
g and h are equal except for

167
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,160
the points in this set s

168
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,760
then for any algorithm a

169
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,279
with alkal access to g

170
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,320
o h there exists

171
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,640
a algorithm d with alcohol access

172
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
to g and h such that

173
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,600
the distinguished advantage oa

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,839
can be bounded by the probability that

175
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:57,839
the output sum elements in s

176
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,760
now we try to prove the

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,560
cipher text in distinguishability

178
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,440
in the encryption algorithm or key c

179
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
a hash or message is added

180
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,560
to the cipher text

181
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,440
but the simulator s shows a random value

182
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,480
and the d part

183
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
to prove the d and synchronity

184
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
we may want to define a function h

185
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,040
prime to be h except for the point

186
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
m star so that we can

187
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
invoke the measure we want manual runway

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
to hide

189
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
to construct when one winnie's

190
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,360
attacker against the underlying

191
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
pke

192
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,959
but m star is not given to the adversary

193
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,240
h prime cannot be simulated

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
directly however we can replace

195
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,079
m star with the set in which are

196
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,880
messages

197
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
that can be encrypted to the

198
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,199
challenge ciphertext

199
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,279
with this definition each prime can be

200
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,040
simulated by test2 whether the query

201
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,079
message

202
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
is in these sets or not

203
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
so cypher text in distinguishability can

204
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
be

205
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
proved

206
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,800
next we will consider the

207
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,199
transformation as x y

208
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,800
corresponding to the proof of key c

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,319
we also analyze it in two cases

210
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,160
the first case is that the underlying

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
dpke is derived from

212
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
key c and t the second case

213
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,839
is that is a general direct correct

214
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
dpk

215
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,000
case 2 has been improved by kusagawa

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
and the yeah mankawa we know that

217
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,440
their proof also works with

218
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,760
the modified ds notion

219
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,279
and keys 1 can be proved based on their

220
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
proof

221
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
specifically to

222
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,320
deal with the correctness arrow we

223
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,040
insert

224
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
two intermediate games into

225
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
their game beast proof

226
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
in the first game we replace

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
the hash function g from t

228
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,600
with g prime that only outputs

229
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
good randomness

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
in the second game we change g prime

231
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
back to g

232
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,720
this method is used in many words

233
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,839
and the distinguished probability

234
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
can be bounded by a lemon named

235
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
generic distinguished problem with

236
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,360
bounded probabilities

237
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,360
in the games between about two games

238
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,079
the decryption is always correct

239
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,360
then the proof of case 2 can be

240
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
reused

241
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,560
finally we can combine of all results

242
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,199
getting that the combined

243
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,360
transformation as x y

244
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,040
k c and t can turn

245
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,279
any cpa secure direct correct

246
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,880
pke into a qcca

247
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
secure kem with loss

248
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
about d square

249
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
the combined transformation as

250
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,199
x y and kc

251
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,199
can turn any runway cpa secure

252
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
direct correct gpk

253
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,320
into a qcca secure kem

254
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
with loss upon d

255
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,720
thank you for listening

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,799
