presentation mode

7
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,879
and then at the top you'll need to swap

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
displays

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
my big screen and

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,679

it's working

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
uh just right up at the top there's a

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
thing that says swap displays

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
well the mac is uh i'm getting the

17

uh uh yeah so i guess the orders are

55
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
right so

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
um we were fortunate this time to you

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,440
know

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,720
uh count on a very talented

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
and energetic program committee

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
which you'll see on the

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
screen next and

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
the help of over 250

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,080
reviewers which will flash

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
in the next three pages

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,720
right and

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,120
next so this year we received

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,199
156 submissions out of which

68
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,919
52 were accepted that's a 33

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
acceptance rate there were six

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
conditional accepts all including the

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
program and there was one soft merge

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
meaning that two papers

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,960
you know on the essentially the same

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
topic uh

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
overlapping results uh were self-merged

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
meaning they're gonna share the

77
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
same presentation slot and that's on

78
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
privacy intersection i believe on

79
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,800
wednesday

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
all right so the reviewing took around

81
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
10 weeks

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
we were a little bit concerned with time

83
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,080
this year because

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
and there was we skipped the rebuttal

85
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,000
phase

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but in any case it was very interactive

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
in the sense that

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
in many cases reviewers were able to ask

89
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,720
authors questions and the results you

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
know the answers were automatically

91
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
posted on the discussion board

92
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
and so forth and we generated almost 500

93
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,960
pages of

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
review discussions and authors responses

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
and in terms of submissions

96
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,639
given uh the emphasis on post quantum

97
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
cryptography this efforts in

98
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
standardizing the

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
this uh area then we this area was

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
encouraged this year and this is

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
somewhat reflected in the program

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,880
in terms of submissions we use uh levies

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
not yet sega levy is a reviewing

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,279
ceremony

185
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
next and finally thanks to our

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
general chairs markov and petros who are

187
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
now

188
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,519
going to take it over thanks

189
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
can you see that

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
yes yeah cool and you can also hear me

191
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
great so i will tell you a bit about how

192
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
this practically works

193
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
uh for those of you who have attended

194
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,600
iscr events uh

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,079
in the in this throughout this whole

196
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,839
period of uh

197
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,480
um yeah this difficult time um you will

198
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,440
already know how

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
how it works uh it's slightly adapted

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,279
from last year's pkc where

201
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,200
it was one of the first conferences and

202
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
hopefully this will be one of the last

203
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,519
conferences on also

204
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,279
yeah let's see um so how will it work

205
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,440
um so the the code of conduct

206
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,360
i think is especially important online

207
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
because it's uh yeah

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
human behavior is easier to regulate in

209
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
the physical world than in the online

210
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
world apparently

211
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
um so we just we everyone should use

212
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,040
their professional name and of course

213
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,000
no inappropriate speech or harassment

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
but it's good to repeat it

215
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
so the recommendation is to keep your

216
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,839
microphones muted at all times except

217
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,880
when asked

218
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,920
by the moderator to ask questions um all

219
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
sessions are recorded

220
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
as now after an announcement in the

221
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
beginning

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
um so the code of conduct there's more

223
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,399
to it of course

224
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,720
than just this uh short summary up there

225
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
so you can find it and in the

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
in the portal under this tab conduct and

227
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,760
this

228
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
this is kind of the whole this portal

229
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
will kind of will be quite important

230
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
throughout the whole conference there's

231
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
also the program

232
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
and the chat and this way you can also

233
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
find

234
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
the talks and there's also a puzzle here

235
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,160
um

236
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
that asks you like that's a crossword

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
puzzle to fill in

238
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
so what else is there so then the online

239
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
material is already

240
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
on the website i think kevin will say a

241
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
little bit later on how to access the

242
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,399
papers

243
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,160
the format is that there are short five

244
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,519
minute talks which are given

245
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
um live and uh there are questions

246
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,920
around that

247
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,560
so speakers as in a physical conference

248
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
should kind of

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
come early to talk with the session

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,959
chair in this case you join the zoom

251
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,000
room

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,920
early on to test your setup for instance

253
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
that screen sharing works uh

254
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,680
correctly so then

255
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
during the session there's a question

256
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
and answers and the panel

257
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,160
so typically there are a few questions

258
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
after each talk um the questions are

259
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,360
asked

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
by raising your hand in zoom which you

261
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
can see in the participants list

262
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
you can write questions in zoom chat or

263
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,639
the preferred solution because that is

264
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,480
more long-term and kind of allows more

265
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,600
interactive

266
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
uh response is to write it in the sulip

267
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
chat

268
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
and the raised hands are ordered

269
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
temporarily like in a regular conference

270
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
so if there are lots of questions that's

271
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
the right way to

272
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
go go for it i think but the writing in

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
swoop is also good so people have a

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,199
kind of one of the session chairs the

275
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
two session shares and one of them

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,600
typically

277
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
will monitor those places

278
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
so there are um uh social events like in

279
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,760
a

280
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
real conference in a physical conference

281
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
um but of course virtual

282
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,160
so one interesting so one already

283
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
mentioned that one interesting oddity

284
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
here is that

285
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
every day the social event starts five

286
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,320
minutes earlier so you will

287
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
so that's the kind of you you get to be

288
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,160
social five minutes earlier

289
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
and then i think on the last day

290
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
actually one hour earlier

291
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
um you join it through um this this link

292
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,519
here

293
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
join the party and there are different

294
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,519
rooms and you can see who is in which

295
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
room and you can also go for random

296
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
assignment if you trust randomness more

297
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,040
than your own choices

298
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,000
so yeah let's let's also try to make

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
that aspect of a conference which i

300
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,959
think is very important

301
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,399
as enjoyable as possible maybe

302
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,240
if you're in the right time zone you can

303
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
bring it bring a drink

304
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,360
and uh yeah so that's uh that's i think

305
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
most

306
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,079
of the organizational things that i

307
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
wanted to go through so last um

308
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
but not uh so this is how you can find

309
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
the zulipchat which is another way of

310
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,199
being social and talk with colleagues

311
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,560
that you yeah that you

312
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,639
usually meet at conferences so it's a

313
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
good good way to interact

314
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,800
maybe talk with new people as well and

315
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,440
so last night

316
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
but not least i want to thank our

317
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,800
our sponsors for their generous

318
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,680
contributions to the conference

319
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
and uh so i'm handing over to kevin i

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,279
think who wanted to say a few words

321
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
yeah just a little bit um there are

322
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,399
possibly some bugs that you'll discover

323
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
in the portal software for which

324
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,279
i hold the unique blame for that

325
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,680
and i'm sorry but i'd be like to hear of

326
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
any problems that you experience with it

327
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
we have had a problem with getting the

328
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,600
links to the papers to work

329
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
there's some confusion about exactly how

330
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
the authentication works

331
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,560
however i'm hoping that by in an hour or

332
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,959
so there will be a new solution for

333
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
having the papers available online so

334
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,720
you can click through to them i've added

335
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,880
links in eprint articles so if you're an

336
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
author and you have

337
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
a paper that's been accepted you should

338
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
upload it to

339
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,399
eprint so that i can add that link and

340
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,079
then send an email to virtual dash

341
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
conferences at icr.org

342
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
and i don't think i have much else to

343
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
say if you have any questions about

344
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
how things are run you can contact k or

345
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
myself

346
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:37,839
and i've put that email in the chat

347
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
oh i should perhaps mention that the

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,800
youtube

349
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
channel and the zoom room will remain

350
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
constant for the rest of the day

351
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,800
so we will stay in this zoom room

352
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,519
and the sessions will be held here

353
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
okay great so i think uh

354
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,959
quan do you want to hand over to the

355
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,119
first

356
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,839
all session

357
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,839
so can you share the

358
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,480
oh no actually i'm stuck again but um

359
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,119
yeah i think it's i can do it so you

360
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,160
know

361
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,079
so the the session she has for the first

362
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,439
session are daniel

363
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,160
upon and christopher petit and it's on

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,679
post quantum cryptography

365
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,039
so yeah maybe you can take over

366
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,000
oh okay uh so welcome to this uh first

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,360
first session of pkc

368
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
2021 um this session is on post quantum

369
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
cryptography

370
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
we have um six

371
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,480
uh six talks uh they will all be five

372
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
minutes long followed by five minutes

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
uh uh q a so the first talk

374
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
is um a paper by julian de verve

375
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
i'm in saxad damian sterli and ron

376
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,360
steinfeld

377
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
on the integer polynomial learning with

378
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,799
our problems

379
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,639
and julia will give a talk

380
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
so if you're here you can yeah hello

381
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,400
all right can you hear me yeah

382
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
all right so

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
can you see my slides now perfect yeah

384
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,919
okay so thank you uh i'm going to talk

385
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,480
about

386
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
the integer polynomial learning with

387
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
errors problem

388
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,039
so it is based actually it is a variant

389
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,600
of the

390
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
polynomial learning with errors we call

391
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
it polynomial instead of ring to

392
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,039
emphasize

393
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,320
the fact that it's based on polynomials

394
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,559
the idea is to find the secret which is

395
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,000
used in

396
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
lwe samples are generating

397
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,080
generated using polynomials and to

398
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
define the integer variant of it

399
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
the idea is to actually evaluate each

400
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
polynomial um

401
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
beforehand before computing the samples

402
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,919
and so you get the

403
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
integer polynomial variance there are a

404
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
few k vats notably

405
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
since you want the secret s and e height

406
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
to have

407
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,720
small coefficients you do some rejection

408
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,919
sampling

409
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,480
uh as to not reduce the secret and high

410
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,039
but f

411
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,039
of q because you want to keep this

412
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,440
notion of smallness

413
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
and if you do so our main results are

414
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,640
that

415
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
these two problems are actually

416
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
computationally equivalent for a large

417
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,039
class

418
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,480
of polynomials f you want them to have

419
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
small infinite norm and small expansion

420
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,240
factor

421
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
and from this we provide a one-way cpa

422
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
secure public key encryption scheme

423
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
under the siplway assumption

424
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,720
so why do we do we care the thing is

425
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
plwe is well studied we know that it's

426
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,480
quantum safe

427
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,960
etc but iplwe is fairly new and

428
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
not that much studied so we want to see

429
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
how different these two problems are

430
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,679
because they look quite similar

431
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,440
and there is a module extension of the

432
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,280
iplwe problem which was used in the

433
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,360
frivolous cryptosystem which is a nice

434
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,480
candidate to the pqc project it made it

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
to round two

436
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,679
and it's in it's an iplw

437
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
is an interesting problem because

438
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,919
heuristically you expect it to have

439
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,840
good security as plwe but also in terms

440
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
of implementation

441
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,520
you can use fast large integers

442
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,480
arithmetic

443
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,159
and maybe get faster implementations

444
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,799
however this is just a heuristic because

445
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
there was no average case reductions

446
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
between the two problems

447
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,080
and this is a gap we feel and

448
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
since we can extend our results from

449
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
polynomial lw to modular we

450
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
we are one step closer to proving a

451
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,240
theoretical security of

452
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,799
reverse but rebels uses the decision

453
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,679
version of the problem

454
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,400
to do so we use what we call the

455
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,039
centered qrb decomposition of an integer

456
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
the idea is to

457
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
write the integer in basis q but you

458
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,400
take coefficients in minus q over 2 q

459
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,200
over 2 instead of 0 q minus 1

460
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,480
so you can also write negative integers

461
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
in this qr decomposition

462
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
and from this you can go from

463
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,320
the the integer ring that we use

464
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,039
by taking some representative range and

465
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,600
you map

466
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,039
the integer a to the corresponding

467
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,880
decomposition polynomial mod f

468
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
it's an interesting map because

469
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,159
depending on whether you have

470
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
more integers than polynomials for the

471
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
reverse it is

472
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,120
an injective or subjective map

473
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
and actually to do our reduction we say

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,320
that

475
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
if we had polynomials if we are given

476
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
polynomials we evaluate them

477
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
and then reduce them f of q

478
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
and if we have integers then we apply

479
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,960
this map to get polynomials

480
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
for both reductions and the idea is then

481
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
in the whole paper the rest of the paper

482
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,240
is

483
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,799
actually studying how what are these

484
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
distributions and how far they are

485
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
from uh the the real distributions used

486
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
in the problems

487
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,039
and in the end we have a reduction

488
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
statement if we take for instance f to

489
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,600
be

490
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
x to the n plus one then if this

491
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
constraint

492
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,640
is satisfied then we have a reduction

493
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,080
and to see how to make this constraint

494
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,919
are true we first it's possible to first

495
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,320
check how many samples you want then

496
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,880
choose the degree of the polynomial

497
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
then sigma prime and sigma are actually

498
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
parameters setting the smallness of s

499
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,520
and e

500
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
so you then set them and finally you

501
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,360
choose q

502
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,919
to be big enough depending on your needs

503
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,039
if you want

504
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
very small noise or not

505
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
there is also the converse reduction is

506
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
also something with the same kind of

507
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,760
constraint

508
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
and then we have the equivalence of the

509
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
problems without increasing the no

510
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
without increasing the noise uh in any

511
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
of the reductions

512
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,600
the tool we used to do so is called

513
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
rainy divergence

514
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
and it's a great tool to use for search

515
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
games but it's hard to use it for

516
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
decision games

517
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
and this is why we only have results for

518
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
search problems

519
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
and this is also why we only have

520
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
one-way cpa security for our pke

521
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
because it's based on a search game but

522
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,960
it's unclear

523
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
how to expand it to decision uh version

524
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,200
of the

525
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,840
of the problems so thank you for

526
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
listening and if you have any questions

527
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,480
feel free to ask them

528
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
okay i guess uh making sure people

529
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
have connected to zulu up or the chat

530
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
iacr and are asking questions there i

531
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,240
don't see any of the moment

532
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
um i guess i can ask uh you know in the

533
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
meanwhile julian um

534
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,919
uh you know how much did you attempt to

535
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,760
you know get a decision version um of

536
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,400
this uh reduction basically

537
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
did you try anything and did it work or

538
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,520
not work right yeah

539
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
the the the main obstruction is actually

540
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
the rainy day the divergence which is

541
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
really not suited

542
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,760
to to this kind of reductions so

543
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
i think our approach cannot really be

544
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
extended to decision you have to tackle

545
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
the problem with a different way one

546
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
thing you could do however

547
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,840
is to use pin square inequality which

548
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
gives an upper bound on the statistical

549
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,120
distance

550
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
as the square root of the log of the ray

551
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
divergence

552
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,080
uh this means that if you take what is

553
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,279
inside the exponential

554
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
and you make it negligible then you get

555
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
the

556
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,799
decision reduction but then parameters

557
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,400
are not that much interesting

558
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,799
any other questions from the audience

559
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,080
okay great if you have more questions

560
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
later feel free to ask we can you know i

561
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,400
guess hang out

562
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,919
you know we're going quick really quick

563
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,279
here through these things so we can ask

564
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
questions later in the session

565
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,640
um okay christie

566
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,159
thanks danielle now uh the next paper is

567
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,039
a paper by giovandra pereira followed by

568
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,080
retro

569
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
on hydrogen-based key compression

570
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,279
without parents

571
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,559
and jovandra will give talk javandra you

572
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:56,880
can

573
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,760
upload your slides

574
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
can you already see the screen yes thank

575
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
you

576
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,919
so i'm going to uh present the esogenic

577
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,559
based

578
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,120
key compression without parents uh work

579
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,480
uh this is joint work with paulo barreto

580
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,360
and um basically isolation based

581
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
basically the key compression techniques

582
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
allow you to reduce

583
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,880
key sizes from about 6 lug p to 3.5 log

584
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,840
per bits

585
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
where p is the underlying prime that we

586
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,279
are working with

587
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,520
for example for a king capsulation

588
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
scheme

589
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
and this techniques not only apply to

590
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,200
reducing key sizes but also ciphertexts

591
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,840
so basically uh we can compress both of

592
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,400
them with

593
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,520
uh about a similar factor and this kind

594
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
of techniques not only apply to kim's

595
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
but

596
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
they can also apply to some misogyny

597
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,320
basic signatures

598
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,279
and the main compression idea is that

599
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
giving a public key

600
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
a pk consisting of a triple a elliptic

601
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
curve e and two points on that curve b1

602
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
and v2

603
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
we want to transmit a short

604
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,559
representation of these

605
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,919
two points for example and

606
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,880
the previous uh the original work would

607
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,679
transmit

608
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
the x coordinates of the points p one

609
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,039
and p two we are

610
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,600
elements uh of the quadratic extension

611
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,320
so

612
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,600
um occupying two log p bits uh each

613
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
current need

614
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
uh but it turns out that there's a a

615
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,279
better way to transmit

616
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
a representation of this point basically

617
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,520
we can note that uh

618
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,880
the points uh pi can be uh expressed or

619
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
decomposed

620
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,279
into a two-dimensional uh

621
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,600
structure uh so basically the subgroups

622
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,559
generated by

623
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,679
a point r and a point s where r

624
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,720
and s uh is our generators for the l to

625
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,760
the intersection

626
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,559
of that ellipt curve and these points r

627
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:00,880
s

628
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
are just a canonical basis so basically

629
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
anyone can

630
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
can compute this basis so basically if

631
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,279
uh the the user that wants to

632
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,559
uh compress its public key they can

633
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,000
simply compute these coefficients a and

634
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
b

635
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,159
which together add up to just

636
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,799
half the size of the x coordinate of the

637
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
point so basically

638
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,880
we can transmit those coefficients the

639
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
other side can just

640
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
recompute that canonical basis from e

641
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
and then we just project

642
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
uh the coefficients to get the points p

643
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,240
p1 and p2

644
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,399
so basically the idea is that previous

645
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
works uh

646
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,399
would uh compute these coefficients this

647
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,520
is the hard part

648
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,279
to actually retrieve these coefficients

649
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
is not a cheap thing

650
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,000
and the way that previous works did that

651
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,880
was by

652
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,200
using pairings so that we get a

653
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,080
projection

654
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,399
projection of pi onto the subgroup

655
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,279
generated by

656
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,640
r and the subgroup generated by s

657
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,279
and uh once you have projected those uh

658
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
instances you can just use pulley

659
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
hellmann on a smooth order

660
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,279
a subgroup of the finite field fp

661
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,080
squared

662
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
and then you can retrieve the actual

663
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,679
question coefficients

664
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,399
so it turns out that in this work uh we

665
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,840
gave a different approach

666
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,360
to perform this projection of the points

667
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
p1 and p2 onto uh the

668
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,039
specific subgroups of order l to the e

669
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,480
but now

670
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,679
not over the uh finite field but over an

671
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
elliptic curve so

672
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,480
basically the idea was that

673
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,520
we basically can uh get this equation

674
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,240
one here

675
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,360
this expression on the curve e for the

676
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,039
points p i

677
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,080
and we can use dualized arginines uh to

678
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,120
move the problem uh back to

679
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,600
the very initial curve that was used at

680
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,559
inside before

681
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
we know how to do to compute this device

682
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,039
isogenys due to recent works by

683
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
negan hennis which can be done

684
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,720
efficiently

685
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,440
so we can move the problem to the very

686
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,120
initial curve is zero

687
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,880
uh that has some special properties

688
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
and basically the coefficients are not

689
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
changed although

690
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,919
the points are changed on the the

691
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,159
initial curve is zero

692
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,600
and then we um like learned that

693
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
basically uh if you use the trace map on

694
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
that curve is zero

695
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,399
that that map maps points onto the base

696
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,919
field of that curve

697
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,840
even if the point is over the quadratic

698
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,279
extension

699
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,000
and then uh we suggested to compute two

700
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
independent

701
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,640
uh maps on this equation two here

702
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
basically applying the trace map and the

703
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
trace map composed with

704
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,000
a distortion map on that curve is zero

705
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,399
so that's usually not easy to find for

706
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
an ellipse curve in general

707
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,960
this distortion map but for zero it's

708
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
it's known

709
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,240
so basically uh we can do that in here

710
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,519
and efficiently and uh also have

711
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
applied these two maps uh what you get

712
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,760
at the end is that uh

713
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,720
you get only points over uh the base

714
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,279
field

715
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,679
but the base field can be generated by a

716
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
single generator g

717
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,399
of four order in that subgroup that can

718
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,240
be pre-computed

719
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,399
and then basically these equations these

720
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
two new equations are going to give

721
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
a season of two equations and two

722
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,399
variables on a and b and

723
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,320
by solving just simpler discrete

724
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
logarithms over this base field

725
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,919
and then solving a system of linear

726
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,960
equations over the

727
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,279
integers we can retrieve those

728
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,159
coefficients a

729
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,399
and b totally avoiding pairings

730
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,480
and just doing discrete locations over

731
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,760
at the ellipse curve

732
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,120
over the base field here so basically

733
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,679
that's the

734
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,440
the main idea of the paper there is an

735
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,200
extra contribution as well

736
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,159
that works for the previous works for

737
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,120
the

738
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,200
quadratic extension of the defined field

739
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
but also for the ellipse curves which is

740
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,919
reducing per

741
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,320
computed tables that i don't describe in

742
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,880
here but we got a factor to

743
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
to reduce those tables by uh doing some

744
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,720
uh

745
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,360
applying some tricks so basically we

746
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,880
implemented our ideas in magiman

747
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
and for psycp7501 uh

748
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
we were able to reduce the the table

749
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
sizes the pre-completed table sizes to

750
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,399
solve this discrete liberations

751
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,919
by a ratio of about 28 to 20 to 28

752
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,519
depending on the torsion that we are

753
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,960
working on

754
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,000
and if you look at the

755
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,039
time in terms of uh multiplications over

756
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,440
the

757
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,720
the base field the equivalent uh we got

758
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,960
a 25 to 48

759
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
uh improvement when no compare

760
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,799
computation is used

761
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,200
if per computation is yours then our

762
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,840
method is

763
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,880
slower but uh if no precomputation is

764
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,159
required then

765
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,279
uh it's a bit faster and i think that's

766
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,159
basically what

767
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,640
i had to say thank you

768
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,399
great thank you um because if you have a

769
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,600
question

770
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
uh so we noticed there was a prior

771
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,799
question that was posted i guess it

772
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,240
takes people a couple minutes to type

773
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
which is a little different you don't

774
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,399
can't raise a hand and pause um easily i

775
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,080
guess you can raise a hand and

776
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,760
zoom um

777
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
so are there are there any questions uh

778
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,480
for juventra

779
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,930
uh there is there is a question on the

780
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,080
[Music]

781
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,720
on the zoom chat by marcus scarves

782
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
what's the cost of pre-computation

783
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,799
yes so uh basically

784
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,720
uh this is the number of uh alpha fp

785
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,640
equivalent multiplications over the the

786
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
finite field oh

787
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
you mean uh the offline costs are

788
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,200
the offline cost i mean

789
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,199
the alpha line the cost is not uh it's

790
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,440
just building a table of size

791
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,839
uh 2 to the m rows or l to the m

792
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
depending on the version

793
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,440
times the exponent of the the subgroup

794
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,000
for example

795
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
e here for psych uh if you are on the

796
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
the two version

797
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
is uh uh 372

798
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
and if you are on the three iteration is

799
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
239 the exponents here

800
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
so basically the the the size of the

801
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,079
table is going to be

802
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
372 times 2 to the m in the first case

803
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,239
or

804
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,079
239 times uh 3 to the

805
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,960
uh some small number uh w sorry

806
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
so basically uh you just need to build

807
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,879
the table of that size

808
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,280
uh and the table is going to store some

809
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,239
um

810
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,760
finite field elements uh

811
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,280
so basically uh yeah it's it's a it's

812
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
pretty quick to generate these tables

813
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,079
and it's an offline part so basically

814
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,599
um it's it's faster than doing the

815
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,400
online part

816
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,040
definitely uh but we do it off offline

817
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,880
anyways

818
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
i don't know if that uh answers the

819
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,440
question or

820
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,320
okay uh there is another question but uh

821
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
you might want to take it offline uh on

822
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,200
the

823
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,920
on the julie chap um by thomas press

824
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
what oxen do you use to solve this

825
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
simpler deluxe

826
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,800
so maybe you can answer that on the chat

827
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,040
uh as a reminder to everybody uh it's

828
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,760
best to

829
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,680
ask questions in the to lead chat rather

830
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,839
than here on the zoom

831
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,359
whenever possible okay thank you very

832
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,400
much uh

833
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
uh giandra giovandra sorry

834
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,520
um the next uh talk is uh this the next

835
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,240
paper is

836
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
an alternative approach for sidh

837
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,400
arithmetic the paper is by sierra

838
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
bouvier and lauren bear

839
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,880
and lauren will give the talk so wrong

840
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,880
yes thank you christoph can you hear me

841
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,280
okay let me restart my

842
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,680
video

843
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
so as a reminder every speaker gets in

844
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,119
theory five minutes

845
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,320
and then five minutes q a um if you can

846
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,880
stick to that

847
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,599
you might slide properly no

848
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,440
honestly myself yeah you should move

849
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,839
your slicer yeah

850
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,960
perfect yes fine okay

851
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
so thank you for uh the introduction so

852
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
i'll try to uh

853
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
keep it to five minutes so uh we go

854
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
straight to the point

855
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,520
and in uh psych or inside the edge you

856
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,079
need to

857
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,760
do uh the arithmetic over

858
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,400
quadratic extension of fp where p is a

859
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
prime of the form two to the a3 to be

860
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,599
minus one

861
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,880
and psyc that is the nist

862
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,480
proposal there are four crimes that have

863
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,359
been proposed

864
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,040
at different security levels um

865
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,680
so the contribution of this paper is an

866
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,560
attempt to do

867
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,480
the arithmetic in these special

868
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
primes especially in the quadratic

869
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
extension fp square

870
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,480
faster so for that we use a different

871
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,320
representation for the elements so for

872
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
example if you want to represent an

873
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,800
element

874
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,359
v that belongs to fp square we're going

875
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,440
to do that with integer polynomials

876
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,320
with boundary coefficients such that

877
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,000
this number v

878
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,640
will be represented by polynomial u such

879
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,200
that when evaluated at the gamma

880
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,400
it will give my v for a fixed gamma that

881
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,599
is a

882
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,160
value that belongs in belongs to f p

883
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,920
square

884
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
so the given this representation so no

885
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,320
polynomials we do the arithmetic by

886
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,280
simply adding or multiplying two

887
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,400
polynomials

888
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,040
mod e where e is another integer

889
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
polynomial that vanishes

890
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
at gamma and of course when we do these

891
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,000
operations for example you can think of

892
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
linomian multiplication the coefficients

893
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,119
of my output polynomial will grow

894
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,280
uh and then we need to find a way to

895
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
reduce this coefficient to stay within

896
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,520
the boons

897
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
bounds that we set at the beginning so

898
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,960
for

899
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,599
for that we need a few things we need a

900
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,280
m that is also a polynomial that

901
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,920
represents

902
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
zero just like e and m prime which is

903
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,240
the inverse of

904
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,760
m in in summary and the way we do the um

905
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,040
polynomial the coefficient reduction is

906
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,280
very similar to the classical montgomery

907
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,480
reduction

908
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,960
applied to uh the coefficient of our

909
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
polynomials

910
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,119
so if you take c uh a polynomial with

911
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,680
large

912
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
non-reduced coefficient for example the

913
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,960
for example the result of a

914
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
multiplication

915
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
you can get a representation of c

916
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,520
divided to some well chosen power of 2

917
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,960
by doing the usual montgomery

918
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
multiplication you add the correct

919
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,160
multiple of m

920
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,640
that is a representation of zero and

921
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,680
then you can

922
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,839
you can divide by two to the omega and

923
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,839
if you do that you need the

924
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,320
big o of n square multiplication is if n

925
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
is the degree of

926
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,960
your polynomials what we

927
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,160
present in the paper is a special way to

928
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,880
a special subset of the uh what we call

929
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
the pm and s basis the

930
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,480
polynomial representation where the

931
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,760
polynomials and

932
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,359
m prime that are here are very sparse

933
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
and have small coefficients

934
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,880
and also the in this case the um

935
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
under under some conditions that are not

936
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,000
so difficult to

937
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,119
satisfy the digits of q and r

938
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,599
also satisfy recurrence relations so

939
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,760
that we can now implement the montgomery

940
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,880
reduction

941
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,480
in big of n multiplications

942
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,680
so uh because we have five minutes let's

943
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
go to the uh

944
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,560
the results uh of course our code is

945
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,680
available

946
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920
but if you follow this link uh what you

947
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
get if you download the code

948
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
is you get a psych the original psyc

949
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,359
where

950
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,440
we added uh layers for the arithmetic

951
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,000
for

952
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
two primes the original psych p503

953
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
and we give two variants using our

954
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,599
polynomial representation

955
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,520
and a new prime that we call p736

956
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
and we compare that to the original

957
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,920
uncompressed implementation

958
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
of psyc that you can download here

959
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,040
so just for uh one result this

960
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,760
new prime that we proposed is this this

961
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
number

962
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,440
uh can be represented with the degree

963
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
tree polynomials

964
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,240
with a coefficient that fit into three

965
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,240
64-bit words uh so it's

966
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,119
slightly smaller than psycp 751 but in

967
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,319
the same

968
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,280
order of magnitude for if we look at the

969
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
security level

970
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,960
so in this table we give the number of

971
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
clock cycles for the basic

972
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,240
arithmetic operation mod p so we see

973
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,000
that our montgomery reduction that

974
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,440
corresponds to the equation

975
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,480
reduction is uh is very very fast

976
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
uh and overall the uh arrangement in

977
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,079
what p is faster

978
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
and it also translates to the arithmetic

979
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
over f p square

980
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,599
and we didn't give the result in this

981
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,359
five minute talk but the overall speed

982
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:37,920
up for

983
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,599
psych algorithm signature or

984
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,160
sorry encryption or connection is about

985
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,560
17

986
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,119
and to be sure i stay within my five

987
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:49,839
minutes

988
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,920
uh we believe that this way to represent

989
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,160
the an element of a finite field for

990
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
psych is advantageous

991
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
uh we also know that we only scratch the

992
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
surface of this field

993
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,839
uh we need to find more good primes in

994
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,000
particular we need to find

995
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,920
efficient basis for fpsquare directly

996
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,800
and i will end my presentation now

997
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,640
great thank you looking for

998
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,680
questions for lauren um

999
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,599
and also i'm gonna just point out uh

1000
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,280
just for the sake of time uh

1001
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,440
julian and uh giovandra there are

1002
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,280
questions for you in the

1003
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,400
um in the chat air

1004
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
aicr here a couple of them there so

1005
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,680
we'll leave those offline

1006
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,839
any questions for lauren

1007
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,720
okay well let's uh in that case take any

1008
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
questions you have for them to the chat

1009
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,359
and you can answer them

1010
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,839
um later um you know thank you for the

1011
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:08,640
for the great work

1012
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,599
uh speeding up psych is is very valuable

1013
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,960
um

1014
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,760
thank you all right yeah uh well if

1015
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,119
there are for a question away

1016
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,400
and then we have some time in the end we

1017
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,560
can also take them after

1018
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,599
after all the talks uh the next talk in

1019
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,319
this session

1020
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,359
is a pay-per-call analysis of

1021
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,280
multivariate encryption schemes

1022
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,319
an application to to dub uh the paper

1023
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,280
has been invited

1024
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,000
uh to the journal of cryptology um so it

1025
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,119
was considered a

1026
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,760
one of the best paper of the conference

1027
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,680
um the paper is by martin

1028
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,119
o'garden patrick felke and

1029
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,599
harvard redham i hope i'm pronouncing

1030
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,480
properly

1031
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,240
and martin will give a talk so martin

1032
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,680
let's go ahead yes thank you very much

1033
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,919
um

1034
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,839
so let me see do you see the screen now

1035
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,200
the presentation yeah right so uh the

1036
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,079
paper focuses

1037
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,200
on we see your screen we don't see your

1038
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
slides

1039
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,720
ah you don't see any slides yeah just

1040
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,520
wait a second

1041
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,200
let me yeah here we go right now

1042
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,680
now you see it yeah perfect okay thank

1043
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,880
you that's

1044
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,040
always something right so the paper

1045
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,720
focuses on multivariate encryption

1046
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,359
schemes

1047
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,119
um and particularly the bob encryption

1048
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,240
scheme

1049
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,920
and the contribution is sort of twofold

1050
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,280
so first of all we

1051
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,920
we talked about how not only to uh

1052
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
determine the first four degree but also

1053
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,520
the number of degree of polynomials that

1054
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,160
we get there

1055
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
and secondly we sort of use this

1056
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
information in order to develop an

1057
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,800
attack and you attack against this

1058
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,520
scheme

1059
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,280
so we also believe that these ideas

1060
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,560
could be used

1061
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
for other multivariate sort of big field

1062
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,000
constructions as well

1063
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,680
sorry yeah so the setting is that you

1064
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,119
will have your probability will be the

1065
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,640
quadratic polynomials

1066
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,119
and they are constructed sort of using

1067
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,720
these f polynomials

1068
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
and sort of unmodified system so they

1069
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,760
will come from one of these

1070
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,800
big field constructions so in our case

1071
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,079
this will mean that

1072
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,640
they can be in um it can be inverted if

1073
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,000
you have a secret key

1074
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,119
however this other system causes that to

1075
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,200
be these degrees or polynomials

1076
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,960
um meaning that there will be

1077
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,880
combinations of polynomials

1078
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
uh that will have a smaller degree than

1079
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,079
what you would normally expect

1080
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,920
so unfortunately if this is kind of

1081
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,680
without any modifiers this will

1082
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
mean it's insecure because it's that

1083
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,960
much easier to compute

1084
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
grab the bases here which is why you

1085
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,680
would want to add these sort of modifier

1086
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,359
polynomials so this would be

1087
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,200
quadratic polynomial secret polynomials

1088
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,280
that you add on top of it

1089
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,839
um and sort of the dub case would be the

1090
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,640
that the fis will come from

1091
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
the double dobertine permutation and the

1092
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,200
modifiers will be internal perturbation

1093
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,319
and q plus modifier

1094
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,800
so the key contributions is that we are

1095
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,520
able to derive

1096
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,960
exact formulas for the number of

1097
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,119
degreeful polynomials

1098
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,079
up to degree five

1099
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,680
and they are exact in all of the

1100
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,160
experiments

1101
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,760
moreover if you sort of fix

1102
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,880
variables to zero we call it projecting

1103
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,680
then the these formulas will remain

1104
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,720
exactly because they

1105
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,119
do kind of predict the number of degree

1106
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,000
for

1107
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,560
different polynomials and the first fall

1108
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,920
degree may also

1109
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,400
decrease as a result of this

1110
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
uh so what we find is that if you do

1111
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
sort of project the polynomial system

1112
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,240
and then go up and compute

1113
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
these three four polynomials then you

1114
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,920
would be able to learn

1115
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,240
some of these secret modifier so

1116
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
localized versions of them after they

1117
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,079
have been protected

1118
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,200
so the idea of the attack is that if you

1119
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
kind of project along different sets of

1120
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,319
these variables

1121
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,319
then you kind of you find these

1122
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,839
localized versions of the simply

1123
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,119
modified polynomials

1124
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,400
and then you are able to kind of glue

1125
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,960
them all together to really get this

1126
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
this whole polynomial back um

1127
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,560
and the reason why we want to project

1128
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,119
this is um

1129
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,640
there's two reasons for that first of

1130
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
all as we see in

1131
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,599
point two here uh there may be kind of a

1132
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,960
smaller personal degree

1133
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
meaning that you only have to go up to a

1134
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,480
smaller degree and secondly there will

1135
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,160
be sort of less variables in the system

1136
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,680
and that much more easier to compute for

1137
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,400
an attacker

1138
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,480
so i think for the 80-bit parameter

1139
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,280
parameters we're able to kind of project

1140
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,160
over hash then

1141
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,680
have the variables and then compute

1142
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,280
and do note that we are really just

1143
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,720
setting them to zero so there's no

1144
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,319
guessing involved there's no sort of

1145
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,359
exponential

1146
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,640
many times you have to do this process

1147
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,240
so sort of the brief summary is that we

1148
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,599
are able to break these suggested

1149
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,200
parameters 8-bit security

1150
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,599
for the dub encryption scheme um so what

1151
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,880
your three will be

1152
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
for the internal perturbation we

1153
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,160
retrieve sort of the whole

1154
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
modifiers for the q plus we retrieve

1155
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,000
sort of the quadratic part so you can

1156
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,760
find more information about that in the

1157
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,200
paper

1158
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,720
we believe that these ideas could also

1159
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,240
be applied to other

1160
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,839
big field constructions other central

1161
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,920
maps like c star and hfe and other kind

1162
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,280
of popular modifiers

1163
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,119
uh in this setting and particularly

1164
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,200
effective against encryption schemes uh

1165
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,720
for signature schemes you can where you

1166
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,400
can kind of apply a lot of these

1167
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,800
minus modifiers that would be able to

1168
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
kind of talk the attack

1169
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,280
yes so that's sort of the paper in a

1170
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:49,839
nutshell there

1171
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,280
okay thank you

1172
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,920
oh i was muted there excuse me yeah

1173
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,160
thank you yeah

1174
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,240
it's fun yeah go ahead daddy i'm sorry

1175
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,280
oh sure sure um so on the this prior

1176
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,119
talk so um

1177
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,960
uh do we have any questions there for uh

1178
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,520
for morton

1179
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,559
i guess the audience is being

1180
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,480
particularly quiet today if it's early

1181
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,359
or something for someone

1182
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,240
okay great i guess you know so one of

1183
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,000
the questions i might ask morton just

1184
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,680
uh just to get you know some kind of

1185
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,280
discussion is um

1186
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,040
have you have you tried looking at other

1187
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,760
schemes uh with your technique

1188
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,440
uh that you just developed and whether

1189
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,800
you're able to pull any bits of security

1190
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,079
off of anything else or

1191
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,680
if you have an idea of like what might

1192
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,440
be a very interesting direction to look

1193
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,640
at because you named a couple of the

1194
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,319
options right

1195
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,920
um yeah so um well i mean initially what

1196
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,520
we wanted to do was go ahead and look at

1197
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,400
these um

1198
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,480
i mean the gem schemes that i would be

1199
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,599
having with

1200
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,800
minus um but that has unfortunately been

1201
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,319
broken by what is probably

1202
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,000
at least the scheme a better attack um

1203
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,200
but i think it would have been

1204
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
interesting i mean it would have given

1205
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,559
you something interesting about kind of

1206
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,680
algebraic attacks

1207
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,119
if we had kind of chosen that route um

1208
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,960
i think there's also um we could go back

1209
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,319
so if you want another example um we did

1210
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,599
a

1211
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,119
kind of a previous paper on e flash so i

1212
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,400
will be

1213
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,480
using the c star with with minus and

1214
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
projection um

1215
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,359
and i think you could kind of really

1216
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,720
improve the attack there so that would

1217
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,079
be sort of another

1218
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,720
another example that you could go

1219
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,880
yeah i think that's okay great thank you

1220
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,920
so much

1221
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,720
yeah thank you very much

1222
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,319
okay um are there more questions um

1223
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,359
move forward all right

1224
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,079
so the the next talk in the session is

1225
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:58,480
is

1226
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,960
about a paper called multivariate public

1227
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,800
key cryptosystems from

1228
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
seed on spaces or science spaces that's

1229
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,160
quite sure

1230
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
um the paper is by netanyahu and langton

1231
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,040
and ichiak tama and um

1232
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,319
netanyahu will give the talk

1233
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,400
thank you christoph can you hear me okay

1234
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
see my slides

1235
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,040
uh yes we can hear you yeah we don't see

1236
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
you

1237
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,359
in the slides yeah we see the slice we

1238
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,720
don't see you

1239
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,359
don't see me i i see him at the top it's

1240
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,040
just uh

1241
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,720
oh yeah now i see you sorry

1242
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,640
uh thank you for coming to my talk i'm

1243
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,760
glad to be here

1244
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,559
i'm going to be uh briefly talking about

1245
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,880
a new multivariate public key crypto

1246
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,920
system

1247
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,559
that is constructed from fairly new

1248
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,000
algebraic concept called

1249
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,720
seedling space

1250
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,200
acetone set is a set of positive

1251
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,759
integers

1252
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,280
such that if you have two pairs of this

1253
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,400
set that their sums go inside then they

1254
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,960
must be the same pair

1255
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,680
in other words if you are given a sum of

1256
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,280
two elements from this set you can

1257
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,079
identify the summing

1258
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
in this field of study the main question

1259
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,760
is what is the largest t

1260
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
meaning the size of the seed on a set

1261
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,559
could be with respect to the range m

1262
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,240
obviously the range has to be large

1263
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,359
enough to contain all distinct pairs

1264
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,040
and matching constructions exist

1265
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,720
in this talk we're going to discuss

1266
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,440
crypto application of a variant of seed

1267
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
onset called seed on space

1268
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,079
that can be seen as a multiplicative and

1269
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,760
linear algebraic variant

1270
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,640
of seedling sets

1271
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,440
system spaces were defined for pure

1272
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,920
mathematical research around 2015

1273
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,400
and have found the applications in

1274
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,839
network coding a few years

1275
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,559
afterwards the subspace v

1276
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,280
of an extension field f q to the n over

1277
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,839
b still

1278
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,359
f q is called acetone space

1279
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,920
if you take any two pairs of elements

1280
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,720
from it

1281
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,839
and multiply them if the

1282
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,160
results of the product coincide then

1283
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
these must be the same pair

1284
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,680
up to multiplication from the base here

1285
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,880
again in other words if you are given

1286
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
the result of the multiplication

1287
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,839
you can determine the identity of the

1288
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,119
pair uniquely up to multiplication from

1289
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,920
a scalar from the base

1290
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,920
where is the scalar coming from since

1291
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,839
you can always squeeze an element from

1292
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,760
the base field into the product

1293
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,280
and the product won't change

1294
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,440
in this field of study the main question

1295
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,640
is how large

1296
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,720
the element k which is the dimension of

1297
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,400
the seed on space b

1298
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,319
with respect to m to n sorry

1299
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,480
a similar counting argument as we just

1300
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,079
saw show that n

1301
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,559
has to be

1302
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,839
okay and in construction by me and my

1303
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,839
collaborators from

1304
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,319
a few years ago achieves that now target

1305
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,920
this simple this construction is without

1306
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,440
getting into technical details

1307
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,119
this is give or take um take gamma

1308
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,119
which does not lie in the intermediate

1309
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,119
field f2 to decay

1310
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,079
and this would be a seed on space which

1311
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:28,960
achieves

1312
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,880
the upper boundary

1313
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,720
intuitively for any two elements

1314
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,240
in acetone space b if you wish to factor

1315
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
the product a b to its constituent

1316
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,440
elements a

1317
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,119
and b you must know the seed on space b

1318
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,440
this calls for applications in public

1319
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,160
key cryptography

1320
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,720
alice will choose a secret key which

1321
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,200
would be

1322
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,640
a seed on space b

1323
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,040
she will publish something some public

1324
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,680
key

1325
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,359
that a keeps the c dom space b private

1326
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,920
and b enables the sender to compute

1327
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,720
products in b

1328
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,000
the sender will then encrypt his

1329
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,559
map his message into two elements

1330
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,200
perform

1331
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,319
the encryption which would be the

1332
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,240
multiplication of these two elements

1333
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,079
again without knowing the season space p

1334
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,559
alice when she'd get this product we'd

1335
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,200
be able

1336
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,480
to factor a b to a and b since she knows

1337
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,559
the c dot space

1338
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,559
and eve will not be able to do that

1339
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,000
since she does not know

1340
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,599
um the subspace v

1341
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,760
i can't get into more details given the

1342
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,599
time constraints but i would only say

1343
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,040
that the resulting system

1344
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,839
is a multivariate cryptosystem where

1345
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,040
solving

1346
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,240
this attack amounts to solving a

1347
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,720
non-homogenous bilinear system

1348
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,359
over f q

1349
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,760
we analyze the hardness of the system in

1350
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,599
a few aspects

1351
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,839
normally multivariate cryptosystems are

1352
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,760
broken by mid-ranks attacks

1353
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,480
in one of two formulations either the

1354
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
kernel formulations

1355
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,240
also known as shamir thickness or the

1356
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,799
minor formulation

1357
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,200
in this paper we show that in both these

1358
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,280
formulations the attacks succeed only

1359
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,839
with exponentially small probability

1360
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,760
and we support these findings with

1361
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,040
experiments

1362
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,280
as well as discuss specialized attacks

1363
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,319
that are not of these two forms

1364
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,119
i must disclaim that we are not claiming

1365
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,720
any breakthrough in postpartum

1366
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,680
post-quantum cryptography here we only

1367
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,000
show

1368
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,480
that these attacks fail and we don't

1369
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,680
have a

1370
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,599
hardness proof for the seed on crypto

1371
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,400
system in general

1372
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,040
if you'd like to hear more about how

1373
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,599
alice publishes her secret seed on space

1374
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,559
or about how can bob compute products in

1375
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,720
this secret season space without knowing

1376
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,599
it

1377
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,839
or why do we believe that kernel or

1378
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,839
minor min rank attacks fail

1379
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,480
you're invited to watch the photo or ask

1380
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,880
me

1381
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,520
in any form thank you

1382
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,640
great thank you um i guess i can ask if

1383
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,400
there are any questions as before

1384
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,440
um one of the questions i had um when i

1385
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,240
read this paper

1386
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,520
uh was whether you had uh

1387
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
derived i guess recommended parameters

1388
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,440
like concrete parameters and said oh you

1389
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,079
know here the

1390
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,480
exact numbers for 100 bits of security

1391
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,920
or something like this

1392
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,040
uh no we did not do that uh

1393
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,160
we do however have uh experiments of the

1394
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,280
um

1395
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,440
the straightforward webinar basis attack

1396
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,599
and how long does it take as

1397
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,559
a function of the um the parameters q

1398
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:52,960
and k

1399
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,839
of the system

1400
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,839
any from a question

1401
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,640
okay um well that is

1402
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
we'll switch to the last talk of the

1403
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,400
session

1404
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
um this is about a qcca secure generic

1405
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,160
key encapsulation mechanism with titus

1406
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,880
security

1407
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,200
in the quantum random american model uh

1408
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,440
the paper is by show you and

1409
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,839
ming chang one and shuyu will give the

1410
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
talk

1411
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,200
okay my talk is about the

1412
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,200
key in cut solution magnesium

1413
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,480
usually we get a strong secure pm

1414
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,680
from a weak secure pke by a generic

1415
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,640
transformation such as the fisa and

1416
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,799
motor transformation

1417
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,280
it can be decomposed into two

1418
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,319
transformations

1419
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,160
named u and t see how tight reduction in

1420
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,119
the

1421
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,839
random oracle model while it's not that

1422
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,400
in the

1423
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,040
quantum random rendermaker model

1424
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,000
especially

1425
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,920
they have square to advantage loss

1426
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,280
until last year kuchsta and all give a

1427
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,359
improved 1v2 hiding lemma

1428
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,520
named the manual rewind manual to hide

1429
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,480
it

1430
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,760
then the loss is reduced to about d

1431
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,359
for the transformation you

1432
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,680
said

1433
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,880
give another way to achieve cce security

1434
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,079
they introduced a new security notion

1435
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,440
named the ds for pke ski

1436
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,240
and this shows that a variance of

1437
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,599
transformation u

1438
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,200
named sxy can turn

1439
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,480
can titling turn dlc qrpke

1440
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,799
into cce secure tf

1441
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,680
and these they give two transformations

1442
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,799
namely qc

1443
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,920
and teapot that turn vary our cpu secure

1444
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,799
ppe

1445
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,240
into dncqpp however

1446
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,480
they are suffer from the square root

1447
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,640
advantage loss

1448
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,440
besides they require the underlying pke

1449
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:31,920
to be

1450
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,440
perfectly correct next year

1451
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,200
they should they prove that the

1452
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,799
sxy even can turn gi security

1453
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,160
into qcc security title

1454
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,200
qcc is a stronger security than cca

1455
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,559
it allows the adversary to make quantum

1456
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:53,839
queries to the

1457
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,839
the capsule or call

1458
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,440
in our work we reduce the security loss

1459
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,359
or pc to a body using the memory one

1460
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,599
millimeter to hide enamel

1461
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,640
once more we remove the

1462
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,920
requirements of perfectly correctness

1463
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,319
and we proved that the combined

1464
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,520
transformation

1465
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,040
as x y k c and t can turn an ecp

1466
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,240
security

1467
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,920
into qcc secure km with loss about

1468
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,720
t squared

1469
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,400
the combined transformation as x y and

1470
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:32,880
kc

1471
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,119
can turn any one vcp secure

1472
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,319
deterministic

1473
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,359
pke into qcc secure

1474
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,400
with loss of body we combine

1475
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,920
advantages of pre previous works

1476
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,839
and our proof don't need other

1477
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,839
requirements

1478
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,200
we analyze kc in two cases

1479
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,240
using uh the

1480
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,319
uh marijuana monitor hiding

1481
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,160
the first case is the underlying

1482
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,920
dpk is derived from t the second case

1483
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,480
inside

1484
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,280
is a general delta correct dpp we know

1485
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:17,920
that

1486
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,599
the correctly correct is not notion

1487
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,799
the user is in the standard model it

1488
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:28,400
doesn't apply to the gpk

1489
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,079
in the randomizer from t

1490
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,760
to to deal with the correctness arrow we

1491
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,039
we use a modified yes notion and we use

1492
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,480
an event to separate some bad cases in

1493
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,319
the proof

1494
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,520
we see a pte scheme is dear and secure

1495
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,559
if there exists a similar s

1496
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,400
satisfying the following two

1497
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,039
requirements

1498
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,680
in our proof to cooperate with the bad

1499
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,400
events

1500
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,480
we defined before we remove the maximum

1501
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,240
in the in statistical disjointness

1502
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,319
and consider it into average case

1503
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:20,960
since the destroying needs can be proved

1504
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,400
the cipher attacks in distinguishability

1505
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,640
can be proved using the marijuana mirror

1506
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,319
monitor hiding

1507
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,160
then uh it it can transform

1508
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,359
it can't it can transform or

1509
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,839
ds distinguisher into a very nice

1510
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:38,640
attacker

1511
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:45,839
against the online dbk

1512
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,039
for the transformation sxy we also

1513
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,079
consider

1514
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,480
it in two cases corresponding to the

1515
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,799
proof or key c

1516
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,079
case tool has been proved and kiss one

1517
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,200
can be proved

1518
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,720
based on its proof specifically

1519
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,559
we insert two intermediate games

1520
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,680
where we replace the function g

1521
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,720
from transformation t with

1522
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,760
g prime that only all simple

1523
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,960
good randomness so

1524
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,599
so that the decryption is always correct

1525
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,079
then the proof of keys 2 can be reused

1526
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,079
now combining with the results

1527
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,280
of t kc and the sxy

1528
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,280
we can get the final result

1529
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,240
that's all

1530
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,960
can

1531
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,240
yeah so um yeah thank you for the talk

1532
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,599
uh you know um

1533
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,280
so i guess we're gonna wait and see if

1534
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,200
anyone else has questions

1535
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,799
for zhu here i guess i'll let everyone

1536
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,079
know that there's a there's a

1537
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,200
lot of chat happening in uh

1538
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,598
the chat function there

1539
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,839
i think this is a question great i think

1540
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,920
this is a question from uh marco

1541
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,599
for you do you think that tightness

1542
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,280
matters in practice example for

1543
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,480
standardization

1544
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,599
how would you make the case

1545
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,839
so that's a question for june

1546
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,119
a question

1547
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,839
yeah the question is uh do you think

1548
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:50,480
that the

1549
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,200
tightness of these transformations uh

1550
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,960
matters in practice

1551
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,720
or is it you know i guess the the

1552
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,079
alternative would be is it more of

1553
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,200
theoretical interest

1554
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,240
uh what is your position

1555
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,359
so you you see the

1556
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:18,960
tiniest in the tiniest

1557
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,240
is it is the tiniest importance

1558
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,240
in the practical yes it is this question

1559
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,960
uh i think yes

1560
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,400
so i guess today's question is how would

1561
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,359
you make the case for that

1562
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,480
sorry my english is not so good

1563
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,920
that's good uh i guess we can we can

1564
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,520
take it offline and you can uh answer

1565
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,000
them there

1566
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,280
in written um and uh you know i guess i

1567
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,000
can i can

1568
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,240
comment that uh yes it seems to matter

1569
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,200
in practice

1570
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,960
um although you know um it's of course

1571
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,799
nicer to have a tight reduction

1572
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,760
um in particular uh if you just analyze

1573
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,119
a reduction your you know some kind of

1574
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,720
transformation you're already using and

1575
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,079
you know lo and behold it you know you

1576
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,000
get it you get a tight proof um yes this

1577
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,359
matters and it's helpful

1578
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,880
um if you have something that's not

1579
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,200
tight uh you know i guess you could

1580
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:15,760
always just

1581
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,200
you know cross your fingers and hope

1582
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,119
that it's not a problem right

1583
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,799
uh which sometimes this actually happens

1584
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,960
in practice you just kind of assume that

1585
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,960
uh that the tightness is okay and you

1586
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,240
set your parameters assuming that it's

1587
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,160
tight even if it's not so

1588
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,240
it's uh come on there um i guess we have

1589
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,440
time for

1590
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,160
where there are wheel attacks there was

1591
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,200
no tight proof and

1592
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,079
yes there was a attack later on it was a

1593
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,920
real problem so

1594
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,920
yes but let's take it offline it's very

1595
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,319
interesting

1596
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,559
fun discussion

1597
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,280
i think the other questions have been

1598
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,079
answered in the chat don't see any seems

1599
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,359
so and i'm sure people will be online

1600
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,400
throughout the day throughout the

1601
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,079
conference to answer more questions if

1602
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,960
anything else comes up

1603
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,559
okay so there is a couple break now

1604
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,200
and then followed by an invite talk

1605
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,039
session at

1606
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,040
3 well 2 30 you
