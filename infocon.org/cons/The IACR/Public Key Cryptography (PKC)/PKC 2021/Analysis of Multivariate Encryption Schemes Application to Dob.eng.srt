1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,919
hi i'm morton and this talk will focus

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,520
on the dopp encryption scheme

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
so we'll see how to estimate the grifo

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,519
polynomials

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,120
and then we'll propose a new attack that

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,960
breaks this scheme

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
so the techniques that we present here

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,160
will also be

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,680
relevant to other multivariate

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
constructions and particularly the

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,680
big field schemes so this has been a

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
joint work with patrick felke and hobart

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,519
adam

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,160
so first we will introduce multivariate

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
encryption schemes will focus on

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
the dot encryption scheme so typically

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,320
you will have

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,239
a system of quadratic polynomial

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
equations and

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
would let the field be gf2 in this case

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
so to encrypt you

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
simply evaluate your polynomial system

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,840
on the plaintext you have

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
which gives you the ciphertext for

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
decryption you have to solve this

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
resulting system essentially inverting

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
this to recover your

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,800
so the benefits are post quantum

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
security

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
efficient encryption and typically

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
smaller ciphertexts

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
the drawbacks however have however are

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,760
could be large public keys decryption

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
are often inefficient depending on the

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
scheme

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
and the security is also very hard to to

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
get right

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
especially for multivariate encryption

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
schemes

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
so this is sort of the standard setup

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
for big field encryption schemes so you

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
choose two invertible matrices

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,360
and then you have your extension fee

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
lysomorphism

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
so you start by kind of applying one of

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
your matrices

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
then you go up to the extension field

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
now you apply some sort of simple

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920
function polynomial over your extension

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
field

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
and this is chosen such that it's easy

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
to invert

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,759
then you go down again and apply a last

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,119
matrix

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,719
so composing everything from left to

56
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,479
right will give you your

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,840
public key and these

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
these polynomials will now be quadratic

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
if you have chosen your f to be

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
yeah if you have chosen your f properly

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,878
so the idea for

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,160
macario and patara was to choose

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
um the double team polynomial about the

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
impermetation for f

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,800
and you may note that sort of this

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
polynomial in knob itself will have a

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
high degree

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
but what the audits show is that you can

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
find

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
kind of given the um the ciphertext you

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
are able to find

72
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
a polynomial equation with low degree

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
which you can then use for the corrupt

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,400
decryption so uh where it's easy to sort

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
of find roots

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
so that means that all of these uh maps

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
in this construction are invertible

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,239
and sort of inversely inverting it

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
piecewise will be how you decrypt

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
now if you take f kind of if you use

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,519
this as

82
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
is and take f as a public key then this

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
would have been

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
insecure so it's and

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,800
unfortunately it's like an unavoidable

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
consequence when you are choosing f like

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
this

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
that there are um degreeful polynomials

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
as they called

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
so in this case there will be degree of

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
polynomials at degree 3

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
meaning that there are combinations

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,159
where we take our

94
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,519
our quadratic public key the f's

95
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
multiply it with certain linear forms

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,519
and

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
you'd a priori expect this to be of

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,959
degree three however this is actually of

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
degree two

100
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
and this is uh this makes it that much

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
more vulnerable to growing the basis

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
attacks which is essentially essentially

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,040
how you are able to solve this as an

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
attacker

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
so in order to kind of avoid this or

106
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,959
hide these degree from polynomials

107
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
you typically modify it so we'll talk

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
about the two types of modifiers that's

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,680
used in

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
the darp encryption scheme first one is

111
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,238
the internal perturbation ip

112
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
so now you choose k linear forms

113
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
bis and then you sort of add quadratic

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,599
combinations of them

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
to your public key so sort of if if f is

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
your old public key you add quadratic

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
combinations and

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
this leaves you with kind of the new

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,519
modified public key

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
the other modifier which is used in

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
conjunction is

122
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
with the ip is q plus so now you choose

123
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
t

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,320
random quadratic polynomials the queues

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
and now you add linear combinations of

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,440
them to the public key much in the same

127
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
way as you did

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
above

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
and these modifiers will be secret only

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
known to the

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,680
owner of the secret key and how you

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
decrypt now is that you sort of you

133
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,080
guess

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,479
correct values for these linear forms as

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,199
well as these

136
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
quadratic polynomials so for each such

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
guess

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
you essentially end up with kind of your

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
f system again

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
and we saw how to decrypt that in the

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
previous slide

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
so that also means that you can't choose

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
too many of the modifiers because this

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
definitely increases your

145
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,919
decryption time and also if an attacker

146
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,360
is able to

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
somehow retrieve the modifiers that

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
would have broken the system

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,560
so the modifiers doesn't ah yes

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
and just to give you an idea of the

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
suggested 80-bit parameters

152
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,560
they choose sort of d to be 129 and

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
t and k so that's your linear forms and

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
a quadratic polynomial is out to be six

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,039
so um adding these modifiers i mean it

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,520
doesn't

157
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
completely remove the

158
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,039
degree faults from the system but it

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,919
typically

160
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,440
sort of forces them to appear at a

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
higher degree so the idea is that if you

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
add enough of them

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
the degree falls will only appear at

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
such a high degree that it's infeasible

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,759
to compute

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
so now we're sort of going to

167
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
try trying to estimate how many of these

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,639
degree

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
polynomials there will be so so first of

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
all we'll estimate

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
when they will appear at which degree

172
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
they will appear which is typically

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,160
known as the

174
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
the first fall degree uh but we'll also

175
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
go a bit further and kind of

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,840
estimate the total number that we expect

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
to find

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
so since they only care about the grief

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
polynomials now we'll work with

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
homogeneous ideals and greater rings

181
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,720
uh we'll kill off all the squares and

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,199
so for any polynomial we'll just

183
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,000
consider the

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
leading form so that's the the highest

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,680
degree part

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
and then we'll define sort of the ideal

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
of the public key so that's the

188
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
quadratic parts of all these public

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
polynomials

190
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,440
and we also define the modifier ideal

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
which could then be both the ip

192
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,319
combinations and q plus combinations

193
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
only the quadratic part

194
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,199
and then pl will denote the degree part

195
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
of of

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,199
the ideals so for example p3 will be

197
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,000
sort of the quadratic public keys as

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,400
well

199
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,960
as any linear combinations of them

200
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,400
so let's kind of recall how we actually

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,759
defined a public key so we had

202
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,520
and again now we kind of only care about

203
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
this the quadratic part of it

204
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
so we do have this original public key

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
the unmodified public key fi

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
and now we add kind of combinations

207
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
that are kind of random coming from q

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
plus and ip

209
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,000
and this is how you get your modified

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
public key

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
so we recall a kind of there will there

212
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
were a lot of these degree fault

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,919
polynomials so we know that there are

214
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,520
these um combinations um

215
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
we can kind of multiply with with the

216
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,000
the f polynomials that will sum to zero

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
since we're only caring about the the

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
highest degree part

219
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
so if you do take these combinations

220
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
these g combinations so now

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
put p in place of f here

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
that will get us something so by

223
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
definition the f parts uh sums to zero

224
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
and we're left with something that's

225
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
only depending on the the

226
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,199
the oh that's depending on the modifiers

227
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,440
that would be in the modifier ideal

228
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
so sort of the first observation is that

229
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
if you have a lot of these degree for

230
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
polynomials

231
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,960
and the the dimension of your

232
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
modifier ideal at a certain degree is

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
not that high

234
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
then you would still kind of expect to

235
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
see the grief of polynomials even in the

236
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,759
modified system

237
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
so this is sort of the intuition we have

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,039
for um

239
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
for this sort of first formula

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,399
estimating these

241
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,360
degreeful polynomials so for a degree in

242
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,599
e

243
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
we kind of look at uh s and f which will

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
be

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
sort of the the non-trivial

246
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
sysgs the griefal polynomials in the

247
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
unmodified system so we count them first

248
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
m is the modifier ideal so that

249
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,040
that i mentioned there and then p and m

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
is sort of a correction component as

251
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
we've written here so we don't want to

252
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
count things twice

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
and at some degrees there will be some

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,839
overlap between m and p

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,720
so so that's that sort of things but the

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,120
the

257
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
the main idea is sort of that at

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
at least the smaller degrees all of

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
these components can be computed

260
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,480
so so this can be computed by looking at

261
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
this sort of simple description over the

262
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,760
extension field of the double team

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
polynomial

264
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,480
and m is also relatively easy to compute

265
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
because you

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,240
assume because the modifiers are

267
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
randomly chosen so you can

268
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
assume some generosity of them on them

269
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
right

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
so so so this is not the only estimate

271
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
we can sort of think of

272
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,760
um so up to now we kind of assume that

273
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,680
all of these degrees for original degree

274
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,519
of polynomials plays a part

275
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
but we can also have a estimate we only

276
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,760
consider certain subsets of them

277
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
so the kind of kind of benefit to this

278
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,120
is that

279
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,959
now we don't have to remove everything

280
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,680
from the modifier ideal but kind of only

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
certain sub ideals of that

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,079
and sometimes that is a good trade-off

283
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,839
so just to mention that then we'll kind

284
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
of denote them with

285
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
kind of different numbers here and kind

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,839
of see the paper for more information

287
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,519
so essentially kind of at each degree

288
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
you get a finite

289
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
amount of these estimates that we saw an

290
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,680
example of on the last slide

291
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
and then we take kind of at each degree

292
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,079
the largest of these estimate is what we

293
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,600
expect to be

294
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
the degree of polynomials that we'll

295
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
find

296
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
and if all of them are negative then we

297
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680
simply expect there to be no one

298
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
so to give you an example this is how it

299
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
looks for degree three so this is kind

300
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,440
of the

301
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,160
the estimate where we count everything

302
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
so then we do have 2d

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
degree four polynomials in the

304
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
unmodified system and this is how the

305
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,120
modifier idea looks like so this is the

306
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
contribution from ip and this is the

307
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
contribution from q plus

308
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,040
if you go up to degree four things look

309
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,720
uh a little bit more messy but it's

310
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,959
still kind of reasonable

311
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,000
so um so this

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
this part sort of mostly grows by a

313
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,760
factor n

314
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
the modifier ideal gets a little bit

315
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
more complicated but we still have

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
kind of clearly defined this is the

317
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
contribution from q plus from ip and now

318
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
we sort of have to

319
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
not count things twice essentially

320
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
and at this degree we also get some of

321
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
this this

322
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
extra component we actually didn't get

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,480
that degree three

324
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
but here this will be d in this case

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
this will be the number of public

326
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,000
polynomials

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
and t plus q choose 2 will be the number

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
of kind of quadratic

329
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
uh modifier polynomials so it's actually

330
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,839
just multiplying those

331
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,200
those polynomials together

332
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
and we kind of come back to this this

333
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
part later this will be important

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
so we can see that like how does this

335
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,160
actually look

336
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
in reality are they are these formulas

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,519
capturing it

338
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
um and the answer seems to be yes so

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
here each row is an experiment um these

340
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,360
four first row columns will be

341
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
different parameters this is what we

342
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
predict from our formulas

343
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
so we have kind of written out these

344
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
formulas up to degree five

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
um and and kind of this is the number

346
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,160
that we predict

347
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
and this is the number that we get from

348
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
kind of running these experiments

349
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,000
and so the the first observation is that

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,279
these numbers always

351
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
agree with each other and

352
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
another observation and i should also

353
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
mention that kind of this is this is not

354
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
just these few uh experiments we've

355
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
actually run

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
i think we have almost four uh pages

357
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,839
full of tables

358
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
like this in in um in the extended

359
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,639
version of the paper so

360
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
it's like for all the experiments we run

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
these formulas are actually exact so

362
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
here we also see that

363
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
different kind of formulas different of

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
these estimates become dominating

365
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,959
depending on the

366
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,279
parameters and lastly we also note that

367
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
we have d which is the number of public

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
polynomials as well as the degree of the

369
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,720
field extension

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
but we also have n which would be the

371
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
number of variables

372
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,839
and now in the dub encryption scheme

373
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
these are the same

374
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
but we do allow for n to be smaller than

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,560
d

376
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
as we can see here so that was sort of

377
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
that would mean that an attacker kind of

378
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
guesses the values of some of the

379
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
variables which is known as a hybrid

380
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
attack

381
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,760
so here we see that kind of and kind of

382
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,480
guessing values like this

383
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
changes the the number of degree for

384
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
polynomials

385
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
but we see that we are like our formulas

386
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
are still exact even in these cases

387
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
right so after this point we have kind

388
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
of we've categorized uh

389
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,320
the number of degreeful polynomials at

390
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
least up to degree five

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
um and we also have categorized this for

392
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
um for the for the hybrid method this

393
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
this kind of guest and then when grouped

394
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
on basis algorithm

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
and already this is kind of enough to

396
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,199
say something about how

397
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
easy it is to run these grommet basis

398
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,199
attacks but we'll go a bit

399
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,279
further and kind of use all this

400
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
knowledge to propose

401
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
a new attack on this scheme

402
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
so recall at degree 4 we had this

403
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
formula here

404
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,800
and we also had this kind of correction

405
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,839
component

406
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
which we said was this or the the number

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
of public polynomials d

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
times the number of quadratic modifier

409
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
polynomials

410
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
but what happens if we add a randomly

411
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
chosen quadratic polynomials pr

412
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
to the system

413
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,320
so then we actually expect this d part

414
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
to grow with one

415
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
and this is actually this is both what

416
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
you expect kind of from the theory and

417
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,000
this is what we are

418
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
seeing in practice as well because this

419
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
means the kind of

420
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
since we've added this to the system

421
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240
then we also kind of get these

422
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
combinations

423
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,079
all the quadratic modified polynomials

424
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,760
times this new polynomial

425
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
so in some sense this cancels out from

426
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
from this dimension because it's already

427
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,439
available in the system

428
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,720
and what that means is that now we can

429
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,440
kind of

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
do the computations go up to compute

431
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
degreeful polynomials

432
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,279
uh and then we look at how does this new

433
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,720
sort of random elements um

434
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
contribute in making these degreeful

435
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
polynomials

436
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
and it turns out that kind of because

437
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
from what we discussed this will be kind

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
of

439
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
like it's multiplied with these modifier

440
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
polynomials

441
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
so essentially if you are able to go up

442
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
and compute the grievous polynomials you

443
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:55,920
do learn

444
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,600
something about these secret modifiers

445
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,839
now this is a slight simplification uh

446
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
you also get like trivial ccgs

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
but we'll deal with that kind of in more

448
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
more detail in the paper

449
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,800
so we do learn something about the

450
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
secret modifiers

451
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,839
however it's kind of this might still be

452
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
quite difficult to compute directly

453
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,240
because it's a high

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
maybe a high degree a large number of

455
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
variables and all that sort of stuff

456
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
so our solution to that is actually

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
setting some of the variables to zero

458
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
just a zero

459
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
um so let's make it easier i mean

460
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
there's less variables and

461
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
from our formulas we also saw that this

462
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
can sometimes mean that the

463
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,880
personal degree is is smaller

464
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
and the idea is that kind of we do have

465
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
this set of variables we set all of them

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,320
to zero

467
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
so that's what this notation mean that's

468
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,199
just the polynomial gi where everything

469
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,399
all of these are set to zero and we see

470
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
that the same observation really holds

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
so we kind of get these

472
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
uh the referral polynomials even in this

473
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
projected

474
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
system we do have the same thing so we

475
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
learn

476
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
we still learn something about kind of

477
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
these local polynomials these

478
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,039
secret modifier polynomials that's been

479
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,439
projected

480
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,079
so if we can kind of do this for

481
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
different variable sets we are able to

482
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,919
kind of glue together these different

483
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,119
local polynomials and kind of get

484
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,039
the global modifier polynomial which is

485
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
what we want in the first place

486
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,600
so instead of kind of doing everything

487
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,880
at once we are

488
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
projecting along um sort of much smaller

489
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
sets and we are able to kind of glue

490
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,000
together and recover this polynomial

491
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
um so for more details on how we

492
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
actually do that you can you can look up

493
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,080
in

494
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,120
in the paper and this is really saving a

495
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
lot of both time and memory so for

496
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
example for the 8-bit

497
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
suggested 8-bit parameters we're

498
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,559
actually able to set over

499
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,880
half the variables to zero kind of using

500
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
these ideas

501
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
so this is a very very simplified

502
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
overview of the tech you do choose

503
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,799
certain variable sets after some rules

504
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,720
you kind of form this extended system by

505
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
adding this randomly chosen

506
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,559
polynomial now for each of these sets

507
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,600
you kind of

508
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
project you set all the variables here

509
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
to zero and then you kind of

510
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
go up compute degree four polynomials

511
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
which will give you these

512
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,039
sort of local or the projected modifiers

513
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
and now once you've collected all of

514
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
them from all the different variable

515
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
sets you kind of glue them all together

516
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,559
to find

517
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,400
the quadratic form of these secret

518
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
modifiers

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,559
what we find is that for the ip modifier

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,880
we are able to recover everything even

521
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,039
like the linear forms so we are

522
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
completely breaking that sort of

523
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,000
modifier

524
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
for the q plus we actually only learn

525
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,919
the quadratic part but we don't learn

526
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,240
the

527
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
the linear part of it so um

528
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,080
in a sense you could say that we learned

529
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
the most important part but not

530
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,440
quite everything so how does this look

531
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,919
for the

532
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,880
suggested databit parameters so recall

533
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,400
that this

534
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
here they are so we um

535
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
we are able to kind of run the attack uh

536
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
described on the previous slide

537
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
kind of retrieve this um quadratic form

538
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,400
of the modifiers

539
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
of using 2 to the power of 63 operations

540
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
and kind of using this information um

541
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,919
we um we sort of

542
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
using a naive method we kind of guess

543
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
guess values for the modifiers and then

544
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,600
you sort of

545
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,320
do add them to your system and then run

546
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,840
group

547
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,640
uh this will require about kind of in

548
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,280
between this

549
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,400
this um this uh

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
between two to power 67 and two to the

551
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
power of 77 operations

552
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
so that depends on how fast you're able

553
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,600
to do your linear algebra

554
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,880
and the reason why it still takes a

555
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
little bit of time is that kind of you

556
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,919
lack this linear part

557
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,720
of of the the q plus modifier so that's

558
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,799
the only thing holding us back

559
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,240
so we don't write anything more about

560
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
this in the paper but this might

561
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
presumably be even more improved say for

562
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,480
example using uh

563
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,919
rank techniques or something like that

564
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
so i do really think that

565
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
to the 563 is sort of the security that

566
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,960
this system actually has

567
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
right so um concluding um

568
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,919
the the attack that we do have break the

569
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
suggested parameters for the dub

570
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
encryption scheme

571
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
and i'm not really sure how to kind of

572
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
make things

573
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
change things tweak things such as

574
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
secure and efficient so

575
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
i mean you could obviously just apply

576
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,840
you know

577
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,919
a lot more modifiers but that really

578
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,960
ruins your

579
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
decryption time so as i

580
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
briefly mentioned in the beginning the

581
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
ideas could also be applied to other

582
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,320
central maps

583
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
typically like c-star and hve for

584
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,400
example and other modifiers where

585
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
minus vinegar and projection are very

586
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
popular ones

587
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
so this is all very effective against

588
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
multivariate encryption schemes

589
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,159
but signature schemes are seen at the

590
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
big field schemes um

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
can easily be sort of protected against

592
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,159
this for here so here you can for

593
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,720
example

594
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
uh choose a significant amount of miners

595
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,600
without

596
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
while still being effective so that is

597
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
one way to do it

598
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
that was it
