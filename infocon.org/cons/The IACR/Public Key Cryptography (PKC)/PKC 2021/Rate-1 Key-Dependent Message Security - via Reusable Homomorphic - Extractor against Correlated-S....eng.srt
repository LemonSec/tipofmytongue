00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,599
hello everyone i'm chi chi lai

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
the title of our paper is read one pdm

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,279
security

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,920
via reusable homophobic structure this

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
is a joint worker with fungal anatomy

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
when considering security for encryption

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,279
schemes

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
we always assume that the messages are

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,320
independent

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
of a secret key in this case even the

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
mass m is chosen by the adversary

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,680
he can still get no information on m

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,199
from the corresponding

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,558
server test however in some situations

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,680
the plaintext message depends on the

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
signature

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
in this special case the previously

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
semantic security

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,879
seems to be insufficient to providing

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,839
security

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
to solve the security issue the notion

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,440
of

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
kdm security has been proposed

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,000
and the relationship between the message

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,360
and the sixth key

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
can be generally described by certain

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
function class f

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,959
from sixth key space to message space

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
in this case the query from the

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
adversary

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
is modeled as a function f and the

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
answer from the challenger

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,280
is a the server test of fsk

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,920
formally the ktm security can be

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
described by a security

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
security game between the challenger

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,720
another adversary in the following way

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,119
at the beginning the challenger first

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,880
choose a random beat

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
at the end send the master public key to

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,119
the anniversary

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,360
then the adversary can conduct key

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
extrusion

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
and the kdm queries during this

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,320
processes

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
the challenger answers kingdom queries

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
according to the

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,960
previously chosen b finally

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
the adversary respond a bit b prime

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
we see we see that the adversary wins

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
the game

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
if b equals b prime

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
in particular the kvm queries are formed

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,680
by

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,280
functions from ktm chinese class

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
and if b equals 1 the challenger returns

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
the inclusions of functions of secret

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,599
key

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,319
otherwise the challenger returns the

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,120
inclusions

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
of 0.

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
in this formal definition the class of

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
function f

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
chosen by the adversary is an important

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,879
parameter

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,080
of kdm security which is called pdm

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
challenge function class clearly the

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,560
larger challenge function class

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
means the stronger ability of the

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
adversary

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
and we have tried to enlarge kdema

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,319
function class

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,680
from secular function to a file function

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640
and then to projective function and

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
general bounded side circuit

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
besides there is also another important

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,879
parameter

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
the number number of different public

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
keys in the security game

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
in a more general case we will call this

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
as ktm unbar security

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440
there is the many pke or ibe scheme

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,400
that pdm circuit with respect to

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,879
different

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
ktm challenge function class and

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,480
different

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,000
number of public keys in particular

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
all the schemes are based on various

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
assumptions

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
such as ddh pcr qrlw

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
european orcidh however

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
all those existing schemes have the

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,239
common drawback

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
their information rates are quite small

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,080
so on my question in this paper is that

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
how to construct arcadium umbra circuit

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
pke with

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
optimal information rate

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
and the my result of this paper consists

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,799
of

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
ktm one circle pke with optimal

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
information rate ktm ambassador pke with

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,720
optimal information rate

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
for unbounded polynomial number ktm

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
member circle ibe with optimal

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
information rate

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
from bounded polynomial number in

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,798
addition the above pku or ibe is

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,279
also literally resilient with optimal

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,000
leakage rate

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
against block leakage function here i

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
focus around

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
the first result under the others

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
can be viewed as its extensions

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
in order to describe or technique or

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,759
more

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,840
clearly we adopt the following framework

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,240
view

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
first this paper tells us that

120
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,720
homomorphic wgps implies ktm1 security

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
second bureaucracy is at all the paper

122
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,720
turns out that

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
batch encryption plus all operation

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
implies ktm1

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
plus and leakage resilience

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,199
however the parameters in those two

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,479
papers are little bit

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
restricted so we try to improve that's

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,919
provide

130
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,080
period results in the following three

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
aspects

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,639
first achieving optimal information rate

133
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
second set unbounded polynomial above

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,120
third generalize the result to the

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,919
ibe setting inspired by the two people

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
we consider whether we can get much

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
better ktm circuit construction

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,440
from wps with with additional

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
structure plus morphing stratum

140
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
of course before this we should

141
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
introduce the building blocks

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,199
wgps and the homogeneous charger

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,039
a weak high-speed system

144
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,320
consists of four algorithm the first one

145
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
is the center of algorithm which outputs

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,080
a pair of pks k

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,479
the second one is a valid income

148
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
solution algorithm

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,479
which outputs a valid several times city

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,280
and each

151
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
incredible solidity key the third one

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
is the invalid income solution algorithm

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
which outputs

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
an invalid advertised city star

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
the fourth one is that of the

156
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,680
consolating the server test using the

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,000
sig

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,479
key normally the required gps

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
should satisfy the following three

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,759
properties

161
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
the first one is chronic it is specified

162
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,759
that

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,039
the inconsolated key from the valid

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
valid income solution algorithm should

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,199
be equivalent to that of

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,080
logical solution algorithm the second

167
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,560
one

168
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,199
is several times the

169
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,759
indistinguishability

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,639
is specified that even gave a sixth key

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
the adversary still cannot distinguish

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
the valid server test from the

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
corresponding evaluator one

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
the third one is an information

175
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
theoretical property

176
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
in particular it is specified that

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,039
given the public key and the invalid

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
sanitizer city star the remaining

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
entropy of key prime

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
is still larger than w

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
additionally we still need the following

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
useful structure of

183
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,159
weak hps

184
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
the first the secret key is the vector

185
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,720
from

186
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
z p to n second given vector k prime

187
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
the invalid subtract star can be

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,319
simulated

189
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,880
physically third the decal solution of

190
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,879
invalid several times the cd star

191
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,919
through using

192
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000
silky vertix equals vector x plus

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
vector q prime where where the cube

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
prime is

195
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
relative to the invalid severitized

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
cd star

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,560
besides the weak hps we also need to

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
introduce homomorphic structure as a

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
building block

200
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
before this we review the definition of

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,199
a planar nominees

202
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
character generally an efficient

203
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,479
computable function is starting from x

204
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,360
times s who y is called to be e

205
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
structure

206
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,479
if the output of a structure rs

207
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
is statistically close to uniform

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,879
here the source s should have

209
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,399
enough conditional amino entropy

210
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
and the homophobic structure with

211
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
respect to

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,679
a foreign class h means that

213
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,880
for any function small h in

214
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,880
a class ph it holds

215
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,680
the output of distributor times h s

216
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
equals

217
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
strata h prime x s

218
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
here h prime is an invertible function

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
and the efficiently computable given

220
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
corresponding

221
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,880
function h

222
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
with above two pin blocks we can

223
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,279
describe

224
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
our basic schemes in the following way

225
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
first the cage algorithm is that write

226
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
the center of algorithm

227
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
of wgps and output the corresponding pk

228
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
sk

229
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,320
second that the encryption algorithm is

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
that

231
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
run the validity incorporation algorithm

232
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
of wps

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,959
look at a valid summative city and its

234
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,560
income solution key and then compute

235
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
several tests in this way

236
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
now we analyze the pdm security of the

237
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
above construction

238
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
for secret key vertex and the kidney

239
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
query function h

240
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,519
from sig's basic message space it holds

241
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,839
the original ktm advertised is

242
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,920
indistinguishable from the below

243
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
randomizing several tests through using

244
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
properties

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,079
and additional structure of wgps

246
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,440
so we get a conclusion we indeed

247
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
we indeed can't prove the security for

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
just one ktm

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
server test

250
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,480
clearly from the gps and homophobic

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,279
strata

252
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,880
as a restricted ktm1 security

253
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
scheme can be constructed

254
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
however it seems that the above proof

255
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,240
turning

256
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
can only support a one ktm query

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
as its indistinguishability release our

258
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,720
entropy of the

259
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
ascii key and we cannot ensure the

260
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,079
enough entropy

261
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,200
for more than one ktm server test

262
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
so we need to conquer the dilemma

263
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
how to argue the normal ktm security for

264
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
the above

265
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
basic construction

266
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
here we need to introduce the introduce

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
and leverage

268
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
the correlated source security of

269
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
extractor

270
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
next let me first introduce the

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
definition of this required property

272
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
and then see how to employ it to achieve

273
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,399
kdm

274
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,839
security more formally we see

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
with respect to a function class f

276
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
if for any function f i in

277
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
big fund b class f

278
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
the outputs of structure function are

279
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,120
statistically close to uniform

280
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
even the source of extraction has been

281
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
applied many different functions

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
from f1 to fq where

283
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
q is an unbounded

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,200
polynomial in the security parameter

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,519
with this correlation so security i'm

286
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,399
observing

287
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
the structure of all kdm server tests

288
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,519
we know that if we treat vector x plus a

289
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,560
vector

290
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,959
p i prime as a shift function of

291
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
velocity x

292
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
under the used extruder indeed satisfied

293
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
for a little source security

294
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
with the respiratory shift functions

295
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,959
then thus ktm sabotage

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
should be indistinguishable from the

297
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
below random

298
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
sabotage clearly we started to bypass

299
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,320
the above dilemma for the restricted ktm

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,360
security through using the collision

301
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,399
source security

302
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,279
of the extractor

303
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
thanks to high-level high-level building

304
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
plug

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
we can see it more clearly in particular

306
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,040
with leveraging the quality so security

307
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
of instructor

308
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,800
we can achieve the normal ktm01 security

309
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
furthermore we need to consider how to

310
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,079
instantiate

311
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,279
the required building blocks first we

312
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,320
find that

313
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
patch encryption is already implies of

314
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,600
which

315
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,639
a big hps with three useful additional

316
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,920
structures

317
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,800
second the required extractor can be

318
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240
constructed from

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
tdh or rwe

320
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
now we have obtained academic circle pke

321
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
scheme

322
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,920
from weak hps and extractor however

323
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,200
it is still far away from a desired

324
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,760
target

325
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
optimal information rate so let's

326
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,120
consider

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,279
how to improve information through

328
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,440
further using reusable inspiratory

329
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
and blood cell setting

330
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
first let us analyze the information

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,880
rate

332
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
of our already obtained kdm scheme

333
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
in particular for

334
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,480
such a similar test each information

335
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,880
rate

336
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,399
is a length of mu

337
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
over the loss of a whole server test

338
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
clearly this rate is equivalent to order

339
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,880
one

340
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,560
over the security parameter here we use

341
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,120
w

342
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
to denote the output length of its

343
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,800
charger also

344
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,320
we have thus

345
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
relationships among the

346
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,120
sizes next

347
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,839
i first described the reusable property

348
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,040
of the extractor

349
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,600
and show how to enlarge information from

350
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
it

351
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
generally the reusable property of

352
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
extractor means that

353
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
one source can be repeatedly used for

354
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
many randomness ri

355
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,240
for i is children from one to t

356
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
even in this case the outputs of

357
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
extraction are still

358
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,560
interesting availability from uniform

359
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,760
through using the reusable version of

360
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
instructor the server test can be

361
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
released at this one

362
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,199
in this case information

363
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,560
is a poor approaching 1 over r

364
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,440
over w plus 1 for sufficient large t

365
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,839
thus the information rate in this case

366
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,639
is about 1

367
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,040
over constant which is which is much

368
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
better

369
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
than above 1 over lambda but still far

370
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,199
away from optimal one

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
furthermore we notice that if we're

372
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,560
replacing

373
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,759
the vowel reusable instructor with y in

374
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
block source setting

375
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,480
we can encrypt many more plain text in

376
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,880
one

377
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
server text here the instructor in the

378
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,199
blog source

379
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
settings means that one copy of

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
structure can be repeatedly used for

381
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
different blocks

382
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
of a secret key and

383
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,120
silky bk consists of a different

384
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,360
white key is is used as a block source

385
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
in the computation of instructor

386
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
in this case we noticed that the

387
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
information rate

388
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
becomes wdt over

389
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,560
the whole size of cybertest which is

390
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
approximate to wd

391
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
over r plus wd

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
and this rate is become optimal

393
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,199
if d is larger than is is

394
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
large enough such that size r equals

395
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
small o wd

396
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
up until now we finally get kid in what

397
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
pdm one security with optimal

398
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,320
information rate

399
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,079
in fact we almost obtain one desired kdm

400
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,199
circle pke

401
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,240
scheme instead for two important

402
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,320
parameters for ktm security

403
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
ktm challenge function class and the

404
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,680
number of different

405
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,599
pairs of public keys

406
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,160
next we first focus on the challenge

407
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,919
function class and then consider the

408
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,599
number and bar

409
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,799
in particular from the several form of

410
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,199
different steps of the above analysis

411
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
we can easily know its information rate

412
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,240
and the pdm function classes

413
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
the first function class is a function

414
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,480
as a form function from z b to n to the

415
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,880
mass

416
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
space m the second function class

417
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,799
is the generalized alpha functions from

418
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
z b to n to the

419
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,080
mass space m to t in fact

420
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,559
a file functions are general enough

421
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,840
since it can be

422
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,559
amplified to any boundary size circuit

423
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
through using coupled circuit

424
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,200
however for achieving the optimal

425
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
information rate

426
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
we have to set the shift key in

427
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
block starting and in this case the

428
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
foreign class is the

429
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,000
local fine functions from zb to m prime

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
times e to m to t

431
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
times d where n equals m prime

432
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
times d clearly

433
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
the profile function is weaker than

434
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,640
regular with a fine function

435
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
so we need to consider is it possible to

436
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
further amplify

437
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,559
the logifying function class just as

438
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,840
done for regular file function

439
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
next we consider how to amplify the pro

440
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
plugifying challenge function in the

441
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
case of

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
optimal information rate before this

443
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
the most widely used amplification

444
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
approach is due to our bomb's work in

445
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
euro crypto 2011.

446
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,679
it should be significant to instructive

447
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
administrative to review abraham's

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,640
approach

449
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
and has an essential idea the advantage

450
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
of

451
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
our problems approach is that of

452
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
achieving ktm security

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
for any bounded size circuit however

454
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
is is its disadvantage is that of

455
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,360
leading to serious loss information rate

456
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
so it assumes that we cannot apply

457
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,480
upper bound approach directly

458
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,840
this is because a logo file a function

459
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,720
is weaker than the regular file function

460
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,280
and

461
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
the right user view affects the

462
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
information of all

463
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
pdm circuits scheme so

464
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
next we need to con consider the further

465
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
questions

466
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,280
first how to amplify profile functions

467
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,919
second

468
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,640
how to achieve optimal information rate

469
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
how to bypass this obstacle is all nice

470
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,799
folks fortunately after understanding uh

471
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,000
analysis in

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
our performance work more deeply we find

473
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,480
his essential idea is to encode

474
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,799
the label of global circuit into mass

475
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,760
space

476
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,400
and all schemes satisfy this property

477
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
moreover

478
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
we find that due to special structure of

479
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,039
all masked space

480
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
we can adjust

481
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,360
parameters to offset the laws caused by

482
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
the encoding of governments

483
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
in the encrypted methods so

484
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,360
for all kiddum server pke we can apply

485
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,799
file

486
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,039
or block our file function in a perfect

487
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,720
way

488
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
for many more to use please see your

489
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,919
paper

490
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,640
now after putting all about things

491
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,600
together we can

492
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
killing oneself pke for any boundary

493
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,799
size circuit

494
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,000
with optimal information rate besides

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
all the used building block coming

496
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
stationed from

497
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,720
ddhrw and latitudes

498
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
uh detailed random random structure is

499
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,559
also

500
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
very very interesting and can be found

501
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
in your paper

502
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,320
here we have completed all first result

503
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,080
we can achieve one cycle pke with the

504
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,480
optimal information rate

505
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,039
next we consider how to enlarge the

506
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
number of different public keys

507
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
in order to do this we roughly adopt the

508
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
following three experts

509
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
introduce the notion of b based pke and

510
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,400
easy useful property

511
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,679
second establish security reduction

512
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,080
between ktm-1 security and kidnap

513
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,880
security

514
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,679
with respect to block of fire function

515
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,840
third

516
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,919
installation pe with

517
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,480
reusable a property from tdhrwe

518
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
up until now

519
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,799
we have achieved our sound result kdm

520
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,400
umbra with the information rate

521
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
another detailed detailed construction

522
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,919
can be found

523
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
in your paper

524
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
finally we consider how to generalize or

525
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,919
above result to ibe setting

526
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,240
in order to do this we wrapped up the

527
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
following four steps

528
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
first introduce additional structure for

529
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,960
ib

530
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,679
ibe iv iv-based weak hps

531
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
second introduces the new concept of

532
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,200
on-the-fly

533
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
ktm security for pke third introduce a

534
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,840
new compiler for kdm pke to kdm ibe

535
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,159
fourth set of particular kdm challenge

536
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,760
function class for ibe

537
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
such as the information rate to be

538
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,080
optimal

539
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
the detailed construction can also be

540
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
found in your paper

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,720
thank you for your attentions
