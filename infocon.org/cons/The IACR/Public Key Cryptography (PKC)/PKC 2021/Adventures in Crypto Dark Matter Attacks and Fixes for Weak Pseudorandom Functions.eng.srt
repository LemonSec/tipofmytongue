1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,600
i will talk about adventure

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,640
in crypto dark matter or text and fix

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,120
for weak should random functions

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,599
this is a joint work with zhang chan

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,559
zhang kim

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,960
and jason kim the outline consists of

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
backgrounds our work attack and fix of

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,920
wikipedia

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,320
and folder works should random function

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,279
informally looks like a random function

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,000
and

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
it has a lot of application hmac

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,280
division signature and

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,079
indistinguishability application

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
and block cipher atc and this is

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,160
an important tool in the construction of

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
cryptographic

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
primitives mathematical definition a

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
pseudo-random function

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
is a deterministic kid function

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
it takes input x and produce output

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
and key embedded inside should random

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,000
function

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
need to be efficiently computable

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
and its input and output behavior

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,320
is computationally indeed

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,720
indistinguishable

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
from truly random function

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,360
we will focus on a particular relaxation

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720
of shoulder random function

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
namely weak should random function

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,799
weak plap is the same

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
prf except the adversary

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
does not get to make adaptive queries

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
and the adversary only gets to

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
see uniform random evaluation of the

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,680
prf i will talk about brief status of

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
stronger function

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
linear menstrual descent present a

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
quadratic polynomial

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
time learning algorithm for learning h

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
general circuit

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,119
and the classic results by kritanov

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
gave a candidate weak prep with quality

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,759
polynomial time security

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
and a nice construction by benny and

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,480
pablo shows a weak piano which is step

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
3.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
now move to a larger complex class with

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,239
the mode p gate

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,440
where p is prime carboxy no

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
adele shows that no strong prf

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,120
is better than quadri-polynomial

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239
security

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,760
and viola constructs strong prf with

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
polynomial time security

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
and akapia adele construction gives a

58
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,800
weak plf candidate that can be computed

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
in depth 3 with

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
acc class

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
in general htc general with general mode

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,879
m-gate

63
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,160
bonne edda proposed a weak pll that can

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
plausibly

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
have exponential security and simple

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,440
extension

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
of their construction gave a strong prf

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,959
that

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
can be implemented by the 3 circuit in

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
hcc 0.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
our target is a weak prf

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
which has exponential security

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
the paper is exploring crypto

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
documentary

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
exploring crypto documentaries with prf

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
candidates

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
have many contribution first

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
it is a very simple construction

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
they only mix linear computations

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
over different moduli and

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
they have low depth circuit complexity

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
they are first proposed that's two week

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,799
prf candidates

84
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
and also they are their first

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
proposed three strong prf candidates

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
and finally

87
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
they have a platformly

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
exponential security

89
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,680
in the landscape of cryptography we have

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,159
these

91
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
nice mathematical assumptions

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
but they want to make simple

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,358
construction

94
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,600
and they find the modulus mixing

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,399
technique

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
by exploring crypto documentation and

97
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
now

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,040
we adventure crypto documentary

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,600
this will introduce a new direct

100
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
statistical attack

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
using conditional prop probability

102
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
and apply the attack to documenter's

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,520
weak prf candidates

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,360
and braking on alternative weak prf

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
candidates suggested parameter

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,960
with exponentially many samples and also

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
breaking a new weak prf candidate

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
suggested parameter with

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,360
circulant metrics and exponentially many

110
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,760
samples

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,400
[Music]

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
first we will introduce a documented

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
new weak prf candidate before

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,560
the define weak prf define the map

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,919
the map is the function map that

116
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,720
takes an ambient input and simply

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
compute the sum module 3.

118
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
and the secret key is a matrix a which

119
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,720
is chosen

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,639
uniformly at random from m by n matrix

121
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
we compare is very simple they

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
multiply a and input x in modulo 2

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,080
and apply the function map

124
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,280
and they suggest parameter n is

125
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,080
256.

126
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,759
they also propose alternative weak prf

127
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,479
candidate

128
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,160
for two-party computation the secret key

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
is n bit vector and also

130
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,720
input is ambit vector input x is

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
ambit vector then compute inner product

132
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
on input x and security k

133
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
and then sum of model 2 of the wizard

134
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,840
and

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
model 3 of the result and and then

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
compute module 2. this is very simple

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
construction and also they suggest

138
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
parameter

139
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,080
and is 384

140
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
their parameter selection is uh based on

141
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
bkw attack

142
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,319
bkw attack is an attack for

143
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
fpm problem and this thought i recommend

144
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,880
and is 384 for 128 bit

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
security with 2 to the

146
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
power of 60 bit memory

147
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
however uh vacatable attack do not seem

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,360
to apply

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
to new weak plf candidate

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,319
so they recommend nes 256

151
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440
with analysis of low degree rational

152
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
functions

153
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
our intention is also very simple

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,080
we observe that rig prf

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,360
then if you know product input x

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,720
and secret k secret key k

157
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
has zero one two model six then

158
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
with prf produced zero and also

159
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
uh if you know product xnk

160
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
has three four five one in module six

161
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
then weak prf produce one

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,919
we think that input of weak prf

163
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
can be considered as modulo 6

164
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
but x is uniformly chosen

165
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,479
ambit not uniform uniform

166
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,599
in genetic space

167
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,800
then it may give a statistical weakness

168
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
assume that inner products and k

169
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
is sum of x 1 x 2 x

170
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
x h where h is the number of ones

171
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,120
of secret k k then

172
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
we compare it uh the output of weak prf

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
is determined by the number of 1

174
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
out of x1 x2 xh

175
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
our key idea is sum of combination

176
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,839
we define f which input n and t

177
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
and its sum the combination

178
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
skipped by t when t

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
is 2 or 3 we can easily compute the

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
value

181
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
then how about k we can present

182
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,600
the value of f by this root of unity

183
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
when f is divided by 2 to the power of n

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,320
it has difference to 1 out of t

185
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
the difference is determined by the

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
absolute value of

187
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,760
1 plus w out of 2

188
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
which is equal to cosine

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,240
pi out of t

190
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
when t is six it is square root of

191
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
root square root three out of two

192
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
now we will talk about our attack for

193
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,080
alternative weak prf candidate let h

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,000
be the number of ones the security k

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,080
then we compute conditional probability

196
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
element j of the vector x is zero

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,800
when the output of weak prf is zero

198
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,480
then if element j of vector k

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
is zero then elements j of vector x

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
does not affect the output of big prf

201
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
because the output is determined by

202
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,959
inner product of input x and

203
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,399
security k therefore

204
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,680
the conditional probability is one half

205
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,240
now if element j of vector k

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
is one uh the conditional probability

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,959
is the fraction of sum of combinations

208
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
during tds computation we can get the

209
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
value of conditional probability

210
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
and they are biased unfortunately

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
when h is 2 modulo 6 the conditional

212
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
probability

213
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
is exactly one half

214
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
but in this case if we choose

215
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,079
two elements of vector x then we get a

216
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,160
biased conditional probability

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
the difference of conditional

218
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,399
probability

219
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
and one half is similar to one out of

220
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
two to the power of h point two one

221
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
the secret key k is drawn uniformly at

222
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,040
random from

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,399
n bit so we can assume

224
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
h is n out of two

225
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
then the difference of conditional

226
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
probability

227
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,320
and one-half is similar to 1

228
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
out of 2 to the power of

229
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,070
n 0.005

230
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,839
[Music]

231
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,600
if the number of samples is rather than

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
2 to the power of 0.21 n

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
we show that we can distinguish

234
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
with pair of candidate samples and

235
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
uniformly random samples

236
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
therefore n must grow

237
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
from 380 to 610

238
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,600
to be robust against our attack for

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,560
128 bit security with exponentially many

240
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,079
samples

241
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
open question uh if the number of

242
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,000
samples

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,160
is polynomial then prove or disprove the

244
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
security of

245
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,639
weak prf candidate and now

246
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,200
we will introduce our attack for new

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,920
weak prf candidate

248
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
we assume that a matrix a is

249
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,399
a circulant matrix because a circular

250
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,360
matrix

251
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,399
key size is reduced n

252
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
power of 2 to the n

253
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
and this is more efficient and the

254
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,600
secret

255
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
uh the security is considered as the

256
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,040
same for

257
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,399
random nutrition a in the paper

258
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,079
let a be the circulate matrix and define

259
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
function map that

260
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
takes an n bit input and simply compute

261
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
the sum modulus 3.

262
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,040
let h be the number of 1 out of a

263
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
base vector of matrix a

264
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
then we observe a new property

265
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
of the number of 1. when we multiply

266
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,639
a vector consisting of only one by

267
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,760
matrix a

268
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,959
then the result is a vector consisting

269
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,399
of only h

270
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,279
because a is a circular matrix

271
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,880
when we multiply a vector consists of

272
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
only one by a vector a times x

273
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
where x is an input

274
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,959
then the result is h times h x

275
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,480
where h x is the number one out of

276
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,360
vector x thus

277
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
if the number of one out of

278
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,639
vector x is even then

279
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,440
eight times the num the number of one

280
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
out of a vector

281
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
a times a times x is also

282
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,560
even the parity of the number of

283
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,839
one out of eight times x

284
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,399
is preserved if the number of

285
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,120
1 out of vector x is even

286
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,199
and now we observe weak prf

287
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,680
which is map of x times x

288
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
if we get samples who have

289
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,160
even number of ones it may

290
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,600
give statistical distance

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,959
the number of ones in a times x is even

292
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,000
if hx is even

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
let y be a random vector in

294
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,000
m bit whose number of ones is even

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
the following conditional probability is

296
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,279
also

297
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,120
a fraction of sum of combinations

298
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
and the difference of conditional

299
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,639
probability

300
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,079
and one third is similar to 1 out of 2

301
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,959
to the power of

302
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,600
0.21 n and we need

303
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
a heuristic assumption

304
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,240
a times x acts like a

305
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
random vector y

306
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
if the heuristic assumption holds that

307
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
the difference of the following

308
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
conditional probability

309
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
and one third is similar to

310
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,880
1 out of 2 to the power

311
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,880
0.21 n

312
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,839
we verify the assumption by experimental

313
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
results now

314
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,440
let's see experimental results

315
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
we draw a trend line according to

316
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,720
various

317
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
n the y axis is the logarithm

318
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,920
of a value p inverse the logarithmic

319
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,040
trend line is

320
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
almost the same as our expectation

321
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,639
for 7n so our assumption is valid

322
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,920
then how to fix to prevent our attack

323
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,040
in alternative weak prf case just

324
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
increase the number of ones in secret

325
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
key k

326
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,079
our attack only depends on the number of

327
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,519
ones in k

328
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,480
so change the distribution of secret

329
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,199
keys

330
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,199
uniform distribution to the vector whose

331
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,759
number of

332
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,160
ones is 305

333
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,520
and 384 combination 305

334
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
is large enough to prevent the brute

335
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,439
force attack

336
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,559
so our fix do not have to change in

337
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,599
in new weak prf case to prevent our

338
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,959
attack

339
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,679
we break the circular metric structure

340
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,199
choose two random vectors and combine

341
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,840
half circular matrix of random vectors

342
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
this this fixation

343
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,360
preserves the advantages of the

344
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
circulant matrix

345
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,720
and also prevent our attack

346
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
in our experimental resource weak prfs

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,559
have similar security when using

348
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,520
semicircular

349
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,039
metrics and random metrics in both

350
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,080
case it is significantly safer

351
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,559
than circulant metrics

352
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,000
first further work is prove or disprove

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
of the security weak prx when

354
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
polynomially many samples are given

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
our attack use exponentially many

356
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
samples

357
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
so it do not have to change parameters

358
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,200
in practical case

359
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,440
but our attack only uses statistical

360
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
weakness of weak pianos thus

361
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,280
if someone combined the algebraic

362
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
property

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
and our observation it could be a more

364
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
effective

365
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
attack second for the work is

366
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
a crypto analysis a weak prf with

367
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,160
full random matrix a since

368
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
our method is limited to circulant

369
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
metrics

370
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
so find a whole new method

371
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
for full random case

372
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,120
