1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
i will talk about kdm security for the

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,440
honeysuckle commons transformations in

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
qrom

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,519
i'm filiki from ntt

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,160
this is a joint work with leo nishmaki

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,400
from ntt

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
key dependent message security or kdm

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,279
security for short is a security notion

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,920
that captures situations where an

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
adversary can get a cipher text of

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
secret keys

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
such situations naturally occur in many

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
practical crypto systems

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
such as anonymous credentials formal

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
methods and hard disk encryptions

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
recently kdm security found an

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
application also in quantum crypto

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
jan showed that ktm security can be used

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
to realize delegation of quantum

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,839
computation

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
this is the definition of kdm security

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
it is defined by using security

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
experiment between the challenger and

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
then adversary

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,880
in this experiment

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,520
the adversary can make academic query

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,680
consisting of two functions f0 and f1

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119
for this query

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,360
the challenger returns a ciphertext of

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,040
fb of sk

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
depending on the value of the challenge

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
bit b

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,000
then if any polynomial time adversary

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,320
cannot guess the challenge bit b

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
correctly significantly better than

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,920
random guessing

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
we say that an encryption scheme is kdm

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,560
secure

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
we can define kdmcca security by

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
allowing the adversary to make

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
decryption queries

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
ktm security in multi-key setting can be

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
defined similarly

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,680
in this work we tackle the following

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
question

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
do existing practical ncpa or cca secure

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
pk schemes satisfy ktm security in the

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
qram

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
especially

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
for practical schemes

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
we focus on fujisakio common

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
transformations f4

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
and we ask whether for transformation

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
satisfy ktm security in the qram without

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
square root security loss

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
next

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
i will review

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
effort transformations and the square

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,640
root security loss problem in the qram

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,120
as shown by hindsight 12 the 4

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
transformations can be decomposed into

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
two transformations t and u

63
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
t converts an ncpa secure pk scheme into

64
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,239
a one-way cpa secure deterministic pk

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,200
scheme

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
by using a random oracle

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
you combat a one-way cpa secure

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,319
deterministic pk scheme into an ncca

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
secure cam

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
by using a random oracle

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,279
three variants of u have been considered

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
then i will talk about the square root

73
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
loss problem in the q rom

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
in the q rom many security proofs suffer

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
from square root loss

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,599
this is because in the qram

77
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
we need to use one way to hiding lemma

78
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,120
proposed by unlu to justify random

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
oracle programmings

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
roughly speaking one way to hiding lemma

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
says that there exists an extractor d

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
such that the advantage gap caused by

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,400
random oracle programming can be bounded

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,519
by square root of the probability that d

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
extracts the programmed point s

86
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,519
square root loss requires much stronger

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
security parameters for building blocks

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,519
to achieve reasonable security level

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,879
as a result

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,439
it significantly degrades the efficiency

91
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
of cryptographic primitives

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
so we need to avoid square root loss

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
especially when we study practical

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,798
schemes

95
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
reason three

96
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,639
an improved variant of one way to hiding

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,960
limbaugh was proposed

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
by using it

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
cooked it 12 showed that in cca security

100
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
of a4 transformation can be proved

101
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
without square root loss

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
however its applicability is somewhat

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
limited

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
especially it is not clear whether we

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
can use it

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
in the context of kdm security due to

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
the circularity issue as we explained

108
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,799
later

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
this is our results

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
we show the following two results

111
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,440
we showed that a pk scheme obtained by

112
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
combining any variant of f4 cam with one

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
timepad as them satisfies kdmcpa

114
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,880
security in the qram without square root

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
loss

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
we also show that a pk scheme obtained

117
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
by combining a single variant of f4 cam

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,840
with one time pattern marked as them

119
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
satisfies ktm cca security in the qram

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
without square root loss

121
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,479
concretely for the first result

122
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
we can use t together with variance of u

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
called u bot and u naught part

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
for the second result

125
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
we can use t together with a variant of

126
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,479
u called u but key conformation

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,320
also for the second result

128
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
we require mild injectivity assumption

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
for the underlying in the cpa secure pk

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
scheme

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
this additional requirement is the same

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
as that required in previous works use

133
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
double-sided 2 hiding lemma to improve

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
in cca security of f4 transformations

135
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,520
next

136
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
i will talk about technical overview of

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
this work

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,440
for simplicity i will focus on kdm cpa

139
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
security

140
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
binder etwa showed that the one-way cpa

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
security of t can be reduced to the in

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
the cpa security of the underlying pk

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,479
scheme

144
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
without square root loss

145
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,039
also cooked it will show that the ncca

146
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
security of you can be reduced to the

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
one-way cpa security

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
of the underlying deterministic pk

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
scheme

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
without square root loss

151
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
by using double sided language to hiding

152
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
lemma

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
our goal is achieved if we can reduce

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,240
the kdm cpa security of u plus one time

155
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
path construction to the one-way cpa

156
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,680
security of the underlying deterministic

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
pk scheme without square root loss by

158
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
using double-sided one-way to hiding

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,720
lemma similarly to cooked etw

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,880
however

161
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,039
we found that such a reduction seems

162
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
difficult

163
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
more specifically

164
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
we found that it is difficult to amplify

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
non-kdm security into ktm security

166
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
without square root loss by using

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
double-sided one-way to hiding lemma

168
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,039
due to the circularity issue

169
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,240
essentially

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
we found that the double-sided property

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
conflicts with the secularity issue in

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
kdm security

173
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,199
we solve this issue and obtain our

174
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,759
result as follows

175
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,960
first

176
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
we show that the kdmcpa security of u

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,720
plus one time path construction can be

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
reduced to the ktm one-way security of

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
the underlying deterministic pk scheme

180
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
without square root loss

181
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
namely by using u

182
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,199
we perform amplification from one way

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
security to insecurity for kdm

184
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
not amplification from non-ktm security

185
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
to kdem security

186
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,360
in this case

187
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
we can solve the circularity issue and

188
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
use double sided one way to hide in

189
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
grammar to avoid square root loss

190
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,360
then

191
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,679
we introduce a variant of t we call thk

192
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,160
and we show that the ktm one-way

193
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,720
security of thkg can be reduced to the

194
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600
ncpa security of the underlying pk

195
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,480
scheme

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
without square root loss

197
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
namely by using thk

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
we amplify non-ktm security to ktm

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
security once downgrading into security

200
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
to one-way security

201
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
if our goal is one-way security starting

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,120
from in the security

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,839
we can avoid square root loss by using

204
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
single-sided one-way to hiding lemma

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
called semi-classical one way to hide in

206
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,920
grammar proposed by ambiance at one

207
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
thus there is no difficulty due to the

208
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
circularity issue in this step

209
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
since we use single-sided translation

210
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,839
hiding grammar not double-sided one

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
finally we showed that the ktm cpa

212
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
security of the combination of th kg and

213
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
u implies the ktm cpa security of the

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
combination of t and u

215
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
that is a 4 transformation with

216
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,640
essentially no security loss

217
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
by combining these we can obtain our

218
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,760
result

219
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
in the rest of my talk i will focus on

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,079
our main technical contribution

221
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,600
concretely

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
first i will talk about the difficulty

223
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
of amplifying non-ktm security to ktm

224
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
security by using double-sided one-way

225
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
to hiding lemma

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
then i will explain that

227
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
on the other hand we can amplify one-way

228
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
security to in security for ktm security

229
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
without square root loss by using sided

230
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
one-way to hiding grammar

231
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
before talking about technical details

232
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
i will briefly introduce you plus

233
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
one-time part construction and it's

234
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,200
simplified kdm security we will consider

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
in the following

236
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
ups one time path construction is a

237
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
simple hybrid encryption construction

238
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
where the cam is a deterministic pk

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
scheme and them is one time part using

240
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,399
random oracle as described in the slide

241
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,279
then

242
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,920
we consider a simplified kdm security

243
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,800
for this construction that states that

244
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
encryptions of f0sk and f1 of sk are

245
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
indistinguishable for two fixed

246
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,560
functions f0 and f1

247
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,040
to see the aforementioned difficulty

248
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,360
i will first explain how we proved the

249
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
ktm security of u plus one time path in

250
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
the crash color rom

251
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
intuitively u plus one time part

252
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,640
satisfies ktm security since security is

253
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
not an issue

254
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
due to the uniformity of output of the

255
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
random oracle h

256
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
in the classical rom

257
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
we can easily prove that this intuition

258
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,040
is correct as follows

259
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,200
we start with the original security

260
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
experiment where an adversary is given

261
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
the ciphertext c

262
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
which is an encryption of fb of sk

263
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
and as a random coin s described in the

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
slide

265
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
also in this experiment

266
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
the adversary can get access to the

267
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
random oracle age

268
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
there is a circularity in this

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,240
experiment

270
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,600
then

271
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,399
we define a modified security experiment

272
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,200
where the random oracle h is modified

273
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
into a random oracle v

274
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
so that there is no circularity

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
this is possible by programming the

276
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,279
output of v on input s to be a uniformly

277
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,720
random value that is independent of h s

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
by using a tool called difference lemma

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,959
we can bound the advantage gap caused by

280
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,279
this random oracle programming by the

281
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,320
probability that the adversary queries

282
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,040
the

283
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
programmed point s to the modified

284
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
random oracle b

285
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,600
what is important here is that

286
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
the right hand side probability of this

287
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,959
inequality is with respect to the

288
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,439
experiment where there is no circularity

289
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,560
roughly speaking

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
probabilities with respect to the

291
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,440
experiment where there is no circularity

292
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
can be bounded by using the one-way cpa

293
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,480
security of the deterministic pk scheme

294
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,120
this means that the kdm security of u

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,079
plus one time path can be reduced to the

296
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,560
one-way cpa security of the

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,040
deterministic pk scheme in the crash

298
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
card rom

299
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
of course this reduction does not incur

300
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
square root loss

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
we now move on to the curum case

302
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,440
especially we try to translate the proof

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,160
in the classical rom i just explained

304
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,519
into that in the q rom

305
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,880
in the q rom

306
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
we cannot use the difference lemma due

307
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,519
to the following reason

308
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
in the q rom

309
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,440
an anniversary can get access to the

310
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
random oracle in superposition

311
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
so the event that an adversary queries

312
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,839
some input to the random oracle is not

313
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
well defined

314
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
such in the queue rom

315
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
to justify random oracle programming

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,399
we use one way to hiding grammar

317
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,240
we have two variants

318
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
the first one is single-sided one-way to

319
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,639
hiding lambda

320
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,040
it guarantees that there exists an

321
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,399
extracted d

322
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
such that the advantage gap caused by

323
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,959
the random oracle programming can be

324
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,440
bounded by square root of the

325
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
probability that the extractor d

326
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
extracts the programmed point

327
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
getting access to the programmed random

328
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
oracle

329
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
the other one is double sided tone way

330
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
to hiding lemma

331
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
it guarantees that there exists an

332
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
extractor d

333
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,079
such that the advantage gap caused by

334
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
the random oracle programming can be

335
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,480
bounded by the probability that the

336
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,040
extractor d extracts the programmed

337
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,920
point

338
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
getting access to both pre-programmed

339
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
and post-programmed random oracles

340
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
we see that to avoid square root loss we

341
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
need to use double-sided wrong way to

342
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,639
hiding lemma to justify random oracle

343
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,199
programmings

344
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
however

345
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
it is not straightforward to use the

346
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
double sided one way too hiding dilemma

347
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
as an alternative of difference limba

348
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
in the proof of kdm security due to the

349
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,279
circularity issue

350
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,440
suppose similarly to the classical rom

351
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
case we start from the original

352
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,560
experiment where there is a circularity

353
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
and consider a modified experiment where

354
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
the random oracle h is programmed into v

355
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
so that there is no circularity

356
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,920
using double-sided one-way to hiding

357
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
lambda

358
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
the advantage gap caused by this random

359
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,240
oracle programming can be bounded by the

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,040
probability that some extracted d

361
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,680
extracts the programmed point s

362
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,320
getting access to both random oracles h

363
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,639
and p

364
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
however

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
differently from the classical rom case

366
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
the right hand side probability of

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,079
inequality

368
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,639
is with respect to an experiment where

369
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
there is circularity

370
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
if d can get access to only the random

371
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
oracle v

372
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,519
there is no circularity

373
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,560
however

374
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
they can get access to the random oracle

375
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
h2

376
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,399
h and z together forms a circularity as

377
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,519
original experiment

378
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
roughly speaking

379
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
the probability with respect to the

380
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
experiment with circularity cannot be

381
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,079
bounded by the one-way cpa security

382
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,640
of the deterministic pk scheme

383
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,199
thus we cannot complete the proof in the

384
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,839
qrm case

385
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,039
in summary

386
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
in the crash column

387
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,599
case

388
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
we decompose the adversary's advantage

389
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
into probabilities with respect to

390
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,839
experiments with no circularity and we

391
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
complete proof

392
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,240
by bounding those probabilities using

393
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,640
the one-way cpa security of the

394
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
deterministic pk scheme

395
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
on the other hand

396
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
in the queue rom

397
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
if we use double-sided one-way to hiding

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
lemma to avoid square root loss it seems

399
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,080
difficult to follow such a strategy

400
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,480
this is the difficulty for reducing the

401
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,320
kdm security of u plus one time path to

402
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
the one-way cpu security of the data

403
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,160
music pk scheme without square root loss

404
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
thus

405
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
as stated before

406
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
in u plus one time but construction

407
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
we focus on amplification from one-way

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
security to in the security for kdm

409
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,160
security

410
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
not amplification from non-ktm security

411
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
to kdm security

412
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
more precisely we showed that the kdm

413
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
security of u press one time path can be

414
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
reduced to the ktm one-way security of

415
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,080
the deterministic pk scheme without

416
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,879
square root loss

417
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
in fact

418
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
if the deterministic pk scheme satisfies

419
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
ktm one-way security

420
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
we can bound the right-hand side

421
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
probability of this inequality obtained

422
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
by applying double-sided one-way to

423
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
hiding lambda and we can complete the

424
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,440
entire proof without square root loss

425
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,960
let's see how to do this

426
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
we show that successful reconstructor d

427
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
can be used to break the kdm one-way

428
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
security of the deterministic pk scheme

429
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
more precisely we show that it can be

430
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,440
used to compute g of s k from an

431
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
encryption of g of s k

432
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,520
where g is a function that outputs s

433
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
or x on input x

434
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
towards this goal

435
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,480
we gradually change the view of the

436
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
extractor d

437
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
we focus on the input cipher x z and the

438
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,799
random oracle h since they form the

439
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
circularity

440
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
we first change c and h into z prime and

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,720
h prime respectively as described in the

442
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,039
slide

443
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,200
this is a simple change of variables

444
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
concretely

445
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
we replace h s with u x or f b of s k

446
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
for uniformly random u

447
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,520
and we replace s with s x or s k that is

448
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,159
g of s k

449
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
since u and s are uniformly at random

450
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,159
the distribution of z prime and h prime

451
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,840
is exactly the same as that of z and h

452
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
according to this change what we have to

453
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
estimate is now the probability that d

454
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
outputs g of s k

455
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
next we define x b hat x as a function

456
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,080
that outputs x b of x x or s

457
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
then

458
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
we further change the random oracle h

459
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
prime into h2 prime as described in the

460
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
slide

461
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,320
from the correctness of the

462
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
deterministic pk scheme

463
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
without negligible probability

464
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
the if condition in h2 prime is

465
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,760
satisfied by only g of sk

466
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,600
also we can check that given g of sk as

467
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
an input

468
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,039
h2 prime outputs ux or x b of s k

469
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,960
that is h prime g of s k

470
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
from the definition of the function f b

471
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,000
hat

472
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
such h prime and h 2 prime are in fact

473
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,840
functionally equivalent

474
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
now the view of d

475
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
that is c prime and h2 prime can be

476
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,720
simulated from an encryption of g of sk

477
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
by the deterministic pk scheme

478
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,520
also successful extractor d outputs a g

479
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,799
of s k from them

480
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,440
this means that successful d can be used

481
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
to break k d and one way security of the

482
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
deterministic pk scheme

483
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
i explained that the ktm security of u

484
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,200
plus one time path can be reduced to

485
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
the kdm one-way security of the

486
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
deterministic pk scheme without square

487
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
root loss by using double sided one way

488
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
to hide in glamour

489
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
as stated before

490
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,760
it is enough in order to prove the ktm

491
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
security of f4 transformation

492
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
without square root loss

493
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
for the remaining parts please see our

494
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,760
paper

495
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
finally

496
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,559
i will make some remarks on the

497
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,039
technical details i explained in this

498
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,400
talk

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
first

500
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
i focused on simplified setting where

501
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,440
there is only a single ktm function pair

502
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
and it is fixed beforehand

503
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,880
but in the actual proof we have to deal

504
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
with multiple gallium function pairs

505
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
adaptively chosen by an adversary

506
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
to handle this issue

507
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
we use adaptive reprogramming technique

508
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,280
for the qram proposed by undo

509
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,000
also in this talk i focused on the

510
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,559
setting where there is only a single key

511
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,520
pair

512
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
but in the actual proof

513
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,679
we consider setting where there are

514
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,840
multiple key pairs

515
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
to handle this issue

516
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,080
we introduce a security notion we call

517
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,799
seed dependent message one-way security

518
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,000
for deterministic pk schemes and use it

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,679
instead of kdm one-way security

520
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
finally the technique i explained in

521
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
this talk can be used to prove the ktm

522
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,679
cca security of f4 transformation

523
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,559
without square root loss

524
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,400
our technique can be successfully

525
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,279
combined with proof technique used by

526
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,840
the previous works showed in the cca

527
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,240
security of effort transformation

528
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,559
without square root loss by using

529
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,000
double-sided one-way to hiding lemma

530
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
this is the end of my talk thank you for

531
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,159
your attention
