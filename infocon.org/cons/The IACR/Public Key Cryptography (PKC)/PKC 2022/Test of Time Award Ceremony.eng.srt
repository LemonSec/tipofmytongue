1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,520
hi everyone uh so i'm going to hanaoka

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
from chair of this pkc

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,040
and

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
uh let's start the summary of the pkct

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
the test of time hours

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
so

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,279
so at uh as with other iscl

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,160
international conferences uh pkc also

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
presents the test of time hours

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
uh there are based on the number of

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
citations and other factors are the pkc

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,480
test of time hours is selected from the

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
papers presented at pkc more than

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
15 years ago

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,800
in accordance with our

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
regulations

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,000

pick is sorry

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
so the the pkc tlt committee is composed

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
of the pkc program chair and the

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
steering committee members

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,360
so this is our members shown on this

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
flight

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,039
so the members are

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,799
go to hanoka myself again yes

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159
so this year uh we selected uh two

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
papers

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
so now i i am going to announce uh these

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
two papers

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
so p please uh

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
please be uh prepared to press the up

34
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,159
close button on the zoom reaction

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
buttons please

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
so the the uh first uh the the first tlt

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
our paper

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
is a password-based authenticated key

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
exchange in the three-party setting from

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
pkc 2005 uh

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,960
the authors uh share abdarah

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
so this paper is one of the seminal

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
papers in the area of password

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
authenticator key exchange and

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
this result is widely used uh for

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
example or in mutual device

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
authentication in the or iot environment

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
and

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,599
so although the

50
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,400
uh

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
test of time out uh is decided not based

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,720
on story on the number of citations uh

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
this paper has been uh concentrated

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,319
constantly

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,280
cited

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
immediately after the publication and

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,560
more frequently recently as you can see

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
in this slide

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
so such paper is truly worthy of

60
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,959
the

61
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
test of time hours uh congratulations

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,800
so we are really pretty sorry for the

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,599
late hour in europe uh but i would like

64
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
to ask the authors to give a short

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
speech about the award

66
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
so

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
can i ask the

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
abdarah sensei first

69
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
no

70
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
so then uh

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,840
so can give your speech hooks and say

72
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
so thank you very much

73
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,440
um

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,040
so uh i would like to thank my co-author

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
and the committee for

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,959
having

77
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
given the award to this paper

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,239
um

79
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,319
so the i think uh password-based

80
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,799
key change is very interesting and now

81
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
that the patents are

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
expired

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,200
so we see a more and more

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
opaque scheme in the

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
in security product and nowadays i'm

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
working on the security of their

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,478
implementation and so i think

88
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,240
this is great

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,919
protocols and

90
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,040
the security of now to be analyzed

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
against such adversaries also

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
thank you very much okay thank you very

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,639
much

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,520
so

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
oh then can give your uh social speech

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
uh transfers and say

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
yeah so first i would like to thank the

receive this test of tower award for for

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
that paper and peck and

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,479
indeed bake

102
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
was a very active area at that time with

103
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
both many theoretical and more practice

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
oriented papers and it was very excited

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
to be part of this venture and i enjoyed

106
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,639
a lot working on this topic which is

107
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
also still quiet relevant and eventually

108

have both moved away from ens and i'm

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840

let's move to the uh the

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,680
rpkc 2022 tlt our paper 2.

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,639
so the second available paper

127
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,880
uh it's

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,319
a curve

129
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
two five five one nine new divi helmet

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,639
speed record on pkc 2006

131
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,160
uh the also is daniel j feinstein

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
so this paper is a major contribution to

133
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
the implementation of secure and high

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
skill lp curve cryptography which is

135
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
widely used in practice

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
uh in a variety of practical systems

137
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
so this paper has also been cited uh

138
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,120
what frequency

139
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
especially in the recent

140
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
time

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,400
period so this paper is truly deserving

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
of the pkc test of time hours uh

143
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,520
congratulations

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759

honor to receive this award um but i

152
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
want to emphasize that this paper

153
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,680
it's not living in a vacuum this is

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
something where the paper is building on

155
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
a huge amount of previous work from lots

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
of people and also the the paper

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,479
benefited a ton from subsequent work

158
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,560
from from a lot of people i mean people

159
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
were

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,280
showing how to to use it in various

161
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,800
applications and building on it in

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,759
various ways and variations of it and um

163
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
this is something which uh i mean

164
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,400
it got a lot of extra citations for the

165
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
paper but it's really a big team effort

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
um i i won't say a lot about the details

167
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
because i actually gave a whole talk

168
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,879
about the contacts previous stuff and

169
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
subsequent stuff and

170
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
if you're interested in that then

171
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
the slides and audio are online that was

172
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
a talk from pkc 2016 called the first 10

173
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,639
