uh to have an overview

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
of the first 25 years pkc

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,280
i'm so happy to see you all virtually

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,439
hopefully next year we can see you all

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
in person

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
um

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,119
so my presentation talk will be

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
will be short i think

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,439
um

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,160
i'll give you a very high level overview

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
of what happened in the past 25 years

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
of the pkc conference okay looks like he

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
had trouble with moving the slides okay

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
that's good so here's the outline of my

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
uh presentation

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
so i'll give you some background

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,000
information about how the conference pkc

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
conference was

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
established

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
and i'll spend some time talk about what

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
were the goals we had at the time we

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,720
uh

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
established the uh

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
the conference

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,280
and then we have overview of the major

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,599
milestones of the conferences of the

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
past 25 years

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,599
and finally

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,160
i'd like to have a quick

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,000
personal view about what

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,560
pkc might head towards down the road in

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
the future

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
so

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,159
to talk about a pkc uh

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,519
we have to go back to uh

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
26 years back in 1997.

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
at the time was i was spending one year

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
uh

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
at professor hideki imai's lab

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,840
at tokyo university

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
um

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
i had a great time there and i met a lot

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,879
of friends attended a lot of conference

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,680
in korea as you can see uh

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
bradley

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
was one time a short time visitors

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
of the lab as well

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
and

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
while meeting all the people you know

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,879
talking

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,080
to various researchers about you know

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
research in the futures or pkc

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
will realize that

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
uh in 97

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
a year before that was the 20th

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
anniversary of t.t hellman's

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,920
in the most important paper the new

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
directions in cryptography and then we

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
also realized that the following year

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
1998

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,599
the two of the the papers important

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
papers the alice the paper and the

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
mercury's powder

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
would also turn 20.

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,639
and if we look at all these conferences

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,839
in

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,280
security in cryptography

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
we couldn't find

114
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,120
anyone which

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
was dedicated to a private key or

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,479
cryptography

117
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
so we had this idea maybe we should

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,560
establish one

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
we talked to you know a lot of people

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,360
various people and the feedback was

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
positive

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
and in fact some of the uh you know the

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
uh friends gave us uh

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
a really uh

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
you know strong support

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
they realized that they although agreed

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
it was a great idea to have a conference

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
like this

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
so uh

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
we started work on that

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,759
while

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
trying to get some funding support for

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
the food conference we also

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
look into what what are the goals we try

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
to achieve

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
uh eventually we narrowed down two

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
simple goals

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,560
number one is that it won't emphasize

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
uh the importance of both the research

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,400
and also practical application of the

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
conference

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,719
so

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
that's number one number two is to uh we

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
want to make sure that is international

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
conference and it will

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
rotate around the globe

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,919
and

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
so it initially will focus on basically

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
three larger

150
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,639
you know

151
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,800
geographic areas

152
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
asia pacific uh europe and uh north and

153
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
south america

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,479
and

155
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
we had this idea of rotating this

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
conference globally around these three

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,840
larger geographical

158
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,520
regions and that's pretty much that has

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
been like that in the last 25 years

160
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
and

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,120
we also realize the importance of

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
fostering research in

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
some of the less developed areas so the

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
idea is to uh

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
maybe insert

166
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
some of the uh less represented areas

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,199
every few years

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
uh we'll be trying to do this in the

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,440
last you know 25 years

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
the

171
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
that's basically that's the goal the two

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
very simple goals

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,520
and once this is done we you know work

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
hard to secure fundings and then

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
uh invite

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
you know some of the important

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
contributors

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,479
uh eventually we will be able to secure

179
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,960
uh you know four uh invited

180
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,000
the talks so it's on this slide

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
the first one was by uh

182
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
franco and the young the second was

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,840
isasky

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
third one's araki

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
and his colleague is soto

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
and uh

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,319
and finally jacques stern

188
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
also joined us as a special guest

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,080
uh so we we had four uh invited talks

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
plus contributed our papers

191
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,479
um

192
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
the conference was eventually the uh the

193
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,880
proceedings were published by springer

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,800
so you see the picture of the first

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
first conference

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
after the first one

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
we immediately started work on the

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
second one

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
uh 99

200
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,639
and

201
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
we realized that

202
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,080
even though our goal was to make it uh

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,960
you know

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
mobile right rotating around the globe

205
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,000
but

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
it needs some you know footy in the

207
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,560
first place so we decided to have the

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
second round also in japan

209
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
uh i still remember that was in kamakura

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,400
i think

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
i had a second one and then

212
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
third one we felt like it was ready to

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
go outside of japan and

214
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
so we had a studio one in uh in

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
australia melbourne

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
uh while in melbourne we

217
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
uh established the first the steering

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
committee

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
so the committee has been

220
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
undergoing some changes the membership

221
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
has changed over the years but you see

222
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,039
the current members about

223
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
10 members right now

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
and

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
we've been pretty active we have regular

226
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
communications

227
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,600
uh we

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
we

229
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,080
solicited you know uh

230
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,519
potential uh you know the hosts for

231
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
next conferences

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,200
and every year at pkc conference we

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
have our annual student committee

234
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
meetings in fact this year's we have

235
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
we'll have one this coming friday

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
we have our

237
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,399
terms of references

238
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,959
and we have our represent

239
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
representative on the isc board of

240
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
directors so the model i feel like it's

241
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
been pretty successful and my

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
understanding that

243
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,480
is ircr adopted some of the aspects of

244
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
that uh it's it's bylaw

245
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
and also

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
our practice has been

247
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
adopted by some of the other conferences

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880

249
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560

pkco3 was in miami

283
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,160
uh that that was also considered a

284
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
pivotal year because

285
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
uh from

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720

297
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,480
as you can see the number of

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
participants kind of you know has some

299
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
fluctuation but overall i would say it

300
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,279
was pretty healthy at the beginning and

301
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,760
there's some challenging litter and then

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
you know uh numbers started coming back

303
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
again

304
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
a couple of pictures uh

305
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,639
and

309
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
pkco5 was a switzerland i still remember

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
very impressive

315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,279
and followed by uh

316
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360

pkc is looting really narrow

324
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
as you can see the numbers are getting

325
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
you know picking up again

326
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
right

327
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
and the number of

328
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
papers

329
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,000
received

330
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
definitely has been increasing you know

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
before

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,920
this group of conferences

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279

336
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
and then the

337
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
19

349
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
in beijing

350
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
that was the last in-person tkc

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,399
conferences

352
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,560
and then followed by three

353
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
virtual pkc conferences including this

354
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,600
one

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
as you can see the number of

356
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
attendees are going up again

357
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
maybe because of the voucher

358
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
and the

359
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
number of submissions pretty pretty

360
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
healthy

361
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
or

362
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,120
pretty high you know as high as 180

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
so that that's the uh

364
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
that's very like a high-level view of

365
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
the pkc company over the past 25 years

366
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,000
so another picture

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,199
the last in-person tkc conference

368
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,760
in beijing

369
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
um

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
this also reminds me some interesting

371
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,120
experience i had back in uh 18 in rio

372
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,880
we had a half day

373
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,760
timer off so you know everybody some

374
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
tour i

375
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,639
hoped on this little bus for a tour

376
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
and

377
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
i noticed that the

378
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,680
the tour guide

379
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
had some trouble with his smartphone and

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
uh

381
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
he told me he had this problem

382
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
for a couple of days he didn't work very

383
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,480
well and

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
i noticed that his phone was the same as

385
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
my phone so i said like maybe i could

386
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
help you

387
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,880
so i

388
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
spent a few minutes to helping fix the

389
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,959
problem and they were so happy and

390
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
allowed me sitting

391
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
in the front row so i had the best of

392
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,160
you

393
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
for that for that day

394
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
um

395
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,079
that was a very uh mirror experience for

396
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
me

397
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
so uh a very much high-level view of

398
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,519
milestone

399
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,800
1998 the first time

400
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,560
tkc was started

401
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,600
at

402
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
2000

403
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
going outside of japan was held in

404
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
melbourne australia

405
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,839
and

406
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,720
2003

407
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,240
pkc become

408
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
part of icr

409
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,519
and and then 2009 at workshop

410
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,959
was

411
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
uh changing the conference

412
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,160
so from 2009 pkc became a pkc conference

413
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
as good as getting tkc workshop

414
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
and the first time uh

415
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,839
in south america there was tkc

416
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,720
14

417
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
and

418
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
pkc 19 we introduced the test of time

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
awards so i'll talk a little bit more

420
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,480
about this

421
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,199
so as you can see the schedule for the

422
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
test of time awards

423
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,959
because we started being pkc 19 so there

424
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
were a lot of papers

425
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
uh published prior you know in in the

426
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,040
last

427
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
20 plus years

428
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
accumulated so we have set up this

429
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
scheduled to uh

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
to clear up right the all these all the

431
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
all these other papers

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
so

433
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
in

434
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,639
19 pkc 19

435
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
uh three papers were selected

436
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,079
for the years between

437
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,079
98 to 2001

438
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,079
and

439
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,560
pkc20

440
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,759
selected

441
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
three papers

442
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
uh from uh all the papers published in

443
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,919
1998 to

444
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
2003

445
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,119
and then the following at pkc 21

446
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,079
select the papers

447
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,799
from

448
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,559
2002 to

449
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,839
05

450
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
and this year again two papers selected

451
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
among these four years from pkco4 to

452
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,919
07.

453
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
now from our next year though

454
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
will become

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
kind of regular cycle we were always

456
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,799
looking for

457
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,120
primary focus on three years for example

458
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,600
next year we'll be focusing on pkco6207

459
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
and o8

460
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,799
and select one

461
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,400
paper

462
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
for the tester time award and likewise

463
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
for pkco4

464
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,039
will be

465
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,559
you know uh the pkc 070809

466
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,919
uh selecting one paper and so forth

467
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,679
uh

468
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,080
so that's pretty much about the

469
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
test of time award

470
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,720
and so this is the list of uh all the

471
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
papers

472
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,120
that have been awarded

473
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,919
for the uh test time award so three in

474
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,200
the first year to 19 and 20 had three

475
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
more papers

476
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,840
21 had also three papers and this year

477
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
we have two papers

478
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
these are all excellent papers all of

479
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
them have made

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
important contributions to the

481
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,120
discipline

482
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,760
and of course there are also papers who

483
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,240
that may not have received awards

484
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
they also made a lot of contribution as

485
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,360
well

486
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
so

487
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
i guess based on this you know i i think

488
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,880
it's fair to say that

489
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,679
the two goals we uh

490
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
uh you know

491
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,440
established at the beginning of the

492
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
conference that's the goal number one

493
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,799
that is to

494
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,640
focus on both practical and the

495
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
theoretical side of pkc

496
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
i think it's fair to say that we achieve

497
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,640
the goal number one number two is to

498
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,520
promote research

499
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
globally by

500
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,039
rotating the conference in different

501
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,640
parts of the world

502
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
i i think it's fair to see that we have

503
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
achieved that goals as well

504
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
so in terms of the uh

505
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
following conferences

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
next year the we have a candidate

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
location uh the plan is to have in

508
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
atlanta

509
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,200
uh we have a great team from georgia

510
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
tech

511
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
who uh

512
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
is a process of

513
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
preparing a proposal the hope that that

514
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
will be approved by icr

515
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,919
in the near future and once it's uh

516
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,039
decided we'll make announcement

517
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,840
uh

518
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,559
pkco24

519
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
is going back to europe

520
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
we're actually in the process of

521
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,840
soliciting uh proposals from uh

522
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
uh from interested parties so if anyone

523
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,720
in europe would like to host the uh the

524
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
conference tkc24

525
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
please contact any member of the student

526
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
committee

527
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
now as for

528
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
beyond to if you can see 24

529
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
um

530
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
personally i feel like

531
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
it's a good time to look at you know the

532
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,919
second goal right can we do better

533
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
perhaps you know if you look at the map

534
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
yeah these red dots are the that's where

535
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,159
the conference because they have been

536
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,840
held so far

537
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
and

538
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
and there are a lot of uh you know uh

539
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
places which we haven't

540
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,240
had a pkc yet

541
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
and uh so

542
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
i think it's for the community to really

543
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
think about that if they

544
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,559
the conditions are

545
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
right perhaps we should also consider to

546
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,520
have

547
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
a pkc conference in some of the less

548
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
representative places for example

549
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
you know uh

550
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,039
south

551
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,360
south and south east asia and middle

552
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
east

553
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,440
possibly africa and and so forth

554
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
and surprisingly we haven't had tkc uh

555
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
in canada yet so that would be

556
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
potentially one location as well

557
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,559
uh

558
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
so that's actually very much that's what

559
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,600
what i have it's maybe shorter than the

560
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
plan the time but i'll be happy to

561
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
answer any questions and also

562
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,600
discussions

563
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
and so forth

564
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,400
uh maybe i can stop sharing

565
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
let's be sharing now

566
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
thank you very much we can see our faces

567
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
okay

568
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
so let's talk our speaker

569
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
thank you so

570
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,760
so do you have any questions

571
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,760
so especially the future hosting

572
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,720
of the pkc conference a proposal for

573
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,960
that

574
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,039
i have a question yes yes please

575
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,679
yes um i think i was president of iacr

576
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,240
at the time the pkc started

577
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
yes you were and uh yeah that was a long

578
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,799
time ago

579
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
and um

580
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
you know right after that i think fse

581
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,200
started and then tcc started around 2004

582
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,080
and you know these smaller conferences

583
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
the so-called area conferences were

584
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
starting up at that time

585
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,919
and i think they were designed to solve

586
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,720
a couple of problems one was that they

587
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
needed a cohesive community of people

588
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
interested in the subfield of

589
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
cryptography that could get together

590
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
regularly and talk to each other

591
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,799
but i also think there was there was

592
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,640
tension in the

593
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
the regional conferences that there were

594
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
not enough speaking slots

595
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
and so there were a lot of new people

596
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
getting phds in cryptography they needed

597
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
a place to publish

598
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
and um

599
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
that has continued to be a problem right

600
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
the community has grown

601
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,360
we have more and more papers being

602
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,880
published i'm on this committee to

603
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
review a new

604
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,919
journal right now for iecr

605
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,760
and this is partly a reaction to the

606
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,520
fact that they're just so many papers

607
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,039
being written in cryptography they don't

608
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
have a place to be published

609
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,120
but i wonder from your pr from my

610
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,400
perspective

611
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,559
it feels like the community has

612
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
fragmented a little bit too much

613
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
and i think it's unfortunate that

614
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
you know the the people from tcc don't

615
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
talk to the people from chess for

616
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
example as much as they would have if

617
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,880
they had been attending the same

618
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
conference

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
they might have heard things that give

620
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,760
them ideas for their own field

621
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
to investigate that they wouldn't hear

622
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,600
it because they were at different venues

623
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
and i sort of feel like you know what

624
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,279
i'm curious what do you think of the

625
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
model where we go back to having just

626
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
three conferences a year

627
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
but they're very big conferences and

628
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,240
they have many parallel sessions

629
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,039
so

630
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,480
that way we we would all go to the same

631
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
conference three a year say

632
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,440
they might have i don't know four tracks

633
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
or three packs or something quite a few

634
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
tracks in parallel

635
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,720
and i think the papers you know there

636
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
would be sessions dedicated to public

637
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
key cryptography dedicated to theory

638
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,799
dedicated to fse

639
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,520
i'm curious from the communities

640
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,000
you know that now have a constituency

641
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
tcc pkc

642
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,159
fse

643
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,279
ches

644
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
you know they may want to continue in

645
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
their tradition but i feel like for

646
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
their own benefit it might be good for

647
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
the future of their communities to

648
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,279
actually

649
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
mix a bit more with the broader

650
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
cryptographic community i'm curious if

651
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
you agree with me about that i actually

652
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
i i think you know i i think agree with

653
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,039
you i think you know there's always some

654
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,480
tension there right as you mentioned

655
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
uh of um i think whether we can actually

656
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
completely uh you know turn the clock

657
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,559
back that may be tough maybe what we

658
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
should look at is actually

659
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,000
uh

660
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,240
to

661
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,559
to emphasize the

662
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,200
the the crypto asia crypto europe as the

663
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
primary

664
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,760
venues for us to get together maybe

665
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,559
and

666
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,440
at the same time also allow these uh you

667
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,799
know area

668
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,679
conference to strive i mean there's a

669
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,000
attention here how to

670
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,720
get both done well it is i think it's

671
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,320
challenging

672
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,559
but i think one way we've tried this is

673
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,600
by co-location chess has been co-located

674
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,159
with crypto several times i agree i

675
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,600
agree actually we tried a couple of

676
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
times as well i think remember last time

677
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
was we did it was in

678
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
paris in france paris followed by

679
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
yeah i forgot which year yeah we tried a

680
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,360
couple of times that that certainly

681
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
helps as well

682
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
right although if they're you know on

683
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,880
two separate weeks then it's

684
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
it causes different tension because then

685
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
people want to travel for two weeks it's

686
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
hard to be away for two weeks sometimes

687
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,159
yes yeah i agree i think maybe uh modi

688
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,880
have some uh you know ideas where we can

689
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,120
you know start from start

690
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
because yes

691
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
yes uh

692
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,120
i i think

693
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
i think the fragmentation

694
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
of the

695
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,919
community is natural because the areas

696
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,360
are fragmented

697
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,159
but if we didn't start the special area

698
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,880
conferences pkc fsc

699
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,640
tcc and so on

700
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
these conferences

701
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,679
would have gone

702
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,799
to be hosted under under other

703
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
organizations

704
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
like tcc

705
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,640
could might as well be

706
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
hosted on the

707
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,400
special interest group of theory seaguct

708
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,159
in

709
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,679
acm

710
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,480
chess would have gone to ieee

711
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,840
signal processing

712
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,120
society and things like this so this is

713
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,360
one thing is to keep the umbrella

714
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,440
now

715
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,880
to put everything in one conference with

716
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,320
one committee that has to decide on all

717
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
these

718
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
papers

719
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
then

720
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
it's a little bit

721
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,600
disadvantage for

722
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,399
because

723
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
one of the one of the reasons for the

724
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
special conferences

725
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,360
is to let new authors publish a paper on

726
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
very specific problem

727
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,080
either suggesting one or or advancing

728
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,840
some

729
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,840
other and this paper let's say

730
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
in pkc it may be accepted to pkc but it

731
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,520
may not be accepted to

732
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,279
to crypto when it has to be in

733
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,720
competition with many many other

734
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,200
papers much more

735
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
let's say deeper on the on the subject

736
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,760
of public cryptography so that's one

737
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,799
role of the workshops or

738
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,679
the special area conferences is to allow

739
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,559
new authors to publish like first papers

740
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,640
until they really learn

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
how to do more comprehensive research

742
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,360
and write more comprehensive papers

743
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,039
the the the the another another reason

744
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
for the

745
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,440
for keeping the for keeping the

746
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,840
conferences separate

747
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
is to allow local hosts to host

748
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,120
conferences

749
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,440
showcasing to their deans

750
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
and

751
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,880
university presidents and so on that

752
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,159
they are

753
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
hosting the broader community they are

754
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,559
on the map

755
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,480
so next year for example

756
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
we may we may be going to atlanta

757
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,919
atlanta just started the school on cyber

758
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,600
security

759
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,679
and cryptography is part of it and this

760
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,880
is a way

761
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
for them to showcase

762
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
that they are an accepted school in the

763
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,399
community

764
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,240
and that's how

765
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,039
they

766
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,320
were offering to host so they are

767
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
they are i i'm i'm not saying there

768
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
aren't advantages of having a single

769
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,559
conference with

770
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,120
50 parallel sessions

771
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
on different subjects but there are also

772
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,360
advantages for the

773
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,960
separate conferences and if you ask me

774
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
i don't know

775
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,320
it's very hard to

776
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
to judge among the different criteria

777
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,279
it's a multi multi-criteria

778
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,039
uh

779
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,919
uh

780
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,440
decisions you know

781
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
if i like if i like to travel less i

782
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,679
would say you know put it all together

783
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,679
and it will solve my problem but then

784
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
somebody would say oh i want to host it

785
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,960
because we have a new

786
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
faculty and we want to show

787
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,159
to our

788
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,240
department that we are very active and

789
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,440
recognized so how do you reconcile these

790
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,799
different

791
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,520
willingness and different goals of

792
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,279
different people it's very hard to

793
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,880
decide i don't i don't know how to

794
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,840
decide

795
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
thank you

796
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,000
thank you

797
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,360
so do you have any other questions or

798
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,840
comments

799
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,360
i i was uh

800
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
thanks julia it's nice to see you again

801
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,559
um

802
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,520
yeah i was interested in the question of

803
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,720
geographic representation and

804
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,799
accessibility because because i live in

805
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,559
new zealand and it's often been

806
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,120
difficult to go to conferences

807
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
and so i quite like

808
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,679
the online conferences because

809
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,279
i can

810
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,720
zoom in and i don't need to get on a

811
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
plane

812
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
um

813
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,360
of course it depends on the on the time

814
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
zone but i was interested in your your

815
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,399
remark about the areas of the globe

816
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,519
where the conference has not taken place

817
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,559
uh

818
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,080
we i mean we've done an experiment in

819
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
the last three years that has made it

820
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,840
much more accessible to to come to

821
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
conferences and

822
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
clearly the number of registrations goes

823
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,559
up enormously maybe three times more

824
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,080
people are registering for the for all

825
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,480
the conferences because it's online

826
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
but it's very unclear

827
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,840
uh whether there's much actual

828
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
engagement in that and it's also very

829
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,080
unclear which which areas of the world

830
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
are represented so i mean right now on

831
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
the call by my calculation at least half

832
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
the people in the call uh are from japan

833
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,799
um

834
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,320
and we have

835
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
other other nearby countries are almost

836
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,240
not represented at all even though the

837
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,519
timing is

838
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,760
is quite correct so i guess i'm i guess

839
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,159
my comment is i'm questioning the need

840
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,720
to to have conferences in all places in

841
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
the world because even when it's very

842
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
accessible

843
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
it's not clear that people are

844
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
participating

845
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,159
let me let me just try to say something

846
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,440
that

847
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,399
given the given the coming meta verse

848
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,960
this question will be obsolete

849
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,880
because you'll be able to stay

850
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,679
in in your in in new zealand or

851
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,840
whatever in antarctica

852
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,360
and participate as part of the meta

853
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,320
in the locality of your wishes so this

854
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
is just a temporary situation sorry we

855
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
live in the universe once we move from

856
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,360
the universe to the metaverse

857
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
everything is solved

858
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,960
and i'm not doing i'm not doing

859
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,279
advertisement on behalf of any company

860
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,039
or any ceo

861
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,919
well for me though i i think uh virtual

862
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,399
experience is gonna not replace impulse

863
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
experience right you know if it's held

864
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in new zealand i would refuse to fly

865
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,320
over

866
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,440
um yeah but i think you have a good

867
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,919
question though i think maybe eventually

868
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,240
the the the new format might be a

869
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
mixture of virtue and in person that's

870
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,679
my guess

871
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,640
because you

872
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
clearly you know the

873
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,399
participation has increased right

874
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,279
because of the availability of vulture

875
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,679
meeting and at the same time i do feel

876
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,039
like the people

877
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,760
at least to myself you know

878
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,200
you know i like to have some kind you

879
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,559
know personal connection with people so

880
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,720
having some in-person component might be

881
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,120
important to a lot of people as well i

882
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
don't know what the final format might

883
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,960
be like

884
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
but

885
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,799
regardless i think it makes sense to

886
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,080
have

887
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,399
the conference or either virtual mixed

888
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,760
in certain

889
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
regions which we haven't been to yet as

890
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,279
a way to encourage support to promote

891
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,320
research in that areas right

892
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
uh

893
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
you know as to how this is exactly them

894
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,919
there are a lot of

895
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,760
challenges as we know right now right

896
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,159
your particular issues and so forth but

897
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,159
also

898
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,080
you know some of the regions may need

899
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,279
some help

900
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,280
to get it started first before they can

901
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,119
host conferences

902
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,199
so there are a lot of challenges i i put

903
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,599
this question as as as a challenger for

904
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,440
the community right so it's not

905
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,040
something the student committee can

906
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,159
solve it's it's us as communities

907
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
i feel like they had

908
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,679
some responsibility to think about this

909
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,879
thank you

910
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,520
so

911
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,359
do there any questions

912
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,839
