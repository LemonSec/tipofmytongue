00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
hello my name is hiroshionki the title

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
of my talk is radical exogenous on

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,759
mongolian cubs

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,200
this is a joint work with tomoki maria

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,799
first i give an overview of our work

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
a sergeant-based cryptography is one of

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
the candidates for post-quantum

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
cryptography

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
an advantage of isogen-based

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
cryptography is a small keys and

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
ciphertext

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
on the other hand the computation of

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
estrogen-based grip protocols

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
is relatively slow because of exogenous

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
computation

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,680
so speeding up as surging computation is

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,200
important

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
radical esogenies are one of the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
techniques speeding up exogenous

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
computation

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
these are formulas computing repeating

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,520
exogeny of the same degree

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
were proposed by catholic degree and

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
bear cotton at asia crypt 2020.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
they constructed radical exogenous on

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,119
10th normal forms

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
which are forms of herbitic curves

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
in this work

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
we constructed radical exogenous of

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,680
degree 3 and 4 on monomial curves

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
our formulas reduce

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
the cost of transformations between

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,079
curves in some protocols

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,119
in addition we prove a conjecture left

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,920
by open by cdv 2020

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
i introduced some mathematics for my

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,119
talk

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
analytic curve is a smooth algebraic

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,799
curve of genus 1.

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
an elliptic curve has an abelian group

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,399
structure

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,079
i mean that

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,960
we can define an addition on points on

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
analytic curve

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,159
there are many forms of every curves

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
in isogenic base cryptography we often

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,000
use

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,959
a monomial curves which are defined by

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,200
this equation

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
the reason why

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,640
we use monomial curves is that

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
these cows have efficient formulas for

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,800
scalar multiplications and exogenesis

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
and misogyny is a nonzero rational

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
homomorphism between earthquake curves

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
red y b

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
and nitrogen from e to e prime

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
then we can define the degree of five

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
and denote it by dig phi

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
and there is a nice oceany with the

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,160
inverse direction called the dual

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,519
exogenous

63
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
the disogne of phi

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
is denoted by a phi hat

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
phi hat is a map from a prime to e

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
and the degree of a hat is the same as

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
that of phi

68
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
here is an example of a nitrogen of

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,679
degree two

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,599
a red e b an lp curve over a field k

71
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
and an unknown integer complying to the

72
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
characteristic of an k

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
then there is a one-to-one

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,920
correspondence between the set of

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,400
subgroups of e of order n

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
and the set of exogeny of degree n from

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,400
e in this correspondence

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
a sablu subgroup g

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,680
corresponds to an estrogen with carnal g

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
we denote this exogeny by 5g

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,120
and its codomain by e over g

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
in this work we only consider the case

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
that g is cyclic

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
which is the case appearing in a

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,399
socially based cryptography

86
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,358
in other words we consider a subgroup

87
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:25,280
generated by a point p on analytic curve

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
given an energy curve e

89
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
and points p and q on e

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,040
the isogeny 5p

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
is

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,440
computable efficiently

93
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,479
the meaning of computing phi p

94
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,919
is computing the image of q

95
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
and phi p

96
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
and its codomain e over p

97
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
on the other hand given

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
e and e over p

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
computing p is considered to be had even

100
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
by a quantum computer

101
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
a certain base cryptography is based on

102
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,840
this assumption

103
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
i introduced two exogeny-based group

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
protocols

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
seaside and shiself

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
seaside is a different type key exchange

107
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
protocol which was proposed by a

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
catholic rank matinder pani and reynolds

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,639
at asia crypto 2018

110
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
i don't explain

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
detail of seaside

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
the important things for my talk uh that

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
season uses

114
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,919
uh lp curves

115
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,280
and i surgent defined over a prime field

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
fb

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
and where

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,919
p is a prime congruent to three mode

119
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
eight

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
and seaside uses only exogenous of all

121
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,160
the degrees

122
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,680
shisoff

123
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,160
is a variant of seaside which was

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,440
proposed by a catholic and the crew at

125
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
big crypto 2020

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
shisaf uses

127
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
a prime congruent to 7 mod 8

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,240
and also uses a social of degree 2 and

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
4.

130
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
now i introduce radical exogenous

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,360
red eb and lt curve over a field k

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
and an integer comparing to the

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
characteristic of k

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,199
and

135
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,240
p a point on e of order n

136
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
a radical associate is a formula of a

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
map

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
between

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,840
herbs curves and

140
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,160
a point on it of order n

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,039
a pair uh e and b corresponds to

142
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,400
e over p

143
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
and p prime

144
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
p prime

145
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,240
satisfying the group generated by uh

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,840
phi hat of p prime is equal to the group

147
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,880
generated by p

148
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
i'll explain the meaning of

149
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,800
this condition in the next slide

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
the theory of radical exogenous says

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
that

152
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
one can choose a form of

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,880
e over p and p prime are defined over

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
k of

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,319
an ends root of row

156
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
where row is the tenth pairing

157
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,720
of p and negative b

158
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
if you don't know what the plate pairing

159
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,120
is it's not problem the important thing

160
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
here is that the value row

161
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,000
can be efficiently computed by e and a p

162
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
and this is an image of a radical

163
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,599
exogenous

164
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,720
given

165
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
e

166
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,879
and

167
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,680
p

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
a radical exogenous computes

169
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,919
e over p

170
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
and p prime

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,879
the condition on p prime in the previous

172
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,560
slide says that

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
the exogenous waste kernel generated by

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
p is not

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
the derivation

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
of the isogeny with kernel generated by

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
p

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
in other words the isogeny with corners

179
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,200
generated by p prime

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
has a forward direction

181
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
and there are

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
an exogenous with such directions

183
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,839
the number n is corresponding to the

184
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,519
number of choices of an nth root of row

185
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,880
cdb 2020 uses forms of every curves such

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,920
that

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
p and p prime

188
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
are

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
0 0

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,680
and here are such forms

191
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
in the case

192
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,440
and equal 3

193
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000
the curve is

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
defined by this equation

195
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
and

196
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
in the case n is greater than 3

197
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
they use state normal form the curve

198
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
defined by this form where

199
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
the questions

200
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,160
b

201
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
and c satisfy

202
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
a relation depending on n

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
and there are examples of radical

204
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
exogenous

205
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,279
for

206
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
for n equal three the questions of the

207
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
domain are represented as

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
this and this

209
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,160
where alpha is a cube root of negative

210
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
s3

211
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
this is the case

212
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
that n equal four

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
here

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
alpha alpha is

215
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,839
a fourth root of negative b

216
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
this is a competing flaw in radical

217
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
exogenous of degree three

218
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
first given an lp curve we compute a

219
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
point of order three and the questions

220
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
a1 and s3 from the point

221
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,800
next we compute the questions

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,399
f a one prime and s three prime of the

223
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,880
codomain e prime

224
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
of the isogenic waste kernel generated

225
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,959
by zero zero on e

226
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,480
by the radical exogenous formula

227
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
the questions of the codomain

228
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
of the isogeny with kernel generated by

229
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,360
0 0 on

230
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
e prime

231
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
can be computed

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
in the same way

233
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,439
and so on

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
an advantage of this computing method is

235
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
that

236
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,440
we only need to generate

237
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
a point of order n

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
of the first exogeny

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,360
there is no computation for the kernels

240
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,640
of intermediate exogenous

241
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
this accelerates exogenous

242
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
of small degrees

243
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,639
in seaside and shisaf

244
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
especially shisaf because

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
shisaf

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
uses the degree

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
4.

248
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,880
then

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,399
how to

250
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,600
choose a radical alpha in shisei and

251
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
shisof

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
this answer is that we should choose

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,519
alpha in a prime field fp

254
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
in these protocols

255
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
there is the unique answer root in fp

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,760
if

257
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
n is compliant to p minus

258
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
1

259
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
and if n is

260
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,560
odd degree used in suicide and shift it

261
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
is the case

262
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
so

263
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
in this case

264
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
we can determine

265
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,839
the choice of alpha

266
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,800
to apply radical exogenous to shisoff

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,680
and we need to transform

268
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
our curve computed by radical exogenous

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
to a monomer cap

270
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,519
for

271
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,880
generating the first corner and

272
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,160
computing higher degree exogenous

273
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
these computation

274
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
are more efficient on montgomery curves

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
in the case n equal to

276
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,839
4

277
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,959
there are

278
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,360
two false rules in

279
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
prime field fp so

280
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,000
we need to determine which one

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
corresponds to a nesogyny used in

282
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
shiself

283
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,440
the choice is conjectured

284
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,800
by cdb 2020 but not proven

285
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,240
in this work we constructed radical

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,079
exogenous of degrees 3 and 4 on monomial

287
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
curves

288
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
and this reduces the cost of

289
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
transformations

290
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,720
in addition we proved the conjecture on

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
and record 4

292
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
before i explain our work we recall

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
monomer curves

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,639
a mongolia curve is analytic curve

295
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
defined by this equation

296
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
we call the question

297
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
a

298
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,959
and the monomer question of this curve

299
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
here are some important properties of

300
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,240
monomial curves

301
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
the order of

302
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,600
the point zero zero is two

303
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
a point whose x coordinate is one or

304
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
negative one

305
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,399
is a half of

306
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,760
uh zero

307
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
zero zero

308
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
we denote uh

309
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,600
the four cyclic group generated by a

310
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
point

311
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
of x coordinate 1

312
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
by

313
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,399
c e 4

314
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,519
right

315
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,480
t

316
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
be the x coordinate of a point of order

317
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
3

318
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
then the monomial question is given by

319
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
this

320
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
so a monomer curve is determined by the

321
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
x-coordinate of a point of order three

322
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
on it

323
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,600
now i introduce our contributions

324
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
the first is a radical exogenous formula

325
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
of degree three

326
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,600
a pair of a monomer curve and the point

327
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
of order three on it is represented

328
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,880
by

329
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,790
the x coordinate of

330
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,480
[Music]

331
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,320
the point of order three t

332
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,279
so

333
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,800
there is a radical

334
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:39,880
a isog

335
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
indeed

336
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
we proved this serum

337
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,639
let

338
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,000
e

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
a t be a pair of among omega

340
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,279
and a point of order three on it

341
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,839
and phi

342
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,360
be a misogyny with kernel generated by a

343
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,880
point of x coordinate t

344
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
all right

345
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,720
d prime be the x coordinate of a point

346
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
of order three

347
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,839
on

348
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,040
the codomain of phi

349
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,199
that satisfies

350
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
this condition

351
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
remember that this condition comes from

352
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
the direction of the exogenous waste

353
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
color generated by a point of x

354
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
coordinate d prime

355
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,279
then t prime is computed by this

356
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,040
the fair alpha is the cube root of this

357
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,199
the next is a formula for a degree 4

358
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
the monomer question naturally

359
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
determines a

360
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,759
4 cyclic subgroup

361
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
on the montgomery cup

362
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,279
so there is a radical exogeny between

363
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
mongomery questions

364
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,480
red

365
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
e be among america with question a

366
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,679
and a phi b a nisogyny of a colonel and

367
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,119
ce4

368
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
as that satisfies

369
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
this condition

370
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,480
and red

371
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,919
a prime

372
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
is monumental question

373
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,039
of the codomain of phi

374
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
and define

375
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
small l and small f prime

376
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
as

377
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
this and this

378
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
then

379
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
small a prime

380
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
is computed by

381
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
this

382
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,320
where alpha is a fourth root of small a

383
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,799
and here is a comparison between the

384
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,960
original radical asymptotes and others

385
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
in the original

386
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
first we transform among america

387
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,679
am to attach normal form et

388
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,799
next

389
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,000
we compute radical exogenous repeatedly

390
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
finally we transform again the resulting

391
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,000
curve e t n to among my curve

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
e m m

393
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
and this work and there is no

394
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,520
transformation but we need some

395
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
computation for barriers used in radical

396
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
isogenes

397
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,200
these costs

398
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
uh

399
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
is much smaller than the transformations

400
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
in the original

401
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
this is the cost of the original and our

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,360
radical exogenesis

403
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,120
here

404
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
e stands for exponentiation

405
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
and multiplication and addition and i

406
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,880
inversion

407
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,080
in csf a radical is computed by an

408
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,880
exponentiation

409
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,320
whose exponent is about p

410
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
so the cost of e

411
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
is approximately

412
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,600
a 1.5 log pm

413
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,160
in degree 3

414
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,760
cdb 2020 needs

415
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,320
exponentiations

416
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,559
for transformations

417
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,520
only

418
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,559
other hand our formula doesn't need

419
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,039
exponentiation for recovering the

420
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,440
question

421
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
in degree 4

422
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,640
cdb 2020

423
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
doesn't need exponentiation but

424
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
inversion for transformations

425
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
our formula

426
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,080
doesn't need either for recovering the

427
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,080
question

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
next

429
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
i explain our second contribution which

430
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
is about a choice of a false root in

431
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
shiself

432
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
we proved

433
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,039
that in the radical exogeny of degree 4

434
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
or monomer curve

435
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
we can compute the associate used in

436
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
shishaf by taking

437
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
a radical alpha

438
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,360
as

439
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
this

440
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,440
by using an isolation uh sorry by using

441
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
an isomorphous between a monomial cup

442
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
and a test normal phone

443
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,919
we can prove the conjecture

444
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
on radical exogenous of degree 4 from

445
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,679
this serum

446
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,559
indeed we proved this in a radical

447
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,080
estrogen of degree 4 on 10 normal forms

448
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
we can compute the exogenous used in csf

449
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,919
by taking a radical alpha as this

450
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,880
this is

451
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
a conjecture

452
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,200
by cdb 2020

453
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,799
finally i conclude my talk

454
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
we constructed radical exogeny of degree

455
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
3 and 4 among americans

456
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,159
our formulas slightly improve the

457
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
efficiency of systems using

458
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,480
radicalizations

459
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,840
and we

460
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,440
proved the conjecture on degree 4

461
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,799
wrapped as open by cdb 2020

462
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,080
one of the future work is searching

463
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
other applications of radical exogenous

464
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
for example runner works in a thousand

465
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,120
grouse could be a candidate

466
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,479
that's all thank you for watching
