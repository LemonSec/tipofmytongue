00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,679
hello everyone my name is pierre dartra

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm a student of luca defeo today i will

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,040
present our work on the security of

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,360
oside financed by ibm research

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,000
oside is an isogeny-based protocol

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,720
introduced by leonardo colo and david

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
kohl in 2019 to generalize seaside but

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
unlike seaside oside is more structured

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
and we explored its structure to provide

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,040
an attack improving an id by onuki

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
osad uses a lot of mathematics due to

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
colo and cohen that i will need to

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
introduce first

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
as seaside osad is based on a

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,239
cryptographic group action so i will

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
explain what it is

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,680
then we will see how this cryptographic

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
group action is built in oside in order

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,600
to explain how the protocol works

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
finally i represent you our attack

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,480
and possible counter measures

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,879
now let's introduce cryptographic group

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,240
actions

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
the original idea was first introduced

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
by brassard and jung in 1991 and reused

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
by coven in his paper constructing the

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
first isogenic base cryptosystem

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
and surprisingly to have a cryptographic

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
group action we need a group and a space

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,759
to act upon

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
the group has to be obedient and the

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
action needs to be transitive meaning

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
that we have a simple orbit in this

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
space all space elements can be reached

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
from any element of the space with the

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
group action

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
it needs to be faithful also only the

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
trivial element acts trivially

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
the group action needs to be easy to

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
compute for cryptographic needs

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,399
and finally

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,280
it needs to be one way to ensure

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
cryptographic security if we know x and

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
y in the space related by a secret group

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,038
element g then g is hard to find

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,959
we can do a lot of cryptography with

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,760
cryptographic group actions including

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
one of the simplest primitives key

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
exchange

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,239
actually oside is a difficult man key

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
exchange to set up such a key exchange

52
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
with the cryptographic group action we

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
fix a public space element x0

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
alice and bob can choose separately

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,840
secret group element

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,519
gnh they will act separately on x0 with

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,720
their secrets and exchange the computed

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
data gx0 and hx0

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
then alice and bob will be able to

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
recover the shared secret key ghx0

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
by acting with their secret on the data

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
they receive from one another

63
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,720
they will find the same secret key

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
because the group is a billion and the

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,599
protocol will be secure because the

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
group action is one way

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
now let's see how the group action works

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
first we need a group that will be the

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
ideal class group of an order in a

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
quadratic imaginary field so i will

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
briefly recall what it is a quadratic

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
imaginary field is a field extinction of

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,440
degree 2 of a q that is not real

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
an order is a summary and a full rank

75
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,640
lattice in this field

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
if we fix an order o we can look at all

77
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,879
ideals which are simply lattices stable

78
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
by multiplication by o

79
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
there is a commutative multiplication

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
law of ideals with the order as neutral

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,760
element

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
the set of invertible ideals for this

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
law form a group and we have a subgroup

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,799
formed by principal ideals which are

85
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
basically ideals generated by your

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
scholar

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
the caution of those groups is the ideal

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
class group it is finite so it is

89
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
suitable for cryptography

90
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
now that we know how a group

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
what will be the space of the action

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
the space will be a set of elliptic

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
curves and a group action will use a

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
correspondence between group elements

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,440
meaning ideal classes and isogenes

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
between those elliptic curves

97
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,440
so i will briefly recall those notions

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
of course you know elliptic curves over

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
finite fields they are simply given by

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
this polynomial equation on the plane

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
and a point at infinity elliptic curves

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
have a group structure given by the

103
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,840
addition law described on the figure

104
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
displayed here this is why elliptic

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
curves are used in discrete logarithm

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
based cryptography

107
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
but here we do post-quantum cryptography

108
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
so we use isogenes which are morphemes

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
between elliptic curves

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
as morphisms between algebraic varieties

111
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
given by rational fractions and also

112
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
group homomorphisms

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
i give here two simple examples

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
the multiplication map which is an

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
endomorphism meaning an isogeny of an

116
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,560
elliptic curve to itself and other

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,320
finite fields the frobenius given by the

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,080
exponentiation of the characteristic

119
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
endomorphisms our special class of

120
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,120
isogenes mapping an elliptic curve to

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
itself and a form for given elliptic

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
covering

123
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
this ring is either of our finite field

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,479
an order in a quadratic imaginary field

125
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
this is the ordinary case

126
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
or a maximal order in a quaternion

127
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,400
algebra this is the super singular case

128
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
if you are not familiar with quaternions

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
you just have to keep in mind that those

130
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
are non-commutative four-dimensional

131
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
extensions of a queue

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,000
orders have the same definition that we

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
introduced before and maximal orders are

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,199
simply maximal for the inclusion

135
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
in isogenic base cryptography we often

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
use supercingular elliptic curves for

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,840
security and efficiency reasons

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
that i recall those basics we can get to

139
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
a side

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
if we have a super angular elliptic

141
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
curve and a quadratic imaginary field

142
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
we defined a k orientation as an

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
embedding of k in the quaternion algebra

144
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,520
made of linear combinations of

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,319
endomorphisms with rational coefficients

146
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
if o is an order of k we have a

147
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,599
primitive or orientation if o is the

148
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
maximal order in k mapping to the

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
endomorphism ring

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
put in other verbs it maps to the

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
intersection of the image of k

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
with the endomorphism ring

153
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
actually the space of oxide group action

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
by the ideal class group of an older o

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
will be the space of o oriented super

156
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
singular elliptic curves

157
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
now as promised i explain how hydrogen

158
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
is appear in this group action

159
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,520
if we have two k oriented elliptic

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,199
curves e and f

161
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
a k oriented isogeny between those

162
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
curves is simply an isogeny respecting

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,479
the orientation meaning following the

164
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
formula displayed here

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,160
the degree appearing in this formula is

166
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
roughly the cardinality of the kernel

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
we say that the isogeny is ascending

168
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,199
if the order orienting e

169
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
is smaller than the order orienting f

170
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,840
that it is horizontal if both orders are

171
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,599
equal and that it is descending if the

172
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
order orienting e is bigger than the

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,759
order orienting f

174
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
we are not always in those cases

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,440
except when isogeny has a prime degree

176
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,400
now

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,680
we fix a quadratic imaginary field k and

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
a prime l and we look at the graph whose

179
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,879
vertices are k oriented elliptic curves

180
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
and edges

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
isogenys of degree l

182
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
the graph is very interesting because

183
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
every connected component has a volcano

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
structure

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,000
on this connected component for instance

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
we have the crater of the volcano which

187
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,799
is oriented by the maximal order of the

188
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
field

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
at the crater we have one horizontal

190
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
isogeny and one dissenting isogen

191
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,519
below we always have

192
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,640
one ascending isogeny and l-descending

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
isogeny at each vertex and the

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
orientation by the order of index l in

195
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
the order above

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
hence the index

197
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
is given by the degree when we descend

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
the graph

199
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
for our side group action every level of

200
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
the graph can be a potential space

201
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
but as we go down we see that the size

202
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,680
of the level grows exponentially

203
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
so we need to choose a level deep enough

204
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,320
to make sure

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
that the cryptosystem is secure

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,240
once we have chosen a level and the

207
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
corresponding order o the ideal class

208
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
group of o will act on this level as

209
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,880
follows

210
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,440
to every o ideal we associate a

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,839
horizontal isogeny

212
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,959
and take the codomain as the result of

213
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,959
the action of this ideal on the domain

214
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
this correspondence

215
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,000
defines indeed a group action because

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
principal ideals correspond to

217
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
endomorphisms so that ideas in the same

218
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
class

219
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
act the same way

220
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
this is why we have an action of the

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
ideal class group

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
and finally multiplication of ideas

223
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
correspond to isogenic composition and

224
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,160
that's the reason why we have indeed a

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
group action property

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,120
as kolo kohel and anuki proved this

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
action is furthermore transitive and

228
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
faithful

229
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,680
but is this action easy to compute on

230
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
one way as required to have a

231
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,279
cryptographic group action

232
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
to make oside practical

233
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
we need to use isogenic graphs that we

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
just introduced

235
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,320
suppose that we use level n as a group

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
action space down here computing

237
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
directly the group action in this space

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
is almost impossible

239
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
instead if we want to compute the action

240
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
of an ideal q let's say on e n in this

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,279
space represent e n as a descending

242
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,959
isogenic chain

243
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,200
starting from the crater

244
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
and going down to e n

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
and we compute the action level by level

246
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
going down the chain which is practical

247
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
with modular equations

248
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
the results will be a descending

249
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,320
elisogenic chain again and the ending

250
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,680
element will be the action of q on e n

251
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,519
for efficiency reasons colo and kohl use

252
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
this technique only with a bunch of

253
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,480
prime ideals generating the ideal class

254
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,279
group

255
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,000
then they can compute the group action

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
by a product of this bunch of ideals

257
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
this is called restricted cryptographic

258
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,920
group action

259
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,639
the situation is the same in seaside we

260
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,720
have a restricted cryptographic group

261
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
action by an ideal class group

262
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
except

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,200
that the level used in seaside

264
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
in the isogenic graphs is way closer to

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
the crater only the first level is used

266
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
in oside we have to go much deeper this

267
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
is what makes oside much more vulnerable

268
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,600
to security attacks than csi

269
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
now at last we have what we need to

270
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
introduce the protocol

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
once we know the outside framework

272
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
there is a naive diffie-hellman key

273
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
exchange coming to mind

274
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
first we just fix a public

275
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,560
esogenic chain that is descending

276
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
we let alice and bob choose their secret

277
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,680
ideas as products of generator qj with

278
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
exponents within a range r

279
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,360
and we let them act on the public chain

280
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,240
with their secret ideal exchange the

281
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,200
resulting chain of the computation

282
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
and finally act on the exchange chain

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,800
with their respective secret ideals to

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
find a shared secret chain h

285
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
unfortunately this is not secure

286
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
kolo and kohel already knew it

287
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,079
why

288
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
because of the graph structure

289
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,639
let's say that we want to recover

290
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
alice's secret ideal class

291
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,839
if we know both chains e and f

292
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,800
it is easy to recover the secret ideal

293
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
class relating them recursively

294
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
first finding the ideal class at level 0

295
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
is trivial

296
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
and if we know the ideal class at level

297
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,800
i

298
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
we only have l possibilities for the

299
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
ideal class at level i plus 1

300
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
because of this equation

301
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
so we simply have to test them all until

302
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,439
we map e i plus 1 to f i plus 1.

303
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
so how can we make oside secure

304
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
first remember that the chains that

305
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,079
reveal all this information are not

306
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
essential to the protocol

307
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,959
they are just computational tools

308
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,360
but alice and bob cannot just remove

309
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
this information when they change data

310
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,959
so the trick introduced by colo and

311
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,720
correll is to provide horizontal instead

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
of vertical information

313
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,279
alice and bob will perform the same

314
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,399
protocol

315
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
but simply send to each other the action

316
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,880
of the qj in the neighborhood of the

317
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
ending element they found and not all

318
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,000
the chain

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
nonetheless is it sufficient to make

320
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
oside secure

321
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
the answer is no

322
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
actually

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,880
the additional horizontal chains can be

324
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
used to recover this descending chain

325
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,639
kept secret

326
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
in the key exchange

327
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
and as explained this makes oscillate

328
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
vulnerable to a key recovery

329
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,720
an idea introduced by onuki is to

330
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,519
leverage those chains to find a cycle in

331
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
the isogenic graph

332
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
or put in other words an endomorphism to

333
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
do that we have to find a principle

334
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
ideal that is easily expressed as a

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
product of the qj with short exponents

336
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,600
and then compute the action by such an

337
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,040
ideal

338
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
as we saw when we introduce the group

339
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
action a principle ideal corresponds to

340
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,199
an endomorphism or put in other words

341
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,839
a cycle in the orbit of the ideal class

342
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,079
group then once we have such an

343
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,519
endomorphism

344
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
we can actually recover the ascending

345
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,320
isogeny relating level n and n minus 1

346
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
in the chain

347
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,440
technically we compute the endomorphism

348
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,199
we found on the l-torsion to recover the

349
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,560
kernel of the ascending isogeny and once

350
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
we have the kernel we have the isogeny

351
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
so the attack works as follows

352
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
first we leverage the horizontal chains

353
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
to find the cycle

354
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,480
then we recover fn minus one with this

355
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,759
cycle

356
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
this way we can push the horizontal

357
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,560
chains to level n minus one

358
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,279
this is an easy computation

359
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
and find a cycle again

360
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,160
this is how we recover the whole chain

361
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
making those side vulnerable again to

362
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,800
the attack represented earlier

363
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
the difficult step in our attack

364
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
is to find a principle ideal of the

365
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
right form to be able to compute a cycle

366
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
easily

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
anuki struggled with this problem and

368
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
did not provide a practical way to do it

369
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
our main contribution is a solution to

370
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,120
this problem we noticed that all we have

371
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,079
to do

372
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,600
is to find

373
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
a short enough vector

374
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,160
in the relations lattice of the ideal

375
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,679
class group

376
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,799
because such a vector will define a

377
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
principal ideal

378
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
and if the exponents are short enough

379
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
we'll be able to perform the group

380
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
action

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,160
this way is actually more efficient at

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,039
one keys and breaks color and cohes

383
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,960
parameters

384
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
the complex step in our approach is to

385
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
find a short vector in the relation

386
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
lattice this is exponential but still

387
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
practical with colo and kohl's

388
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,919
parameters using bkz

389
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
all other steps are polynomial mainly

390
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,280
group actions including the discrete

391
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
logarithm computations needed to compute

392
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
the relation lattice because

393
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,000
the ideal class group is smooth

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
but in practice those polynomial

395
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,559
operations are very slow compared to the

396
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
lattice reduction because group actions

397
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
are very slow to compute

398
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
this is why

399
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
there is no known implementation of osi

400
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
to this day

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
nevertheless we implemented the protocol

402
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
and the attack with toy parameters

403
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,880
with those parameters we found that the

404
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,840
attack runs in reasonable time compared

405
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
to the protocol execution

406
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
as we explain

407
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
the bottom line is if we make the

408
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
protocol practical then the attack

409
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
becomes practical as well because the

410
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,960
bottleneck is not the exponential

411
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
lattice reduction

412
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,679
but

413
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,960
the polynomial time operations

414
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
can the attack be countered

415
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,240
yes

416
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
because our lattice reduction relies on

417
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
a strong hypothesis to work

418
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
we need to make sure that they are short

419
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
enough vectors in the relation lattice

420
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,559
to be able to compute a cycle

421
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
heuristically the first minimum of this

422
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,400
lattice for the infinity norm is given

423
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
by the displayed formula

424
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,360
so under the reasonable assumption that

425
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
the key space tightly covered the ideal

426
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
class group which is common

427
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
with a restricted cryptographic group

428
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
action we get that the first minimum is

429
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,600
short enough

430
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,240
because we have this formula

431
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,480
the question is do we have efficient

432
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
enough lattice reduction algorithms to

433
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
find short vectors

434
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
this leads to our first counter measure

435
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,720
make it hard to find short vector by

436
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,679
increasing the dimension of the lattice

437
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,520
the drawback is that it makes the

438
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,559
protocol excessively costly and

439
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,919
actually pointless because it now relies

440
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,320
on the lattice-based security assumption

441
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,919
that svp is hard but why should we use a

442
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,799
very inefficient key exchange relying on

443
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,120
svp if they are much more efficient

444
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,919
lattice-based alternatives with the same

445
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
or better security level

446
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
the second counter measure increases the

447
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
size of the ideal class group to make

448
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,159
sure that there are no short enough

449
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,280
vectors

450
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
in the relation lattice

451
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
because this bound is no longer

452
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
satisfied

453
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
however it makes oxide no longer a

454
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,240
cryptographic group action impeding

455
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
other cryptographic constructions beyond

456
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
key exchange that could be very

457
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
interesting

458
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
so to conclude our attack severely

459
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,918
undermines the relevance of oxide
