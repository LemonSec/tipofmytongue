1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,760
hello and good morning uh this is joint

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,440
work with kan nauwen and paulton

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,480
vernessi

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
i'm sticky

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,080
today we shall discuss how black box

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,280
reductions

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,879
naturally lift to set up assumptions

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
um we shall begin our talk

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
with an overview of fully black box

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
reductions

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
uh we're going to give a simple example

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,519
for concreteness

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
and then we're going to describe

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,800
beyond

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
the standard model

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,079
and introduce that is set up assumptions

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,560
and

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,000
[Music]

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,879
slowly one by one identify the issues

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
with

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
just trying to

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
make the reduction or work

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,239
then we're going to state our resulting

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
formula

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,719
we're going to

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,760
define

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
more

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
more detail what we mean by set of

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,920
assumptions

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,120
and

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,840
i identify the the basic characteristics

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
and necessary property

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
of one

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
and then we're going to finalize our

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
talk by digging in into

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
the

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
proof and seeking the intuition on earth

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
from this result

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
let us begin the talk

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
let's move to blackbox concentrations

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,040
let there be two primitives

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
uh p and q

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
uh we used to show that uh no adversary

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
of some kind let's say probabilistical

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,320
normal time can break p

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,040
and

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
normally we assume that the adversary

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
cannot break q

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,799
well

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
the

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
bread and butter of cryptographers

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
worldwide is a

53
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
defining deduction r

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
and aim for a proof by contradiction

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,799
um

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
namely if the adversary

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
can break um p

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
uh

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,680
the um

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,239
adversary uh the

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
there is an adversary

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,720
via a reduction r

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
um that can uh break the instantiation

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
of q

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,840
we say that the reduction is a black box

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
as it has no internal access to the

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
workings

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,200
of the adversary the primitive

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,599
what does that mean in practice though

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,440
let's work over a concrete example

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,120
um

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
pick a lamp runtime signatures

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
the general idea is that the signer

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,840
picks uh

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
um

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,280
uh pairs of randomness

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
uh and uh they they utilize one-way

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
functions to effectively commit to that

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
uh randomness without uh disclosing it

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
essentially

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
the public key let's say

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
then a signature

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
can be constructed by just

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
revealing

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
um

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
the corresponding first or second

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
element of its pair for its beat of the

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
message

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
and that's the full idea one time right

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
um

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
in practice we want efficiency so

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
next idea comes to mind is okay we have

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
proven there's a reduction and things

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
support in the standard model

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
how about we add random oracle

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
well um

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,120
we we need to prove our reduction still

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
works with presence of the random

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,518
article and we don't have a case

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
where

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
our whole scheme is broken

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,400
so our main question

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
is uh um

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
does the

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
adversary break

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,519
the

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
uh signatures

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
uh

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
at the signature scheme we have

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
um

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,238
well now at the adversary and our

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,238
instantiation of one-way functions say

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,918
we call def have access to the random

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
oracle

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
uh there are a few questions

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
usually reduction let's say

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
non-programmable

118
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
um uh case uh it provides

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
direct access to

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,919
to to the oracle so it does the back and

121
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,000
forth with the adversary

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
um but does not actually interact with

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
it

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,759
so

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
say we have that covered

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,199
how does it handle the adversary now

127
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
because

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
in the standard model we proved security

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
and we're discussing as we said like

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
probabilistical normal time adversaries

131
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
as an example well now

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,479
there are the addresses are all common

133
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,600
sense

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
um what do we sample over

135
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,840
uh

136
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
how how do we connect those

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
uh different uh

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
random variables that we have taken the

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,919
probability over

140
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
um

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
and

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
they are stood um

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
in the crowd uh

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
first probably thought okay well what if

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
the adversary is inefficient

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
and just wants to keep querying the

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
random article what happens well

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
we

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
random oracle has infinite state so we

150
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
have to account for that

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,560
and this also brings into question that

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,639
well we now need to ensure that

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
um

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
whatever reduction we have our new cons

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
the construction we're describing right

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,479
um

157
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
uh

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
can can do have issues with correctness

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
i will talk about all this

160
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
in summary

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
we need to reason about reductions that

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,160
now have access to a random oracle

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
under this new setup assumption

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
we need to establish correctness

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
we need to establish security

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
to do that we need to describe

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
how the reduction even handles the

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
random oracle or generally the setup

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
assumption we have established

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,039
we need to describe

171
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
how and over what we're going to sample

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,240
we now have oracle machines we need to

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
sample over

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
for instance the adversaries as we said

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
in adversary maybe perhaps unbounded

176
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,039
and as may decide to keep querying

177
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
the article between thinking beyond

178
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,840
we saw that a fully black box reduction

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
still lifts to that set assumption

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
recall there is a considerable work

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
as you can see on the slide

182
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
some of it

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,400
on black box reduction hierarchies

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,360
rheingold travis sun and vadan

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
described a

186
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
first fundamental abstract framework

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
on that later buyer bruce can fizzling

188
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,560
created a much finer hierarchy

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
that we will review later

190
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
hofkins and nowin

191
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
concrete framework at reasonable

192
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,240
reactions upon which we built

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
let us give some examples

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
well common setup assumptions

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
in use are of course

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
the random oracle model the ideal cipher

197
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
module

198
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
common reference string or random string

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
you can have more exotic examples

200
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,960
such as the random beaker

201
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,639
going back to the landford example

202
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,039
um let us add the random moroccan for f

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
more efficient randomness

204
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
um

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,759
there are now we have to consider

206
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,840
reduction right from what we have proven

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
from the standard model and the question

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,039
is

209
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
what exactly happens

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
uh there are a few questions um

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
at the end of the day

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
uh we need to show that uh that little

213
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,919
devil adversary does not break our

214
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,720
lampard signature scheme

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
um

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
adding another moral means our one-way

217
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,360
function needs to query the article

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
the action

219
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
we seek needs to handle our queries for

220
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,759
the adversary

221
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
note we consider

222
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
non-programmable reactions that means

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
the reduction does not interfere with

224
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
the oracle

225
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,679
we leave open programmable reductions

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
that is we aim for a full black box

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
non-programmable reduction

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
we need to show that our scheme still is

229
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
correct

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
a secure scheme that does nothing is

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,839
kind of

232
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,040
useless um

233
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,000
uh

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
does uh giving access to the oracle

235
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
interfere with uh correctness

236
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
uh how do we define correctness uh in

237
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
past models so that could be simply said

238
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,839
membership

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,000
we do a more concrete treatment in our

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
work

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,399
finally

242
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
we do not sample over the same adversary

243
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
from the standard one

244
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
uh recall this is an adversary that has

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
access to an organ it's an oracle

246
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,399
machine

247
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,839
we do have to consider its

248
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,440
circumstantiation

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
and it's adversary

250
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
the probability sample is different

251
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
and recall the adversary can be

252
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
unbounded i could just attempt to read

253
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,079
the whole oracle state

254
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
we tackled all these problems in

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
particular we saw that the standard

256
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,560
model

257
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,839
has a lifting correspondence to any

258
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,680
well-defined set of assumptions

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,560
uh in detail for any parameters p and q

260
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,399
and some set of assumption m

261
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,800
which satisfies uh

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
certain properties

263
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,560
any fully black box non-programmable

264
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,839
reduction

265
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,440
uh from p2q naturally lifts to this

266
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
assumption m

267
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
note that we build on top of

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
half heinz and i win and not uh the

269
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
framework of rangol travis and vadan

270
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,599
which is more abstract

271
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,880
that leaves the question where we stand

272
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,399
in the

273
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
fine hierarchy of bachelor brewski and

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
fiscally

275
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
as we said

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,320
we consider fully black box reductions

277
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
that means um

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,880
in

279
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
in their hierarchy

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
the bbp kind i will leave open the

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,399
question

282
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,360
of

283
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
the existence for of lifting

284
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
correspondences

285
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
in the other kinds

286
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
how do we define a setup assumption

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
we need a generic definition that

288
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,800
encompasses all established models

289
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
we could consider set assumption as a

290
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,120
construct that samples over all possible

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
functions say over a domain x and equal

292
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
domain y

293
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
we sample with some distribution

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
and we'll generally cover

295
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
most

296
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,519
oracles

297
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
however

298
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
we do have to consider unbound

299
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
adversaries that could query

300
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
the whole oracle state and let us

301
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
consider a random argument

302
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
that means

303
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
an infinite state that is x could be

304
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,479
infinite

305
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
to handle that um

306
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
we

307
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,360
we break down x um into essays of sets

308
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
and we progressively sample from there

309
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,399
to keep it simple let us consider single

310
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
parameter l

311
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
so we define a filtration

312
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
x l

313
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,680
over x that is we create a sequences of

314
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,040
sets

315
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
that progressively cover

316
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
eggs

317
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,680
and we prove that

318
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
if the sampling is what we call

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,040
consistent

320
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
practically that is quitting for more

321
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
state

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
does not

323
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
alter the perceived prior distribution

324
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,440
um a tuning machine could have uh quit

325
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
it that is let's say you

326
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
query n bits of information and you

327
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
create plus one

328
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,519
that is

329
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
uh and you try to forget the extra

330
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
you're not going to see a difference

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,720
we saw if that is the case

332
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
we can converge to the desired

333
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
distribution

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
note that when we say infinite minimum

335
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
cannibal

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
that is x is still a discrete set we did

337
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
not go into the real numbers

338
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,519
that is out of our scope

339
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
the parametric sampling um that we

340
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
described uh extends uh further um and

341
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,760
forms the cracks of our proof

342
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,639
now what is the intuition we unearth

343
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
with our proof

344
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
we already established that we are

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
working with a measurable space over a

346
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
cannibal set which

347
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,279
makes things more interesting

348
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
and essentially forces us to prove

349
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
convergence for all our distributions

350
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,920
and as we said we do that through

351
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
parameterizing access

352
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
um at the end of the day though we want

353
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
to show that let's say the ceremonies on

354
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
the left side

355
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
and the stars on the right side we have

356
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
a primitive p and some instantiation of

357
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,760
f

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
of another primitive

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
and

360
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
an adversary an unbounded say in the

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,959
standard model

362
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,480
uh breaks p

363
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,440
then

364
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
it will break f

365
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
now that fact

366
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
s we we claim and so is enough to show

367
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
that

368
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
any

369
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,959
adversary

370
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,600
different demonstrate with oracle access

371
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
um

372
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
in in the setup assumption

373
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,199
is it that is able to break p now is

374
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
able to break

375
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
f that has access to all

376
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
that is our security proof now symbols

377
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,519
over

378
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
oracle instantiations

379
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
we do sample over all adversaries that

380
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
have access to the oracle o

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,880
thus we prove that the reduction in the

382
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,519
standard model can be used

383
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,240
to bound the advantage of

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
adversaries

385
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
with

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
access to a particular oracle

387
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,600
instantiation

388
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
recall from the previous

389
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
assumption slide that we need to

390
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,440
parametrically allow access

391
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
progressively to the state of the oracle

392
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
in the proof we essentially define

393
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
sequences of instantiation of f and also

394
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
sequences of instantiations of

395
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,800
the adversary now we need to model um

396
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,320
something over oracle instantiations

397
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
we'll just first order all oracle

398
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
instantiations and for that we're going

399
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,639
to use the security parameter lambda

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,720
so for each five second parameter lambda

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
uh we're going to create a row

402
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
and for each particular oracle

403
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,399
instantiation as we increase the

404
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
parameter of lambda uh we get a path if

405
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
united state p breaks an association of

406
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,680
a primitive p

407
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,560
then that means that for some path after

408
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,639
some security parameter value

409
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,320
uh the probability of our construction

410
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
being equal to one is uh non-negligible

411
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,079
to the security parameter lambda

412
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
thus we divide our proof into two

413
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,040
segments

414
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,079
first

415
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,320
we saw that a full black box reduction

416
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
in the standard model

417
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
uh implies the existence of

418
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
a correspondence a reflective one

419
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,519
um

420
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,160
of expectation between each row

421
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
of these paths we have described

422
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
that means again that

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,040
if the expectation is non-negligible

424
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
on the left

425
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
then it is non-negligible it's a

426
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,680
negligible functional rate

427
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
um the second step now

428
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,839
that we saw is

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,880
that we can use this expectation over

430
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
um all of the the paths uh that define

431
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,959
oracle instantiations

432
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
uh to bound the advantage of the

433
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,040
adversary

434
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
in the setup assumption

435
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
and thus

436
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
we we have started with a reduction in

437
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
standard model and we have proven that

438
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
there exists a

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,360
reduction

440
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
in

441
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,440
the

442
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
setup assumption

443
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
to sum up

444
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,919
we showed that

445
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
any non-programmable fully black box

446
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,119
reduction in the standard model

447
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,919
lifts to set up assumptions

448
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,679
that are well defined

449
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
even if the adversaries are inefficient

450
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,959
we'll have to open the question

451
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
about the

452
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
the rest of the hierarchy of bucket

453
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
bruce can fizzling

454
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
in particular

455
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
if we can extend this lifting

456
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,679
correspondence

457
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,679
to different kinds of reductions

458
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
feel free to shoot us an email with any

459
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
questions

460
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,160
we're always happy to discuss and chat

461
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,360
thank you very much have a nice day
