1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,879
hello my name is max russell and this

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
video is the presentation for the pkc

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,560
2022 paper

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,759
um

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,280
that is joined to work with vladimir

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,879
bashevsky and cain guyan

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,920
so first just a slide of notation you

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
can pause the video if you want to read

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
um okay so as a summary uh the blank

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,439
signature scheme is built upon three

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,880
major components

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
the first one being an encryption scheme

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
that tolerates some computations on the

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
cipher text i'll come back to that

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
in later in the presentation listen the

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,800
second one is a one-time signature

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
scheme

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,840
which is uh

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
originates actually from a uh 2018

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
construction upon which we improve

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
and the last one is a set membership

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
proof

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,199
uh which we just take as a black box

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:53,920
so

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
in the end uh the scheme is round

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,480
optimal those just two communications

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
between the user and the server and the

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
signature in the end is about 150

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
kilobytes

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
okay so the first part of this talk is

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,439
the lattice based one-time signature

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,040
construction which i just mentioned um

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,920
okay

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,119
so

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
the 2018 construction uh goes as follows

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
so you sample a uniformly random matrix

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,840
a

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
and uh the secret key is going to be uh

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
uniformly

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
uniformly random uh short vector s and y

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,479
by uniformly random in short i mean that

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,320
every coefficient is drawn

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,600
uh

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
uniformly between minus b and b where b

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
is some a small bound

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,399
and then

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
the public key is

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,360
v and w which is a s and a y

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
now if you want to

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,079
sign some message mu so mu is a

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
polynomial with binary coefficients

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,399
then you're going to compute the

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
signature z which is mu s plus y and now

54
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
if you want to verify the signature

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
you're going to check that a z is indeed

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
equal to mu v plus w

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
and second you're going to check that z

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,919
is indeed small why is this small it's

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
because s and y are smaller than b

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
infinity norm and the multiplication of

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
mu

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
only uh increases the size of z by some

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
factor k that is small

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,440
okay so this is the 2018 construction

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
but now um

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
i move on to uh the overview of the

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
security of this scheme so let's

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
consider some adversary a against the

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
informability game of this one time

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
signature

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
so a the adversary sees the public key v

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,720
and w

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
and then he sees a signature sigma of

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
some message mu

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
he produces a forgery for some message

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
mu prime which we call z prime this

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,640
forgery

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
and

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
now the challenger for uh this uh

80
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,319
unforge ability game knows uh the secret

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
key of the public key

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
so he knows the s and the y

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
uh corresponding to the v and w and then

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
he can compute a honestly

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,879
generated signature z which is mu prime

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,040
s plus y

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,519
of the same message mu prime now what we

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
can see is that we have two uh

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
signatures z and z prime that pass

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
verification and that

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
are signatures for this message mu

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
so we have uh a times z is equal to mu

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
prime v plus w and the same thing for

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
the z prime now to conclude that z minus

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
z prime is a solution to cs for a we

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,640
have to prove that

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
z minus z prime is not zero otherwise

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,599
this solution is trivial

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,840
so this is only the only thing that

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
remains to be proven

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
so the intuition why

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
z is not always equal to z prime meaning

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
that the adversary doesn't always output

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
a forgery that is the same as the one

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
that would have been honestly generated

106
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,480
by the

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
on the challenger is as follows

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
so the idea is we take parameters for

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
this scheme that are chosen so there

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
exists at least another pair a star y

111
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,399
star that verified the adversary's view

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
so the adversary's view is

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,918
um

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,840
is this so it's vw and the signature and

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,919
now what we say is that with the

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
parameters we take there exists at least

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
two pairs of vectors s y and s star y

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
star that verified this equation and

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
that have small norm

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,479
so

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
now from the adversary's perspective

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
both worlds meaning the world in which

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
the challenger sampled s and y and the

124
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
world in which the challenger sampled a

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
star and y star

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,960
are uh indistinguishable and therefore

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,680
the adversary cannot always

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,080
output z equals mu prime s plus y

129
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,520
or z prime equals mu prime s plus y and

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
sometimes he will pick the wrong one

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
which is a good one for the challenger

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
for us

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
and which is mu prime s star plus y star

134
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039
and so when this

135
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
event happens which happens with

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
probability at least half

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
then z is not equal to z prime and

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,479
therefore the challenger recovers a cis

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,919
solution for a

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,759
and then trigger one

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,320
okay so

142
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
we're not gonna use uh exactly this

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
scheme we're gonna use a slightly uh

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
different one so we

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,400
extend

146
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
the previous construction to gaussian

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
for the secret key meaning that uh so

148
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
our scheme the one we're gonna use in

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
the blind signature is exactly this one

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
time signature except the secret key

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
here is sampled from a gaussian

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
distribution rather than uniform with

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
small coefficients

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,479
so everything else is the same the

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
signature is the same the verification

156
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
is the same except the norm of z uh now

157
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
depends on these standard deviations

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,080
sigma s and sigma y

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
okay so now if we want to look at the

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
security of this gaussian version of the

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,479
one time signature

162
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,600
well uh we have to take a look at the

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
original uniform distribution

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
security which was just a few slides ago

165
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
so

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
what we wanted was

167
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
that the adversary's view which is vw in

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,479
the signature

169
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
the the design doesn't imply only one

170
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
solution for s and y which means that

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
the the

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
the challenger could have sampled either

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
of the solutions

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
and uh the advisory cannot cannot always

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
find which one

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
so now uh with uh gaussians it's

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,560
slightly different because um we cannot

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
like every that

179
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
since gaussians are not like of uh

180
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
not finite support just like the other

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
uh version um there exists uh some other

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
solutions uh that

183
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
uh come from the same distribution as s

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
and y and verifies uh these equations

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
except we want that uh there's not only

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,240
one solution that has non-negligible

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
probability because for example if the

188
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
gaussian

189
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
if the standard deviation sigma s and

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
sigma y are very small

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
then uh most likely there will be only

192
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
one uh solution which is the one that

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
was sampled s and y that verifies the

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
adversary's view

195
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,840
and now we just have to take siemens and

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,120
sigma y wide enough so there are many

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
solutions to

198
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
uh this equation

199
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,639
with non-negligible probability

200
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,919
uh

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,720
uh for for this distribution and when

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
this is done then we can conclude the

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,639
same way as we did before which is

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
the adversary can cannot information

205
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
theoretically uh find

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
uh always always find the the the

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
honestly generated signature

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,039
as a portrait

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,080
okay

210
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
so now i can move on to the second part

211
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
which is the blind signature uh which is

212
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
going to be built upon

213
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
this uh

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
one-time signature construction so first

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
just a few definitions on blind

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
signatures so in blind signature you

217
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
have two parties

218
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,799
uh you have a user and a signer

219
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
so after the interaction between the

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
user and the signer

221
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
the user should obtain a signature for

222
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,479
his message under the public key of the

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
signer now

224
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
it's not the only thing you want out of

225
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
blind signature you have some security

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
notions that you have to fulfill

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,399
so the first one is blindness which

228
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
means that designer

229
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
should not learn anything about the

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,640
message of the user and he should not uh

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,880
know from when he sees the blind

232
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
signature that is produced in the end he

233
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
shouldn't know during which interaction

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
this signature was

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
was produced and that's

236
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
obviously because the message is part of

237
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
uh like to verify the signature you have

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
to admit the message and if you can link

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,600
then

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
he learns uh something about the message

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
or the interview okay so the second one

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
is one more informability and uh it goes

243
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
as follows some after some uh

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
interactions say some number l of

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
interaction between uh the user and

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
designer the unit the the user should

247
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
only be able to produce

248
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
l signatures

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
uh

250
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
so basically you should not be able to

251
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,399
produce l plus one signatures because uh

252
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
well then there's at least one symmetry

253
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
there's uh

254
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
not not the result of an interaction of

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
a honest interaction between the server

256
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,080
and the

257
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,750
designer and the user

258
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,880
[Music]

259
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
okay

260
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,640
so

261
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
now the intuition of our construction so

262
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,839
let me just first present a naive

263
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
approach that is not going to um

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
fulfill the blindness

265
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
notion

266
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,079
so

267
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,079
let's see the public key is going to be

268
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
a collection of

269
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,760
and one time signature public keys so

270
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
here the one time signature is the

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
gaussian version of the 2018

272
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
construction that i talked about in the

273
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
first part of this talk

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
um

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,399
so

276
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
second the user will send his message to

277
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
designer so this is obviously not blind

278
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
then because the user just gives away

279
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
his message to designer we'll come back

280
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
to that later

281
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,240
um so designer just got the message and

282
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
you can compute the one-time signature

283
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,839
of this message

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,640
for

285
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
the if public key

286
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
of the scheme because the scheme is n

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
one time signature public key so it just

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,079
picks one it's actually a state which

289
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,760
you will update

290
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
every every round

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
during each interaction

292
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,279
so the signer sends this one-time

293
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,000
signature to the user and then the user

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
can compute

295
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,839
a zero knowledge proof

296
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,040
that

297
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
he got basically this one time signature

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
for some index so basically um the the

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,279
user recovers z from his interaction

300
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,959
with the server

301
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
so z is a one-time signature of his

302
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
message for one of the public keys and

303
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
then

304
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
he can prove

305
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
this statement here

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
and

307
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,440
this

308
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,959
should not

309
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,839
leak

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,399
which index it is

311
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
okay so now this was the uh non-blind

312
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,399
approach so there's a few things we have

313
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,360
to

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
change

315
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
so

316
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
first

317
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
uh

318
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
so the public is still just a collection

319
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
of n uh one time signature public keys

320
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
but now instead of sending directly his

321
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
message to designer the user will

322
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,800
encrypt it and send the cipher text to

323
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,519
the signer and a welfare net zero

324
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
knowledge proof

325
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
um to the signer now

326
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
before the signer had the message and so

327
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
he could compute the one type signature

328
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,000
directly but now he will homomorphically

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
compute this uh like an encryption of

330
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
the one-time signature

331
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
uh directly on the ciphertext

332
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
which you will send to the user and then

333
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,839
the user can

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
decrypt the designer's response and just

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
keep on just like on the naive approach

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
i just explained before

337
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,279
okay

338
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,959
so a little more uh specifically now

339
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,760
so the server setup is going to be

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
uh as follows so he samples a short

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
trapdoor

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
which is a matrix r and then he sets the

343
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
public key the public matrix a to be

344
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,519
constructed like this

345
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
which you might recognize

346
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,959
uh

347
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,120
allows him to use his trap door to

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
sample pre-images of vectors

349
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
and then uh he will sample uniformly

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
random vi in wi

351
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
uh which is going to be the public key

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
of the one time signature now you can

353
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
remember that in the one time signature

354
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,399
the

355
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,040
the the setup was you first sample the

356
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
matrix a

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
then you sample the secret key s and y

358
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
and you compute v and w as the public

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,320
key now here the server is going to do

360
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
it the other way around which is is

361
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
going to sample a with a trapdoor in it

362
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,200
then example v and w and com

363
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
sample a pre-image s and y a short

364
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
pre-image s and y from a gaussian that

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
is that is going to fulfill the same the

366
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
same equations as the

367
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,279
the one time signature so the public key

368
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,240
is just uh this matrix a and the vis and

369
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
w i's

370
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
and the secret key of the server is uh

371
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,279
this matrix r so as i just said for

372
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
every signature the the server will have

373
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,079
to sample a secret key s i and a y i

374
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,760
using the trapdoor

375
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
and um

376
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,680
for each signature the user should

377
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,240
generate a key pair for an encryption

378
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
scheme and run

379
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
the setup of the set membership proof uh

380
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
for every signature so even if he

381
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
interacts several times with uh the

382
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
server he should

383
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
have a different

384
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,880
uh

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
the server should not be able to link uh

386
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,639
every anyway

387
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,000
okay

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
um so uh

389
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,639
the blind signature itself so the

390
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
communication between the user and the

391
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
server is as follows so first the server

392
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
the user will um

393
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
has a some message mu which it will

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,079
encrypt into tnt prime using the public

395
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,399
key he just generated

396
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,839
and then he will compute his hero

397
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,680
knowledge proof that the ciphertext is

398
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
well formed and it will send everything

399
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,839
to the to the

400
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,480
signer

401
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,440
so the signer has some state i between

402
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
zero and n minus one

403
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,399
um so he first verifies this will form

404
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
this proof and if the verification

405
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,839
passes then he will

406
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,760
sample uh the secret key from the

407
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
one-time signature which is s-i-n-y-i

408
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
from gaussians

409
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,719
uh verifying uh this equation here

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
um and next he will compute an

411
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,199
encryption of the one-time signature of

412
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,440
mu directly on the ciphertext he

413
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
received from

414
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
the user

415
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
and it will update

416
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
a state and send the save text to the

417
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,279
user

418
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
so the user received the ciphertext

419
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,519
which he decrypts and gets

420
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
a one-time signature for his message

421
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,639
under

422
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
the if public key

423
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
of the of the server

424
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
the signer

425
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
so first he verifies that indeed there

426
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
is an index for which

427
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,959
he has a valid one-time signature

428
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,720
and then he will compute this uh this uh

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,399
zero knowledge proof

430
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,079
um that he

431
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,839
the of the of the statement i just said

432
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,920
which is he has one

433
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
uh valid one-time signature for one of

434
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,399
the indes and one of the indices

435
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
okay so

436
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,720
that was the the the idea of the of the

437
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
blind signature scheme now i'll just

438
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,800
explain a little more about what the

439
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,120
encryption scheme is and how the

440
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
uh computation on the ciphertext is done

441
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,320
so first just uh two slides you can

442
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
pause the video if you want to read

443
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,759
further about this uh encryption scheme

444
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,920
but the idea here is

445
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
that this encryption scheme is a rec of

446
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
type uh encryption

447
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,759
and uh

448
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,519
so the signer can homomorphically

449
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,480
compute

450
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,160
uh an encryption of the

451
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
of the of the of the

452
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,759
one-time signature um of the message mu

453
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,800
because it's uh linear so if he uh

454
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,959
computes capital f and f prime this way

455
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
so just

456
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,120
the

457
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
the the encryption of a vector is just

458
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,439
the encryption of every coordinate of

459
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,959
the vector

460
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
okay

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
so

462
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
the adversary can do this now there's a

463
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,720
one run problem which is uh this leaks

464
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,799
the the secret key of the signer and

465
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,160
this is not something you want because

466
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
this would break uh one more

467
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,320
one more

468
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,799
unforgetability

469
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,160
so now to fix this uh problem we use uh

470
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
drowning which is

471
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
uh as follows so we generate so the

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
server would generate an encryption of

473
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
zero with a wide enough gaussian noises

474
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
so first we'll sample

475
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
uh y y prime and y prime with uh

476
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
independent gaussian coefficients and

477
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,280
then he will compute some masks so we

478
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,559
have

479
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,280
this capital m and m prime which are

480
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
basically encryptions of zero

481
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
except the distribution of the noises uh

482
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,720
during a honest encryption say is

483
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
supposed to have a different

484
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
distribution

485
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,160
but

486
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,000
so here it's a white gaussians

487
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
and then he will compute capital f and f

488
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
prime

489
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,120
as

490
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
the this as we just shown here

491
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,440
plus

492
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
the masks which are encryptions of zero

493
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,000
and therefore the decryption of f

494
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
under some other conditions i'm going

495
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
not going to

496
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
mention

497
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,600
further here

498
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
um this

499
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
the the decryption still gives um

500
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
z the one time signature of the message

501
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
mu

502
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,600
okay so now just a final slide about uh

503
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
the parameters

504
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,320
um of our scheme so you have everything

505
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
here it's a screenshot from the

506
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
from the paper

507
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
so you can

508
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
pause the video and read if you want to

509
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,960
see

510
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
okay thank you very much bye
