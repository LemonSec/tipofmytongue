00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,040
hi

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,880
i'm peter kotosch i'm going to present

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,640
the paper on the esogenic problem

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
exploration point information

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,559
which is jon's work with the taco bell

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,920
spots are simultaneous

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,560
so our main contribution is that there's

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
an algorithm for finding the secret

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,950
misogyny

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,880
[Music]

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,439
in essentially any siddha time scheme

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,119
uh given the anamorphism rings of the

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,199
starting and the target curve

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,279
and utilizing the torsion

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,800
in a meaningful way

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
previously this was only known when the

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,120
srgs were particularly short and did

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,919
nothing positive

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
our attacks actually helped in analyzing

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120
the security of b-side and show that

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
these side partners are tight and they

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,719
cannot be lowered without

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
breaking the parameter sets

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
isogenomics miscrypto is a branch of

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,680
post quantum crypto

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,039
and it's based on the hardness of

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,120
finding a misogynist between supersonic

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
curves

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,200
um however in most cases

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
isogenic based systems are based on

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,799
relaxations of this problem

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,680
um

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
namely for example in sidh additional

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
torsion point information is provided

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
isogynamic systems are are

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
have the nice feature that they have

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,960
small key sizes so they're public key

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
cyber tax signatures are all small

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
compared to their post quantum

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
alternatives

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
so let me present the schemas idh

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
in some detail so let n1 and m2 be two

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
large smooth numbers um

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
usually they're powers of two and three

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,200
but that's not quite necessary and the p

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,759
is n one times n two minus one uh

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
sometimes there's also a small cofactor

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,799
there

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
and the the starting curve is a defined

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
over f p square

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
and then

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
uh alice's secret is an isogeny going

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
from e zero to the curve ea and bob's

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
secret uh is an isogeny going from e

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,239
zero to eb

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,080
uh however just knowing the co-domains

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,599
of these misogynists is not actually

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
enough to

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,959
to find a common shared secret

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,720
so what they do is they reveal extra

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,520
information namely alice reveals uh the

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,319
action of her misogyny on bob's torsion

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
point the torsion generators and

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
bob does the same with his secret

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,959
misogyny

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,080
and then they both can actually compute

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,239
the curve e over a b

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
where a corresponds to the secret kernel

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
uh of alice and b corresponds to the

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
secret kernel bob

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
and then their shared curve is this

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,879
curve ea b

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
so in this idh these isogenys are rather

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
short so

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
since n one times n two is dropped for p

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
uh and and one is roughly the same size

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,599
as n2 then both are roughly the size

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,879
square root of p

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
and in general uh if you restrict

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,959
yourself to powers of two and three uh

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
you do not expect uh such short um

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,680
isogen is to exist uh between two random

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
super singlet occurs

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
so the main contribution of p side is to

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
use a different type of parent percep

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
family where n1 is roughly into an

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,920
instructor p

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
so

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
this is achieved by choosing a prime so

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
there's a p square minus one is and one

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
times sentence times some small cofactor

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
to make this scheme efficient one

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
actually has to work with curves in

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
their uh twists on simultaneously so

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
twist of a curve is actually a curve

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
that's isomorphic to the curve

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280
uh

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
over the algebraic closure but i'm not

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
isolating the direct square

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,519
and

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,879
and the main trick here is that you can

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
actually carry out all the computations

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
over at p square and you don't have to

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
go to fp to the fourth

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,200
in the computation

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
however finding parameters for b side is

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
much harder than for sidh so you can no

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
longer actually expect n1 and 2 to be a

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,360
powers of two and three

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
uh you can make them smooth numbers but

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,599
it's uh it's a lot of work and uh

112
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
they're much less boost than inside the

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,959
h so it's slower than sidh but

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
uh it has some nice features so for

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
example keys are much smaller than

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,519
inside the h

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
now let me recall some hard problems in

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
isogenic crypto so we have a pure

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,199
isogenic problem

120
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,720
which is given uh when it's given

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
through curves and one has to compute

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,479
the misogyny between them

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
then you have the ssit problem where uh

124
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,400
not only the two pairs are given but

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
also degrees specified

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,759
two of them

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,840
and you also

128
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,199
know the action of the supervised

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
argument on some portion and the goal

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
again is

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
the secret misogyny

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
finally you have the anamorphism ring

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
problem uh namely one is given the super

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
similarly clarifying it's a morphism and

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
this anamorphism ring has a very

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
particular structure so every

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
supersymmetric curve

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,199
has the property that this endomorphism

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
is actually a maximum whether in certain

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
algebra

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
and

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
this correspondence was first discovered

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,840
by doring

144
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
back in 1930s and it's a really nice

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
correspondence because for

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
it's a categorical equivalence there

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
many of the notions in the iso and the

148
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,360
optical setting have their counterparts

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
in the quaternion setting

150
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
so for example a super single the curve

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
defined over a square corresponds to

152
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
maximum order and the quaternion algebra

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
ratified at p and infinity

154
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
and isogeny going from e1 to e1

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
corresponds to the left ideal of the

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
first and the more physical which is

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
denoted by one which is also

158
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
simultaneously a right ideal of the

159
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
second and the markov 2.

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,800
in particular when t tie is a separable

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
endomorphism

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
and this will correspond to a principal

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
idea

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
of the endomorphism

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,800
um so finally the the set of isogenes uh

166
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
going from e1 to e2 have some structure

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
and you can add disargument between

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
these first

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
this is denoted by homeowner 2 and this

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
is actually a rank 4 zed like this

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
both in the isogeny independent setting

172
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
the interesting algorithm property of

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,080
the boring correspondence is that

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
it doesn't have the same difficulty in

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
both directions

176
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
so actually uh computing uh the

177
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,039
anamorphism ring of super single curve

178
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
is supposed to be hard so there are only

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
exponential time algorithm for this fact

180
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,919
but if one is given a maximum order then

181
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
one can actually compute

182
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
the corresponding elliptic curve in

183
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
polynomial time

184
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
so now i will give you a brief um

185
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,440
discussion how

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
the reduction from endomorphism

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
confrontation to isolate computation

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,919
works

189
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
so actually in the quaternion setting

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
finding a connecting idea was easy

191
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
however if you want to translate into a

192
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
misogyny setting you need one more

193
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
smooth norm and this is exactly what the

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,759
the algorithm of coilouter pertinento

195
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,479
abbreviated klpt does so it takes a

196
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,840
connecting ideal and computes an

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,319
equivalent idea of the smooth work

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,280
and

199
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
so this is a heuristic polynomial time

200
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
algorithm and the recently was shown by

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
vasilovsky that you can actually remove

202
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,120
the underlying heuristic and replace it

203
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
with something much more standard and

204
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
maybe even generalized female hypothesis

205
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
so how does the general reduction work

206
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,639
so so now suppose that i know the

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
endomorphism ring of both hers how can i

208
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,960
compute misogyny between them so i

209
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
compute the connecting ideal then i

210
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,759
compute an equivalent ideal of smooth

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,599
storm using klpt and then there is a

212
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,000
generate procedure how you can translate

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
uh a connecting ideal to

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
nysogen

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,879
so however in in sidh type schemes which

216
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,599
is sidh or b-side or any

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,000
variation of sidh

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
you have one particular secret isogeny

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
that's your secret so it's not a

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
priority clear that if you know an

221
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
isogeny if you need to curse you can

222
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
actually also compute

223
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
the secret isolation

224
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,039
and the first result in this reaction

225
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
was by galbraith patricia on the

226
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
internet who showed that in sidh you can

227
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
actually

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,039
uh find the secret by searching in

229
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
formula time if the anamorphism rings of

230
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,520
the e0 and the a are also known

231
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
and the key ingredient is that is this

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
again this fact that the nsidh isologies

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
are short common sense

234
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
so namely how does this algorithm work

235
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
so you compute the connecting item you

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
don't need to smooth it out just any

237
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
correct

238
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,279
then you find the shortest vector that's

239
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,440
connecting might be in parallel and then

240
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
with a really really large probability

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
this will actually be just the secret

242
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
isogeny um

243
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
in sidh

244
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
so this uses the fact that usually if

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,640
you just have two curves then the the

246
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
smallest element in this lattice will

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,399
have one roughly square to p

248
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,519
which is no longer the case for example

249
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
on b side or maybe other variants where

250
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
the isolationist might be longer so this

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
this uh this attack doesn't apply to

252
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
those uh those variants

253
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
so our main goal is actually to

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
generalize this algorithm

255
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,279
uh to be able to handle arbitrarily

256
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
large uh isogenes

257
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
uh but uh

258
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
so the previous algorithm didn't use the

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
torsion point information at all just

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,160
the fact that the isogen is particularly

261
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,440
short

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,279
we'll be using the conversion point

263
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,279
information in a much more in a

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
meaningful way here

265
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
so again we start with an ll reduced

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
basis of the connecting idea which we

267
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
denote by wi

268
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,399
and then these have isogenic

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,600
counterparts which builds up by phi i

270
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
and then we'll be looking for the phi as

271
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
a linear combination of these isogens

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
so this is sum of

273
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,440
i x i phi i and we're looking for the x

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
i

275
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
okay so we know

276
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
uh we can evaluate the phi on the n2

277
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
version so you know what phi p is

278
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
so we evaluate both sides uh here or of

279
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
this equation

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
q

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
and then

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,399
so so now we have four equations and we

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
have four variables

284
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
uh but the system is not linear however

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
it can be turned into a linear system

286
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
namely by using pairings and solving

287
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
discrete logarithms

288
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
solving discrete logarithms in this

289
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
context is not hard because usually n2

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
is smooth

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
plus

292
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
if not but in most applications n2 has

293
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
to be smooth but if uh if not then you

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
can invoke the fact and use a quantum

295
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
algorithm for solving logarithms

296
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,200
and then

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,440
so you actually have now a system for

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
four equations four variables module one

299
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
two and you can repeat the dxi what you

300
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
learned

301
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
so there are actually a lot of uh

302
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
unanswered questions uh with this

303
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
approach uh the first one is how to

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,519
evaluate the phi eye so so those phi i

305
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,880
they correspond to some abstract

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
components which are a corresponding lll

307
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
basis of the connection ideal so there's

308
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
no guarantee that they're normally

309
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,120
smooth so so so how can you actually

310
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,839
evaluate this phi i efficiently

311
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
the second one is

312
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
it's clear that the system of linear

313
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
equations has a solution because there

314
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
is there is a correct exercise

315
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
but why is this uh

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
solution unique

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
and the third one

318
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
is okay so i know the i module went to

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
how does this help me in finding phi

320
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
so first uh how we evaluate one smooth

321
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
degree estrogen is between two curves of

322
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
doing in the morphism ring so the key

323
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
ingredient is actually an algorithm by

324
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
 and also which

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,000
deal with the special case where uh

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
you have a curve of known endomorphism

327
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,959
ring and you want to evaluate an

328
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
endomorphism that

329
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
might not have a smooth degree

330
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
so the key id there is essentially you

331
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
can represent it as a linear combination

332
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
of endomorphisms which which are

333
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
evaluatable and then you just evaluate

334
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,240
those and then use the linear

335
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
combination to evaluate the non-smooth

336
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,920
degree one

337
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
and we'll be reducing to this fact

338
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
so iji the uh

339
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,079
uh

340
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
the the left ideal corresponding to

341
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
these phi i

342
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
and and the main idea is to use klpt to

343
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
compute an equivalent ideal k

344
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
uh

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
between one and o two so the main

346
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
component here on in the isogeny setting

347
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
is to following

348
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,360
so

349
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
so you have an isogenifyi that might not

350
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,040
have smooth form

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
but going from e1 to it

352
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
then from e2 to e1 you compute the

353
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200
smallest degree isogeny using klpt

354
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
and then if you compose the two you get

355
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
them in the organism of the first curve

356
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
which you can evaluate using particular

357
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
and then essentially you just have to

358
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
cut off

359
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
the part of the smooth one and then

360
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
you'll get the evaluation

361
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,320
uh of

362
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
the of the phi i so this is exactly what

363
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,839
we do here on the inside so you compute

364
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,920
the the product of j i with the

365
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
conjugate of case this is just k and

366
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,220
[Music]

367
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
and then

368
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
the main component here again is that

369
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,000
you can evaluate these theta i

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,880
now

371
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,519
and uh you and then you can evaluate the

372
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
phi k as well because it has music and

373
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
then you have to multiply with with the

374
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
inverse of m because when you cut off

375
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
you you added

376
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
multiplication by m there so that's why

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
it is crucial that the norm of m is

378
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
called prime to n2 for this to work

379
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
okay so now we can evaluate one smooth

380
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
decrease budget is why is the solution

381
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
unique

382
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
so

383
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
even though there are many different

384
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
non-isomorphic maximum orders in

385
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
equatorial algebra bp infinity they all

386
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
share one common thing namely if you

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
reduce them when you low into

388
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
you always get the same thing it will be

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
isomorphic to the two times the matrix

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
used modulo and two

391
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
uh furthermore so the main ingredient

392
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,760
now is this fact and another fact if you

393
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,079
take two curves there is always an

394
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,000
isogeny between them

395
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
whose degree is actually co-prime to n2

396
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
which means that if you represent the

397
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,660
action of that isogeny

398
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,240
[Music]

399
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
with with some fixed basis you get an

400
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,639
invertible matrix

401
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
so now if you want to get a specific

402
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
action from the until version which is

403
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
again represented by a matrix uh two

404
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
times two matrix

405
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
then what you do is you you take this m

406
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
psi and then you pre-compose it

407
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,839
with m psi inverse times that particular

408
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,440
action which you do have because the the

409
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,959
endomorphism ring would you lend to

410
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
contains all the matrices

411
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,360
so now you can actually get any type of

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
action with the instant version

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
furthermore you can you'll get each

414
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
action once because you only have

415
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,560
n two to the four possibilities uh as an

416
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
action

417
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,279
because every isogeny is a linear

418
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
combination of these phi i

419
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,920
and

420
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,959
what only

421
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
matters is the the residue class of the

422
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,360
x i would give line two

423
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
so you only have n two to the four

424
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,199
choices you you get them each of them so

425
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
there's only one

426
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
uh one particular choice for a

427
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
particular matrix

428
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,760
okay and uh now if you know these xi

429
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,079
modulus how does that help

430
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,560
in finding pi

431
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,759
so the main idea is is if you use lll

432
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,639
has a feature that

433
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
if you have a short vector in the

434
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,360
lattice it it's actually

435
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
if you write it in the spaces the

436
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,279
coefficients corresponding to the basis

437
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,920
vector are also relatively short

438
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,199
and this ensures that

439
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,399
using this fact you can actually prove

440
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
certain settings or certain conditions

441
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
are satisfied which is that n1 over n2

442
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
is smaller than d over 16 where d is the

443
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,199
shortest size ideally between the two

444
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
curves

445
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
that you can you can recover the x i as

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,839
integers as well because you can show

447
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,600
that x i

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,680
uh will just be in the inner interval

449
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
minus m two over two and n two over two

450
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,560
and there's only one residue there

451
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
uh so every residue module n2 only

452
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
appears once there so if you know the

453
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
exci mode you want to you know as an

454
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
integer as well

455
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,959
and this condition and 1 over n2 being

456
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
smaller than d over 16 is not very

457
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
restrictive because you can actually

458
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
assume that

459
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
n2 is bigger than one since you're

460
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
attacking a key exchange

461
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,330
you're attacking

462
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,639
[Music]

463
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
but this is actually

464
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
even

465
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,959
tells even more that you don't even

466
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,639
really need to utilize all the torsion

467
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
information as usual d

468
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
in general is roughly square to the p

469
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
so this essentially works for any sidh

470
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
type scheme

471
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
uh interestingly you never use the fact

472
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,839
that n1 is smooth of course if you want

473
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,079
the isogeny as a rational map you needed

474
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
one to be smooth but

475
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
what this algorithm actually does is

476
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
is returns a linear combination of these

477
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
phi i uh

478
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
so you can retrieve this renewal linear

479
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,199
combination even if the the isogen is

480
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
not a smooth degree

481
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,640
so to summarize

482
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
we generalize the gpsc effect so much

483
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
larger classifies idea style schemes

484
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,080
utilizing distortion point information

485
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
furthermore we provide an algorithm for

486
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,480
evaluating non-smooth degree estrogens

487
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
between two curves of known anamorphism

488
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,240
links which might be up in the interest

489
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,919
so finally this this work provides

490
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,080
an attack on b side which is more

491
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
efficient than meat in the middle

492
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
not in terms of running time it has the

493
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
same running time

494
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
but

495
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
it it's completely memory free compared

496
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,919
to uh meets the middle algorithms which

497
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,080
need exponential memory and it is

498
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
actually as important to be much faster

499
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
than

500
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
so it doesn't lead to an attack on these

501
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
sides because these side printers are

502
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,200
actually

503
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
chosen very carefully

504
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,239
to avoid these types of attacks

505
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,840
but it shows that you cannot lower these

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
side parameters which is an important

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
fact because uh

508
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
b side if you if you if you can choose

509
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,400
smaller primes

510
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,520
for for b side then the efficiency of b

511
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,799
side

512
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,640
gains a lot as you can choose and one

513
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
and then two to be much smoother

514
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
and the prime also gets smaller

515
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
but this attack shows that this would be

516
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
very answering

517
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,679
thank you much for your attention
