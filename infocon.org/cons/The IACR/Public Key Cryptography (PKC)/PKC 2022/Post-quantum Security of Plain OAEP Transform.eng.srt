00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,880
hello everyone i'm asan and ryami a

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,759
post-doctoral research and university

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,120
i'm working in the department of

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,639
computer science

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,120
i'm telling you about

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,799
our paper

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,000
uh

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
that is accepted to pkc 2022

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
uh for the rest of the presentation i

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,680
will tear off my video since i might

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,599
cover it might cover some part of this

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,080
stuff so

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
all right um

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,719
so

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
oap is a transformation that uses two

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,719
random vocals

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,120
and a partial domain one representation

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
to obtain and

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
and distinguish a cca secure encryption

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,839
scheme

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,039
how does it work in order to encrypt the

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
message m we append

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
a zero with a string of lengths k1 into

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
m

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
and

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
choose a randomness r then

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
we query g on r to get g of r and x

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
sorry with the message

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
this part is called s

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,520
then we query h on input s and x sorry

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
with r this part is called t

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,119
and

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
then apply f on input s and t

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,080
to get the ciphertext

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
how

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
how the decryption works

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,920
we use inverse of f to get s and t and

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,119
then

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
h of s xor with d gives us the

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,200
randomness r and xoring s with q 4 gives

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
us the message back

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,880
[Music]

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
but what is in distinguish with cca

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
security means

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
uh

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
in another local model

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
possibly you are familiar with this

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
security notion so i briefly

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,959
i briefly explained it here both

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,520
adversary and challenger have access to

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
random oracles adversary

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
given pk has access to decryption

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
queries

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
also and

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
later

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,599
uh the adversary outputs to message the

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,920
m091

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
the challenger encrypts one of them

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
randomly to get cs4 and sends a thought

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,879
adversary

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
and advances goal is to guess which

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
message has been encrypted obviously as

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
they say is not allowed to ask for

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
decryption of csr because cherie the

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
adversary can guess can obtain me with

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
the property one

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
if it's allowed to

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
to make a

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,879
decryption query on input to cstr

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
how security proves

71
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
are done usually in the random oracle

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,440
model

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
so the assumption is that there is a

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
public

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
truly random function

76
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,840
that all parties including adversary can

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,519
calculate and in the security proof

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,920
usually a list of inputs and output

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
queries to run oracle is needed

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
and also we need to

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
adaptively

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
change

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,080
the random call in the security group

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
or program or a programmed random word

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
security group

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,019
[Music]

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
i'll give you

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
uh

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
i give you a reason why we need to

90
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
consider quantum random working models

91
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
so since in the real

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
world applications the random oracle

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
will be replaced with the cryptographic

94
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
hash function and the code of this hash

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,200
function is public

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
the quantum adversary can implement this

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
hash function is constantly y so

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
we need to consider

99
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,720
[Music]

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,519
the proposition axis

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
also position queries

102
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
to the random oracle

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
[Music]

104
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
the second argument

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,840
may not work

106
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,120
trivially because uh recording

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,080
contemporaries

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
uh are not possible in general due to an

109
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,479
oakland thorium

110
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,960
so this this uh

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
parties

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,880
is difficult to hold in a quantum case

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
the third property

114
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
or

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,800
that

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
adopting uh

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
adapt adaptively program the random work

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,479
might not be

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,240
obvious as well since

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
a single superposition query can contain

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
all the inputs outputs of the random

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
oracle

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
and

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
a programming language

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
otherwise might not be plus so

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
when we say make such a query and then

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
we try to

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
change the output of uh random workflow

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
in one specific input or a programming

130

world

131
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,320
then this might be detectable that say

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
since it has been created before

133
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,280
[Music]

134
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
existing research

135
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
prior to our work

136
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
shows that

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
a modified oap

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
that is called qoap

139
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
is in distinguishes cca in a quantum

140
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,599
manual

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,080
qap uses an external random oracle

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
in this way

143
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
so it's almost the same as where px

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
accepting the cypher text c2 that is

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
obtained by query

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,720
and url numerical h prime

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
so querying h prime input smt gives us

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,440
the

149
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
second cyber ciphertext that is c2

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
this extra

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
this extra random local

need

153
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
is needed to overcome the recording

barrier

155
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
in the paper and it has been used for

156
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,210
extraction of smt in the security proof

one way to hiding lemma has been has

been used that is

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
it's a tool to

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,198
to work on third challenge

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
we improve the existing result in two

166
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
forms first we show

167
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
in distinguished qcci security that is

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
stronger than that distinguishes cca

169
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,160
second we show

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
the post-content security of unmodified

171
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
oap

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
and the technique that the techniques

173
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
that have been used

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,440
uh in our paper

175
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
are champions recording technique and

176
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,319
its follow-up works

177
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,970

[Music]

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
so what is in distinguishing qcci

180
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
security in a quantum random oracle

181
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,400
model

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,840
it's uh shown it is showing this slide

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,639
uh

184
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
quantum adversary here has super

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
position access to the random vocals

186
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,080
also the decryption

187
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,039
and adversaries code is you guess

188
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
the b2b

189
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
i will explain

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,050
this quantum matrix in in the next slide

[Music]

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
so canonical way of querying a classical

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
function or

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
h a classical function h or implementing

edge

196
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
quantum computer is to

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
prepare two registers one input register

198
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
and one output and then

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
the basis of static at x and y goes to

200
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,800
cat x and y x or f of x

201
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160
so evaluation of f1 input x is a stored

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,520
in the biologist

203
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,240
for decryption queries is similar with

204
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
the difference that if the challenge

205
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
query csr is defined

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
and submit it as a query dedication

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
query as a decryption query

208
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,040
then the decryption oracle returns but

209
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
so it doesn't

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,279
doesn't

211
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,399
decrypt the css and history is classical

212
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
cyborg so this unitary is defined

213
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,040
it's well defined

214
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,399
[Music]

215
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
i give you a very short introduction to

216
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
the compressed standard robot of course

217
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
i'm not the right person to

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,399
present this and

219
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
more more information is available in

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
the original paper

221
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
the csto is

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
if i want to summarize this properties

223
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
efficient

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
with the source input and output of

225
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
queries in a shared database shared i

226
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,200
mean it's shared with adversarial

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
and it's perfectly distinguishing from

228
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
the

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
standard world

230
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
i explained the high level idea of the

231
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
csto this representation lacks details

232
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
and it's not

233
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
and in this representation

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
the implementation is not efficient it's

235
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
just to build the intuition behind the

236
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
csto

237
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
so the standard way of

238
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
considering a

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,700
quantum random problem is to

240
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,240
[Music]

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
add oracle choose a random function from

242
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
the set of all functions and the

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
answer the queries with the unitary u

244
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
sub edge

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
that is a like standard way of

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
implementing edge

247
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,200
on a quantum computer

248
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
another perspective is that

249
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
the oracle puts uniform superposition of

250
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
all functions in his private register

251
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
and answer the query

252
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,079
as shown

253
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,040
in the start slide

254
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
so uh these two perspective or

255
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
are the same since

256
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
if for instance i measure

257
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
the oracle basically if oracle measures

258
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
the

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
it's private is just saying

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,959
perspective two

261
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,160
then

262
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
it gets the same ensemble of quantum

263
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
state as the perspective one or

264
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
you you can say that one

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
one is the purification of the other

266
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
ones

267
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,959
now if

268
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
if we apply qft quantum fourier

269
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
transform

270
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
and wireless before and after

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,040
query

272
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,040
during the runway

273
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,319
we'll get the phaser

274
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
with the change of notation

275
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
from a random function h to its truth

276
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,760
table

277
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
and

278
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
considering the point function and piece

279
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
of x and y

280
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
uh where the point function is the

281
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,240
function that like p sub x and y is the

282
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
function that

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
it's

284
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,680
y on input x and it's zero elsewhere

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
uh we will get the state

286
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
showing the slide

287
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
differences has been

288
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,430
shown by the blue color

289

[Music]

290
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,639
now if the oracle applies qft on his

291
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
priority just said the point function

292
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
is stored in the oracle state

293
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
in other words

294
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
the pair x the pair very x and y is

295
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,279
stored

296
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
in the oracologist

297
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,839
and um yeah of course this is this high

298
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,360
level

299
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
like high level idea of the csto and

300
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
its original

301
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
the origin the original representation

302
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720
and definition is quite different from

303
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
here

304
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
but

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
at the end

306
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
we will get something like this that

307
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,720
there is a database

308
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
that is shared between adversary and

309
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,839
oracle and the queries are restored in

310
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,360
this database

311
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,240
[Music]

312
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,839
basically the

313
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,000
database is entangled with both parts

314
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
[Music]

315
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
i'll give you

316
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
the overview of the proof so we start

317
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
with the indistinguishable pcca game in

318
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,480
a quantum random oracle model

319
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
then we introduce a sequence of

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
indistinguishable games

321
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
to reach the last game for which the

322
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,800
success probability of the adversary is

323
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,079
half

324
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
and that finishes the proof because

325
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
the games basically the games that were

326
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
introduced for instinctual and the last

327
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
game probability of the success property

328
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
is half so we'll get the overall

329
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
probability of

330
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
like

331
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,360
winning that winning the game and

332
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
distinguished kcc game is one

333
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
half plus negative

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,760
so game zero is in essentially qcca game

335
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
and a quantum random oracle model

336
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,399
the first time is

337
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
for assigning the random elements and

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
the rest is

339
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
the attack in which a

340
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,800
wants to guess the b2b that is chosen

341
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
randomly by the challenge

342
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,920
[Music]

343
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
in game one the random vocal h is

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
replaced with

345
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
uh compresses and local h

346
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
and random vocal g is replaced with the

347
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
random injective function since

348
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,199
these replacements are in distinguishing

349
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,000
for a

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,040
for a polygon point on this again the

351
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680

the mdh

and then

381
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,360
when getting t it sets your

the basic of zero here

391
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,480
so basically

392
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
for the pace that the decryption

there is such a there are such

two games are indistinguishable because

m sub ph

405
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
uh and the

description of the deck

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,720
f inverse almost commute your

408
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,559
due to a

recent result

410
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,839
and

411
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
and because mdh is an evolution so if

412
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,960
we commute

413
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
one of one and the edge with u dec f

414
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
inverse then they will cancel out and

415
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
we will get the udec

f universe

417
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,720
so these two games are in this

418
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
in game three we replace the random

419
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
morphology with

420
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
the compressed sandal

so cstog

424

and obviously game two and 3 are

425
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
indistinguishable because of the genres

426

searched

528
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
so this decryption doesn't use the

529
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
inverse of f at all and

530
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,320
it checks if this

531
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,600
if there are pairs of in a database that

532
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,719
these two condition holds

533
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,180
[Music]

534
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
it's not difficult to see these two

535
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,640
decryption returns the same out because

536
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
the pure purified measurements mdh and

537
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,679
g also looks for such a page in a

538
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,520
database

539
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,919
and once there are such a such

540
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,600
appearance then

541
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,360
basically the output of you take every

542
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,240
inversion and the output of the

543
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
this new decryption or

544
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,679
exactly the end most significant bits of

545
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,960
g4 x-rays

546
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
[Music]

547
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,440
and finally the last game we measure the

548
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,159
queries random

549
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,200
g

550
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,720
with the projected measurement m or star

551
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,600
so the output of the measurement is one

552
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
if

553
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
if the post measurement is

554
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
or a store

555
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,159
and otherwise it's zero

556
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,960
if the output is one

557
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
that group one of the measurement is one

558
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
then

559
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
uh we are bored return a random bit

560
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
otherwise we can see

561
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,679
so this is the way to prevent adversary

562
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,400
to

563
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
to query

564
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
the rsr to the random or gucci

565
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,849
[Music]

566
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,919
for the

567
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
to show that game six and seven are

568
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,120
indistinguishable for the queries before

569
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
the challenge query

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,600
we use a gentle measurement lemma

571
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,159
and for post challenge queries we will

572
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,600
use

573
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,360
uh we'll use it we reduce it to the

574
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
partial domain one radius of the

575
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,650
permutation f

576
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,960
[Music]

577
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
so uh

578
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,200
uh like

579
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
with another with an adversary that

580
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
distinguish these two games we construct

581
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
a missouri that breaks the security of

582
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
the permutation error

583
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
note here the decryption queries

584
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,679
are answered

585
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,240
with the only data is of

586
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
the h and dg so it doesn't use the

587
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
inverse of f

588
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
so the reduction can be done because of

589
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,480
this because

590
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
every we don't we don't need the

591
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
basically the secret key

592
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,360
to to answer the decryption queries

593
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
and finally the final step is

594
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,880
since the success probability of the

595
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
adversary in games

596
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,159
seven is one over two and

597
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,159
the games are indistinguishable the

598
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,520
proof

599
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,799
is complete

600
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
and why the success probability name

601
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
seven is

602
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
is one over two because

603
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,600
rsr and subsequently

604
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
our star is

605
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,080
basically they are a random value from

606
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
the at the same perspective so

607
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,080
uh the

608
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,760
pizza b is

609
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,799
hidden
