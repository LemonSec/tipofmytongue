1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
of pkc 2022

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,160
uh let me introduce uh first embedded

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
speaker dr dustin murray

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
uh dr dustin molly is a mathematician in

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,719
the mixed computer science uh as a

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,119
computer security division or he

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,080
received his phd from the university

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
university of washington in 2009

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,640
uh his area of research deals always

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,359
repeat curves and all the applications

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
in cryptography uh dr murray is the post

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
quantum cryptography project and nist

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
and today he'll

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,239
talk about the latest stages of missed

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
pqc standardization oh let's welcome dr

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
dustin

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
thank you very much for the introduction

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,199
hopefully you can see and hear the

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,760
slides let me know if not

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,559
um yeah thankful to be able to speak on

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,800
behalf of nist and our post quantum

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,120
cryptography team

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
it would be nice if we could all be

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
there together for pkc in in japan it

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,600
was

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
six years ago in japan when

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
um i went to give a talk that kicked off

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
the nest post quantum cryptography

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,360
standardization process

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
um it's been a long six years and i

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
did not know what was in store for me

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
when we uh started this off

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,880
so i titled this talk the beginning of

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
the end

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
um sounds a little bit ominous i've been

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,520
told

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
i called it that because we're nearing

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
the end of the third round of our

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
process

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
and at the end of the third round we

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,479
will of course name some algorithms that

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
we will be standardizing so the

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,600
competition

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
is uh getting close to

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
reaching some kind of a stopping point

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
of course it's not completely the end

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,680
i'll talk about

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
more work that will continue to go on

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
um

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,399
i will so the outline for my talk i will

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,719
talk about what is our pqc

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
standardization process

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
what's happened during the last six

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
years

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
when will nist announce the results

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
i'm sure some of you were hoping that

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
today would be the day and i was hoping

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,000
so as well

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
when i was invited to give this talk at

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,560
pkc

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
it was a goal to try and get our

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
announcement ready that hasn't quite

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,319
happened yet it'll probably be a couple

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
more weeks

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
and so we hope by the end of the month

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
to be able to announce the algorithms

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
that we will select

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
so i'll talk a little bit about that and

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,879
what the future holds as well

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
so is motivation i'm sure many of you

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,239
are probably aware of this but back in

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,480
the 90s there were some very influential

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
and foundational

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
research that was being done

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,879
that helped spur research into a new

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,080
field

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
of course this refers to peter shore's

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
algorithm in 1994

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
they gave a exponential speed up when

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
using a quantum computer

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,159
to solve some problems that we care

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,959
about for cryptography particularly for

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,800
public key cryptography

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
shorts algorithm if you have a large

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,159
enough computer to implement it

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,360
efficiently

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
could solve two different problems first

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
it would be able to factor large

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
integers

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
and second it could solve the discrete

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
log problem

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
of course we know both of those are the

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
basis for various public key

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
cryptosystems that we use in practice

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,760
another algorithm which is important is

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
grover's algorithm

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
it was not

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
an exponential speed up but it was also

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
a quantum algorithm that gave a

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
polynomial speed up an unstructured

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
search

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
so both of these algorithms they impact

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
some of the cryptography that we have at

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
nist

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
in particular nist has various public

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,879
key cryptography standards

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
we've standardized

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,360
a key establishment that includes

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
encryption as well as key exchange like

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
the diffie-hellman

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
and we also have various digital

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
signatures standardized

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
and with schwarz algorithm every single

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
one of those algorithms in our standards

115
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,199
would be vulnerable to attacks from a

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,358
large-scale quantum computer

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
so we would need to completely replace

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,360
those cryptosystems it would not be

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
enough to simply

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
increase parameters because you'd have

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
to increase them so much it would be

122
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,280
just

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
so inefficient to use them

124
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,800
some of our symmetric key primitives

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
would also be impacted by grover's

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
algorithm or

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
other quantum algorithms

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
but the impact is less dramatic

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
we would need to use longer key sizes

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
use longer outputs from

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
hash functions

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
which is doable we don't have to

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,120
completely replace the algorithm

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
so the focus of our project was geared

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
towards

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,199
the public key side first

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,280
we needed to standardize new algorithms

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,840
to replace the ones that would be broken

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
and this field has come to be known as

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
post quantum cryptography or sometimes

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,759
quantum safe quantum resistant

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,479
cryptography

143
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
and the big question is uh well when do

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
we need to worry about this

145
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
obviously we have to worry about it

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
before quantum computers arrive if we

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
wait till after they arrive

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
it'll be too late

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
um that's the trivial answer

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
the

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
other answer that we always give is well

152
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,919
we need these

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,600
new cryptosystems long before then

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
in every presentation i referred to dr

155
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,639
mosca's theorem here

156
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,080
that helps you understand that

157
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,039
you could be at risk from a

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,120
threat of a quantum computer long before

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
a quantum computer is ever built

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
and the way you imagine that is to just

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
think about the the case where your

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
adversary

163
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
is able to get a hold of your data and

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,479
he copies it and encrypts it or he

165
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,800
copies your encrypted data

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
so the adversary cannot read it yet but

167
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,039
he simply holds on to it

168
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,880
and then

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,639
after a quantum computer comes out they

170
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,880
will get access to your data

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,199
so the only way to prevent that

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,360
is if before a quantum computer comes

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
around

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
we need time to discover new quantum

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
resistant algorithms to standardize them

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,759
get them implemented in products and get

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
them widely adopted

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
so you need all that to happen first so

179
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,199
you can use quantum resistant algorithms

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,560
and then if you're wanting to keep your

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,199
information safe for a number of years

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,960
in this case it's x in this little

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,319
theorem

184
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
you need the number of years to keep

185
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
your information safe

186
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
plus the number of years for

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
standardization and getting things

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,560
adopted

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
to be less than a the time it takes to

190
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
get a quantum computer

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,599
if not then you have a problem

192
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
so from our experience at nist with

193
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
standardization we've seen some past

194
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
crypto transitions

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
and we know that they are never as as

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
quick as we would like them to be

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,759
there are steps you can take to try and

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,680
speed them up a little bit

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
but getting organizations to switch from

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
one crypto algorithm to another

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
it just takes time and it takes time to

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
standardize and evaluate new algorithms

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,919
so that's why it's very important to

204
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
begin this work and get it accomplished

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
well before we have a quantum computer

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
out there

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
what is the status of quantum computers

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
i'm not going to speak much about it

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
you can see that there are headlines

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,280
that give you all sorts of information

211
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
different organizations that

212
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
are building quantum computers trying to

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
make them larger

214
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
have less errors in them

215
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,680
and

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
we try and track their progress

217
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
i also like to turn to uh some other

218
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
experts who have quantified

219
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
the probability that we would have such

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
a computer

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,160
so at the global risk institute dr

222
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
molska and dr piani and some of their

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,440
colleagues

224
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,199
have put out a survey every year where

225
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,599
they've they've asked several experts

226
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
what their opinion is about when would

227
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
we have a quantum computer that would be

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
large enough to break

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,440
rsa 2048 and 24 year hours

230
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
this is their

231
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,879
latest results that they have these were

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
posted just a month or two ago

233
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
and this gives you uh some kind of

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
estimates maybe there's some

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
knowledgeable estimates by some people

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
who

237
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
who seem to know a little bit of course

238
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
nobody knows for certain

239
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
what we can take from this this is a

240
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
chart that kind of summarizes their

241
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
their main findings

242
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
but if you look at that bottom row so

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
what are the odds in five years uh the

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
the experts surveyed put it at pretty

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
low odds most of them were below one

246
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,240
percent

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
five percent

248
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
if you look at the next few rows up if

249
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
you go to 10 years and then 15 years

250
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
you start to see

251
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
more of these people who were surveyed

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
think that there's a higher chance that

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
we could have a big enough quantum

254
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,760
computer to threaten cryptography

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
so maybe all you can take from this is

256
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
that you know it's it's certainly a

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
possibility to have a big enough quantum

258
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,399
computer

259
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,560
in 10 years 15 years 20 years

260
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
we don't really know but there's there's

261
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
a chance that that could happen

262
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
and we need to be prepared with new

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
crypto crypto algorithms

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
uh before that happens

265
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
so at nist uh we've had our project

266
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
going for a number of years um it

267
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,760
started before 2016

268
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
which is the first date on this slide

269
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
but that was the date we kind of began

270
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
some

271
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
bigger actions that were more visible

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
it was in 2016 that we went to pq crypto

273
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
and announced the

274
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,519
the pqc

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
competition-like process

276
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
where we would be soliciting crypto

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
systems from design teams around the

278
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
world

279
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
to find these new algorithms

280
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,320
since then it's been six years and we've

281
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,720
gone through three rounds of evaluation

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
we've held workshops throughout that

283
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,279
process

284
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,519
we've issued reports to explain uh the

285
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
choices we've made at nist

286
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
and where we are currently is the third

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
round is about to end and then we will

288
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
very shortly begin writing

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
the draft standards that we will uh

290
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
put out for comment and publish

291
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
so i'll talk a little bit more in detail

292
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
about some of these events during these

293
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,479
past six years

294
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
back in the beginning

295
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
this was a slide that was on my my first

296
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,399
presentation in

297
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,959
fukuoka about the pqc

298
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,640
process that we would be doing

299
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
we were calling for quantum resistant

300
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
crypto algorithms for new public key

301
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
crypto standards

302
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,600
we wanted two different functionalities

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
because we needed to focus first on the

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,279
basic primitives before trying to do

305
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
anything more advanced

306
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
and we wanted to replace the algorithms

307
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,120
that we had in our nist standards

308
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
so that was again digital signatures

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,560
and

310
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
also encryption or key establishment

311
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,079
we saw our role at nist as managing a

312
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
process of achieving community consensus

313
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
in a transparent and in a timely manner

314
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,200
nist has done a few of these crypto

315
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
competitions over the past few decades

316
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,600
and we think they have worked out pretty

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
well in harnessing the tremendous talent

318
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
that the cryptographic community around

319
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,200
the world has and focusing it on a

320
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
certain problem

321
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
we knew in many ways that this would be

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
different than the past competitions we

323
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
also anticipated that it would be a lot

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
more complicated than the aes and the

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
sha-3 competitions

326
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,839
we're dealing with more primitives uh

327
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,519
post-quantum crypto is a very active

328
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,600
field of research so we knew that there

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
would be results that would be ongoing

330
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
throughout the process

331
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,079
we knew we would be picking more than

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
one algorithm at the end of this not

333
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
just a single one

334
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
some of these algorithms come from a

335
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
variety of different mathematical

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
families and backgrounds

337
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,760
we also have to worry about classical

338
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
computers and quantum computers

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
so we knew that this was going to be a

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,839
very complicated and tricky thing to to

341
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,680
do our hope was that at the end we would

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,839
be able to select some algorithms

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
that most people would agree were good

344
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
choices and would work for the majority

345
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
of applications

346
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
our evaluation criteria

347
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
first we wanted to ensure that the

348
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,399
algorithms selected would be secure

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,320
both against classical attacks and

350
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
against quantum attacks

351
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
for some of the algorithms

352
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
that were submitted some of the best

353
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
known attacks are classical attacks for

354
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
others the best known attacks are

355
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
quantum attacks so we need to provide

356
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
protection against both

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,519
the second criteria

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,760
involved performance which is a pretty

359
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
big criteria because you can measure

360
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
that in a variety of different ways

361
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
you can look at

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,839
benchmarks in software and hardware on

363
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,720
low end platforms

364
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
you can look at what are your key and

365
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
ciphertext sizes what are your your

366
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
signature sizes

367
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
and so all those different ways that you

368
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
can measure performance

369
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
we wanted to to look at and make sure

370
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
that applications and protocols

371
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
would be able to use any algorithms that

372
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,519
were selected

373
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
besides those two main criteria there

374
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
were a number of other properties that

375
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
we were hoping to get

376
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
as much as possible we want these

377
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,720
algorithms to be able to be dropped in

378
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,959
to existing protocols and networks

379
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
without requiring a lot of changes

380
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
we know that might not be possible most

381
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
of these algorithms have larger key

382
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
sizes

383
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
but uh we we think that it should work

384
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
pretty well

385
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,399
we also wanted things like perfect

386
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,959
forward secrecy resistance to side

387
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
channel attacks that's an area that's

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,440
getting a lot more focus

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
and so on and so forth

390
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
in looking at security

391
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
we needed to define some security levels

392
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
or security categories so that we could

393
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
compare the different crypto systems to

394
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,760
each other

395
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
we knew we would get some based on

396
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
lattices some based on codes some based

397
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
on other ideas

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,480
and as kind of a first way to

399
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
to be able to compare them we needed to

400
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
try and measure in a rough way how much

401
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,279
security they were providing when they

402
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,959
gave us a concrete parameter set

403
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,079
there's no consensus is the best way to

404
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
do this back when we were defining these

405
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,199
i still don't think there's probably

406
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,000
consensus even today as the best way to

407
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
measure security um in regards to both

408
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
classical and quantum attacks

409
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
how we define these categories in a way

410
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,959
that leaves open the relative cost of

411
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,279
the various computational resources

412
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
including things like quantum gates

413
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,079
classical gates

414
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,480
quantum memory classical memory hardware

415
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,519
energy

416
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
time etc

417
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
the idea was that in order to meet for

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,240
example say category 1

419
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,079
the best attack

420
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
that would be violating the security

421
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,600
definition for a particular parameter

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
set

423
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
should cost more than a brute force key

424
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
search attack on a single instance of

425
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,959
aes 128

426
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,720
according to any plausible assumption

427
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,240
regarding the relative cost of the

428
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
various computational resources involved

429
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
in a real world attack

430
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
of course there are different opinions

431
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
that can arise this is

432
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
subjective in many ways regarding what

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
constitutes a plausible assumption

434
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
regarding the relative cost of

435
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,199
computational resources

436
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
and nonetheless this was the the best

437
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
definition our team could

438
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
come together with and so that's what we

439
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
used

440
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,600
and

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
it's been a little bit easier i think

442
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,279
submitters tended to focus on levels one

443
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,360
three and five because those were easier

444
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
to provide arguments for

445
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
and if you wanted to argue a little bit

446
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
more about providing more security

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
against quantum attacks you could look

448
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
at levels two and four

449
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
in relation to

450
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
sha-256 and 384

451
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,959
so the

452
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
competition

453
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,639
essentially began in december 7 december

454
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,720
2017 we'd given submitters about a year

455
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
to design their crypto systems

456
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,160
and

457
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
overall we received 82 submissions 69

458
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
met our criteria for acceptance

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
we had almost 300 submitters that were

460
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
part of the design teams for these

461
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
algorithms um they were from all around

462
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
the world that was pretty cool to see

463
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
that

464
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
and the first round lasted about a year

465
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,759
we held a workshop

466
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,839
and all the teams came and presented at

467
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,120
the workshop

468
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
and explained how their algorithms

469
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
worked and their their advantages that

470
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
they saw

471
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
even in the first round we saw a lot of

472
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
cryptanalysis right away

473
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,559
from research that was done there was

474
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
probably around 25 schemes that

475
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,919
were attacked or broken in some way

476
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,400
we set up the pqc forum which is an

477
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
online mailing list where you could

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
discuss research you could ask questions

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,119
we use it for announcements

480
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
and just basically all sorts of topics

481
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
and discussion related to pqc

482
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
standardization

483
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
and at the end of one year we selected

484
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
the 26 algorithms we thought were most

485
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
promising to advance into the second

486
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
round

487
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
there were some hard decisions to be

488
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
made here

489
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
there were some good schemes that didn't

490
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,799
make it because we needed to focus the

491
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
number down to smaller

492
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
in large part our goal was to just keep

493
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
the algorithm algorithmic diversity of

494
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,679
the different types of uh

495
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
cryptosystems that were submitted

496
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
going into the second round

497
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
so in the first round we'd seen a lot of

498
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320
lattice-based and code-based submissions

499
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
and so in the second round again the

500
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
majority of the algorithms were both

501
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,760
lattice-based and

502
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
or or code-based

503
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,559
of course there were also some

504
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
multivariate signatures we had two

505
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,360
signatures based on symmetric primitives

506
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
and then we had a scheme based on

507
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
esogenies of elliptic curves

508
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,679
during that second round it ended up

509
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
lasting about a year and a half

510
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
similar again

511
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,240
we had a workshop where the teams could

512
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
come and present any updates and we saw

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,559
new research that was done

514
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,039
there was more cryptanalysis done

515
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,480
even though some of these schemes we

516
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
picked to be the more promising ones

517
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
there were several of them that were

518
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
attacked or broken during the second

519
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
round as well

520
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
we started to see more benchmarking as

521
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
well more performance numbers

522
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,679
we started to see some mergers

523
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
there were some schemes that were very

524
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
similar to each other and we encouraged

525
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
those teams to merge

526
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,640
i think in fact two of the

527
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
schemes that are still in round three

528
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,799
are mergers that happened earlier on

529
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
so at the conclusion of the second round

530
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
we focused

531
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
on a smaller number again

532
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
we did something different than we've

533
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
done in the past where we made kind of

534
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
two different categories of algorithms

535
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,720
that would be moving on

536
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,600
uh the first category were finalists

537
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,039
these were the algorithms we thought

538
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
would be ready to be standardized at the

539
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
end of the third round

540
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
and that they would be uh

541
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
general purpose type algorithms that

542
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
could be used for the majority of

543
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,600
applications

544
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,240
we also selected some other algorithms

545
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,400
that we called alternates that we were

546
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
still interested in we still wanted

547
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,559
study to continue on them but we thought

548
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,200
that they might take a little bit longer

549
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
in order for standardization or there

550
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
was a little bit less urgency

551
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
so they could continue being

552
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
studied and evaluated but that they

553
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
might need a fourth round of evaluation

554
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,919
so we we put it this way so that we

555
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
could have attention focused on the

556
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
finalists and get a lot of

557
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,039
dedicated research into them before that

558
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,840
they would potentially be

559
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,440
standardized so we had four chem

560
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
finalists

561
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,440
uh kyber entry saber classic mcleese and

562
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,039
then we had three signature finalists

563
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
dilithium falcon and rainbow

564
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,080
then we had five chem alternates and

565
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
three signature alternates

566
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,480
and again the table shows that we

567
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
maintain the algorithmic diversity

568
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
uh

569
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
going into the third round as well

570
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
we still had lattices codes multivariate

571
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,480
and so on and so forth represented

572
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
so i'll talk a little bit more about

573
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
these schemes that are in the third

574
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,240
round

575
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
i'm not going to get into great detail

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
or technical details about them

577
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
the three finalists kyber entry and

578
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
sabre are all based on what are called

579
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,520
structured lattices

580
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
two of them are a little bit more

581
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
similar kyber and saber are both based

582
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
on module

583
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
learning with errors for kyber and for

584
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
saber learning with rounding

585
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
entry was based on a different problem

586
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,120
that's um it's been around a little bit

587
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
longer since entry was proposed in the

588
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
in the 90s what's called the entrue

589
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
problem

590
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
all three of these algorithms have

591
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,440
pretty good performance i'll show later

592
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
on that they they're

593
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
pretty similar in performance as well

594
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
it's likely any of these three would be

595
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,799
able to be used by most applications and

596
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,039
they do all right

597
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,960
because they are quite similar nist

598
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
expects to select at most one for

599
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
standardization

600
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
there were two other lattice chems that

601
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
were based on

602
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,720
or that were based on lattices uh there

603
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
were alternates we had n true prime

604
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
so entry prime also use structured

605
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
lattices and they had as a design

606
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,039
consideration

607
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
trying to prevent a number of potential

608
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,520
attack surfaces

609
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
so that was part of the way that they

610
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
looked at their their design

611
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,679
and then frodo chem instead of all these

612
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
other schemes using structured lattices

613
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
they made the choice to use unstructured

614
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,840
lattices

615
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
in case there's any potential attack

616
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,480
that would exploit the structure

617
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
frodocam might possibly still be

618
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
unaffected by that so there's a security

619
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
performance trade-off

620
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,400
their performance their key and

621
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,799
ciphertex sizes are a little bit bigger

622
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,240
and their performance is a little bit

623
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,919
slower than these other structured

624
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,320
lattice themes

625
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,400
um

626
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
the other finalist was based on codes

627
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
classic lease it's been around for

628
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
over 40 years it's seen a lot of

629
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
cryptanalysis

630
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
without any uh

631
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
a lot of significant concrete attacks

632
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
that have shaved off any bits of

633
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
security

634
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
it has an interesting performance

635
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,520
profile very large public keys

636
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
um i think they're

637
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
they might be the the largest out of the

638
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,720
chems they're in the third round

639
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
but they have the very smallest cipher

640
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,679
texts so for some applications that

641
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,960
might be a

642
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
potentially useful thing if you can find

643
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
a way to work around the large public

644
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,639
keys

645
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,200
we had two other chems that were

646
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,799
alternates that were based on codes as

647
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
well

648
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
the design teams introduce some

649
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
algebraic structure into the codes in

650
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
order to try and reduce the key sizes

651
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,120
down

652
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,440
and so they do both have much smaller

653
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,240
key sizes than classic mclease in terms

654
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
of the public keys they're both pretty

655
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,039
efficient they're not quite as efficient

656
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
as the structured lattice space

657
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
finalists but they're not too far behind

658
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
either

659
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
and nist is interested in them as good

660
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,840
general purpose

661
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
algorithms that would complement our

662
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
chem portfolio

663
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,520
so we

664
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,559
want to

665
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,679
continue research on them as well

666
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,159
the final alternate chem styke is based

667
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,720
on isogens of elliptic curves

668
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
that's a little bit newer idea um it's

669
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
been probably only in the last decade

670
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
that there's been more attention focused

671
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
on the cryptographic applications of

672
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,080
isogenes where we're starting to see a

673
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,200
lot of research being put into that

674
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,039
psych has a

675
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
performance profile that has very small

676
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
public keys very small cipher text

677
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,400
but as a disadvantage it is slower in

678
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,559
implementations by almost an order of

679
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,559
magnitude in comparison to most of its

680
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
uh competitors

681
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
so we still have a variety of different

682
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,720
mathematical

683
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
problems and security assumptions which

684
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,120
these chems are all based on

685
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
if we look at the signatures there's a

686
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
smaller number of them

687
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,679
we selected dilithium and falcon both

688
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,520
were finalists both are based on

689
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
structured lattices

690
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,880
um

691
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,279
lithium and falcon

692
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,320
again

693
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
they're similar but they have some

694
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
differences i'll go into them uh later

695
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
on both have very good all-around

696
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
performance

697
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,400
and so nist is looking at them to see

698
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,760
which would make good algorithms um

699
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,039
to be selected for standardization

700
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
there was also two alternate signatures

701
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
that were based on symmetric primitives

702
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
so picnic is based on a zero knowledge

703
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,000
proof and a block cipher low mc

704
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
it has a very interesting design that

705
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,039
was kind of different than anything else

706
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
in the in the process

707
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
its design has also evolved probably

708
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,360
more than any other algorithm over the

709
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,720
three rounds

710
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
as there's been a lot of research into

711
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
kind of

712
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,880
how picnic could be improved and improve

713
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
its efficiency in particular

714
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
sphinx plus of course is based on a

715
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
security of hash functions it's a

716
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,080
stateless scheme

717
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,240
security is very well understood it's

718
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
been a

719
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,480
we'd say it's a mature scheme and is

720
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,840
been pretty stable throughout the

721
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,919
process

722
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
it's a little bit bigger and not quite

723
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
as efficient as the lattice based themes

724
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,880
um picnic is the same has kind of

725
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,480
similar performance characteristics

726
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,679
and then finally we have the two

727
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,600
multivariate-based schemes um the

728
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,440
finalists rainbow which we thought was a

729
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
little bit better than the alternate

730
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
gems

731
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
they both have very large public keys

732
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
very small signature sizes

733
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
and then talking about rainbow and gems

734
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
early on in the third round

735
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,000
there were some crypt analytic results

736
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
that led to attacks on both rainbow and

737
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
gems

738
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,720
and

739
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
the designers you know responded to

740
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
those in rainbow's case they said well

741
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
if you look at the amount of memory

742
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
that's required

743
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,880
you know that might come into play

744
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,120
so it raised some doubts about having

745
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,919
confidence in either of their security

746
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,600
of course very recently in the past few

747
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,520
weeks we've seen uh

748
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
ward bullions posted a new attack on

749
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,200
rainbow

750
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,000
that

751
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
breaks the category one parameters as

752
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
titled in the paper uh in a weekend on a

753
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,320
laptop

754
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
and that's got a

755
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
lot of attention because i think people

756
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
know we're close to the end of the third

757
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
round and so seeing a finalist get

758
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,799
broken

759
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,679
um

760
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,440
catches their attention

761
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,039
of course during all three rounds we

762
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,840
have seen algorithms

763
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,760
um get attacked or broken

764
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,679
and that's because uh we have a lot of

765
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,240
dedicated research going on and that's

766
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
what we expect to see throughout the

767
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
process

768
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
i'm rainbow had shown some earlier signs

769
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,240
of being um

770
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
potentially having some attacks where

771
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,279
earlier on in the third round there had

772
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,799
been some attacks

773
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,960
so this wasn't completely unexpected and

774
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
out of blue and out of the blue but it

775
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
was still a nice result

776
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
to see this come out

777
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,600
and i think it serves as a reminder that

778
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
until an algorithm has been completely

779
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,399
evaluated and selected and standardized

780
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,840
you want to be careful not to put it

781
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,678
into products until the standard is done

782
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,399
as a result of some of this

783
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
these attacks on these signatures

784
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,960
we only had six signatures in the third

785
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,080
round

786
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
and both gems and rainbow had suffered

787
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
attacks

788
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,120
about a year ago we asked for feedback

789
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
on two things that nist might do to

790
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,240
address

791
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
some of these issues

792
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
the first thing we put forward is that

793
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,480
we would consider or we wanted feedback

794
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
on the idea of standardizing sphinx plus

795
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,520
after the third round even though it was

796
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,960
an alternate and not a finalist

797
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
in our report we mentioned it was a very

798
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,039
conservative scheme it had been stable

799
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,960
and was was ready for standardization

800
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,039
we also discussed the idea of

801
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,240
introducing

802
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
a new mechanism that nist would start a

803
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
process to consider new signature

804
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,679
schemes

805
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,039
after our current process was over

806
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,720
so we asked for feedback on both of

807
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
those and i would say we got positive

808
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
feedback

809
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,559
if nist wanted to take actions on both

810
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,918
of those different things

811
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
so the past few months nist has been our

812
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,159
team has been meeting

813
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
very frequently a couple of times a week

814
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,559
to evaluate which of the schemes we

815
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,840
would select

816
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
as we were nearing the end of the third

817
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
round

818
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,799
we have dedicated presentations on each

819
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,720
and every candidate

820
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
looking at the evaluation criteria

821
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,399
specifically

822
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,559
looking at the security looking at the

823
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
different uh parameter sets that they

824
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,559
had their security proofs the best known

825
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
classical and quantum attacks

826
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
we looked at all the performance numbers

827
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,919
that we could we could find

828
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,760
it's easier to measure their the size of

829
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
the parameters the p sizes and so on but

830
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,720
we were also looking at efficiency of

831
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,840
key gen

832
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,720
encryption decryption signing verifying

833
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
both in software and hardware on on many

834
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
different platforms how much memory they

835
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,159
used that kind of thing

836
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,840
and then we looked at particular

837
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,039
algorithm and implementation

838
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,039
characteristics you know were there ip

839
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,799
issues do they have decryption failures

840
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,559
has there been side channel work done on

841
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,679
them

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,840
how good is the documentation that the

843
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,399
team turned in

844
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
what papers were published in dealing

845
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,399
with them what was the discussion on the

846
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,440
pqc forum about them

847
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
and so we've had a lot of

848
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,760
good uh discussion

849
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,080
um as well as on the pqc forum we've

850
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
seen there have been a lot of external

851
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
discussion as well

852
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
we also had various presentations

853
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,880
comparing some of these algorithms

854
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
against each other each other so we

855
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
could make uh some of these tough

856
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,840
decisions that we'd have to make

857
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,279
for lattice chems our main decision that

858
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,880
we're focusing on

859
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,440
was selecting between kyber and true and

860
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
saber

861
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
as i said they're they're quite similar

862
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,480
and we expected to

863
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,799
only need one of them

864
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,600
to

865
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,240
be our primary go-to algorithm

866
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,120
that would work for most applications

867
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
similarly for lattice signatures

868
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,360
our main decision that we were focused

869
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,760
on was looking at dilithium and falcon

870
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
for all of the other algorithms

871
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,080
when we were deciding

872
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,159
it kind of came down that each one was

873
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
kind of its own competitor

874
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
and we were looking to see would it

875
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
advance or would it be selected for

876
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
standardization

877
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,799
based on its own merits um so there was

878
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,799
a lot of kind of individual decisions

879
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,640
there of course they're in somewhat in

880
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,840
competition with each other in various

881
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,120
ways but the particular algorithm

882
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
the decisions were a little bit

883
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,559
different than those two main decisions

884
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,760
that i talked about up there

885
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
so giving a little bit more info on

886
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,519
kyber and true and saber

887
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
again this isn't super detailed but just

888
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,640
a little bit more

889
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
as i said kyber and sabre are based on

890
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,919
similar

891
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,799
security assumptions both are based on

892
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,720
module learning with errors

893
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,360
in saber's case learning with grounding

894
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,120
while entry was based on a different

895
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,559
problem

896
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,640
all three were constructed from public

897
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
key encryption schemes and then using

898
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,519
some type of fujisak akamoto transform

899
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,320
to convert it into a chem and then they

900
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
were able to have

901
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,760
security proofs

902
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,559
dealing with industry

903
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,279
indistinguishability against chosen

904
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,600
ciphertext attacks

905
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
kyber and sabre both had decryption

906
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
failures and true does not

907
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,559
um there's different choices that these

908
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,960
algorithms made in their design

909
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,519
so kyber and sabre use modules with a

910
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,159
cycloatomic ring that's a power of two

911
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
whereas entro uses a sickle atomic ring

912
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
with a prime power

913
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,559
there are other further differences of

914
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,679
course when you dig into the

915
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,360
specifications

916
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
but you can see that there's a lot of

917
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
similarities as well as some differences

918
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,679
i put two charts up here just to give

919
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,159
you some idea about the performance

920
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,799
again these are not intended to be

921
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,640
you know we made our decision based only

922
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,159
on these two charts kind of thing but

923
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,919
just to kind of show you how do they

924
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
compare relative to each other

925
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,279
on the left the chart shows

926
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
the bandwidth the public key size plus

927
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,080
the ciphertext size

928
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
and it's grouped into category one

929
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,559
category three and category five

930
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,799
you can see a category one they're all

931
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
pretty close together uh similarly for

932
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,640
category three

933
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
i mean category five entries key sizes

934
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,919
look to be a little bit higher but they

935
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,360
they're

936
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,640
still relatively comparable

937
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,480
on the right i put a chart that looks at

938
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
their performance in software on an

939
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
avx-2 processor

940
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,919
and this takes into account their

941
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,559
bandwidth as well as their efficiency in

942
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,240
terms of cycle counts for key gen

943
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,640
encapsulation and decapsulation

944
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
since performance

945
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,159
in the real world would probably take

946
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
both metrics into account

947
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,360
um again you see all three if you were

948
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,720
to look at the numbers they're very

949
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
comparable and would would probably do

950
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
quite well compared to current crypto

951
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,840
algorithms that we use today

952
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
and saber tend to be a little bit more

953
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
efficient based in this graph than and

954
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,159
true

955
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,000
but again all three would probably work

956
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,919
just fine for most applications

957
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,799
if we look at a similar type of chart

958
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,360
for dilithium and falcon

959
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
again they're both lattice-based but

960
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,040
there are some different design

961
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,079
differences

962
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,719
dilithium is based more on module lwe

963
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,960
while falcon was based on module sis

964
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
over entry type lattices

965
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,119
that lithium uses the idea of fiat

966
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,719
shimmer with the boards

967
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,760
it uses the simpler uniform sampling

968
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
falcon's a little bit more complicated

969
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,839
it uses hash than sine with a gaussian

970
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,440
sampling algorithm that it's a little

971
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,520
bit more delicate

972
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,760
in particular their key gen and just

973
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,239
overall implementation

974
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
is more complex

975
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,159
and uh

976
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,239
potentially in some you know low

977
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,239
resource environment

978
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,159
a falcon uses floating point arithmetic

979
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
with high precision and some complicated

980
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,839
data structures

981
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,440
and that might be a challenge in some

982
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
cases

983
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
on the other hand we'll see that falcon

984
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
has some performance advantages down

985
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,920
below

986
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
they both use rings of the same type

987
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,920
against stick atomic extensions or with

988
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,599
powers of two

989
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
they both had security proofs against uh

990
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,520
existential unforgiability

991
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,880
and comparing them you can see uh falcon

992
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
on the left our our chart that measures

993
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,760
the public key plus the signature size

994
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
falcon is noticeably smaller than

995
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,240
dilithium it's it's got just a lot

996
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
smaller

997
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,079
key sizes and signature sizes

998
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,000
on the right if we include

999
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,760
the performance

1000
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,599
on again a software and avx2 machine

1001
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,079
largely because of the

1002
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,359
bandwidth

1003
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,640
you know falcon again comes out ahead so

1004
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,599
there are some trade-offs to each one

1005
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
as we had to consider our decision we

1006
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,119
had to carefully consider those

1007
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
and then a factor which

1008
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
has played a part in a lot of our

1009
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,520
discussion both internally and we've

1010
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
seen on the pqc form as well is the

1011
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,320
issue of patents and ipr

1012
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
um this played a larger role than i ever

1013
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
anticipated when we began the process

1014
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
um at the beginning we we had this

1015
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
ip statements that each team had to

1016
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,119
submit in where their submission team

1017
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,640
let us know of any patents that they

1018
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000
held or that they were aware of

1019
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,599
our call for proposal said we didn't

1020
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,599
object in principle to algorithms that

1021
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,200
have patents where technical reasons

1022
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,040
justify the approach

1023
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
but nist would strongly consider any

1024
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,880
factors which would hinder adoption in

1025
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
our evaluation process

1026
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,960
we know that when there are ipr issues

1027
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,800
people are less likely to adopt those

1028
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,160
algorithms

1029
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,079
and one of our goals is to get these

1030
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,720
post-quantum algorithms widely adopted

1031
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
to help protect against uh you know

1032
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
future attacks from quantum computers

1033
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,320
so this was a

1034
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,880
obviously a big consideration

1035
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,800
it's also very complicated area i'm not

1036
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,960
a lawyer no one on my you know our pqc

1037
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
team at nist is a lawyer

1038
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,240
um

1039
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,520
and

1040
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,640
is

1041
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,839
something we've had to learn a little

1042
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,599
bit about we've counseled with our

1043
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
artist lawyers that we have who have

1044
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,640
helped us on this but they are not

1045
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
crypto experts so we have we've had to

1046
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
kind of work together

1047
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,960
we are actively engaging to try and

1048
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,839
resolve known ipr issues of course there

1049
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,599
were some we knew about it initially

1050
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
because the submitters had patents on

1051
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,880
their own algorithms

1052
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
we also became aware of third-party

1053
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,520
patents where outside

1054
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,079
parties and organizations held patents

1055
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
that were potentially relevant to some

1056
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,680
of the algorithms that we were

1057
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,839
considering standardizing

1058
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,839
so we've been in talks with these

1059
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,480
parties to try and resolve them

1060
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,400
happy to say we've had some

1061
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
positive steps in the right direction

1062
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
i'd say

1063
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,680
i don't have any concrete details that i

1064
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,480
can give out at that at this point yet

1065
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,599
but um

1066
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,520
i'm happier than i was several months

1067
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,240
ago that we've been able to

1068
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,599
get things going in the right direction

1069
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,200
it may not be possible for nist to

1070
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
resolve all ip concerns because we can't

1071
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,640
control you know what what other parties

1072
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,160
do

1073
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,359
so this was

1074
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
something during the third round that

1075
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
was definitely a large factor

1076
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,280
and we're very much committed to getting

1077
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
a algorithm that will be able to be

1078
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,520
widely adopted

1079
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,680
so

1080
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
okay so that is kind of

1081
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,480
what has gone on the past six years um

1082
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
let me talk about the timeline in the

1083
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
future from here now

1084
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
the third round will end literally any

1085
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,599
day now

1086
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,200
we have made our decisions we have

1087
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,440
written our report

1088
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
it is undergoing the kind of the process

1089
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,960
that we have to go through at nist to

1090
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
get it reviewed and approved by various

1091
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
people before we can publish it

1092
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,359
my guess is it will still take a couple

1093
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,440
of weeks i'm hopeful that by the end of

1094
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,320
the month

1095
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,240
we will be able to announce

1096
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,040
which algorithms we will standardize

1097
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,280
what will that announcement include

1098
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
it'll include the finalist algorithms

1099
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
that we would like to standardize

1100
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,599
uh it would also potentially include the

1101
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
alternate sphinx plus even though it's

1102
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,160
not a finalist we have said that it's an

1103
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,680
algorithm that we

1104
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,880
could potentially select for

1105
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
standardization at the end of the third

1106
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
round

1107
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,119
and

1108
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,480
um

1109
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
we'll of course have our report to go

1110
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,520
along with it

1111
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
a report we've worked harder to make it

1112
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,800
a little bit more substantial than our

1113
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,599
last report so that's taken more work

1114
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,760
our announcement will also include the

1115
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
candidates that are advancing to a

1116
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,240
fourth round for evaluation

1117
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,000
that fourth round will

1118
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,560
be similar to our previous three rounds

1119
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
it'll probably end up being a little bit

1120
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,839
longer because we'll be doing um

1121
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,359
we'll be drafting the standards at the

1122
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,599
same time and so we'll our attention

1123
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,920
will need to be um

1124
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,000
working on that as well

1125
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,680
uh the algorithms in the fourth round

1126
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,520
will be to help us diversify our

1127
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,200
portfolio from the algorithms that we

1128
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,599
will select for standardization

1129
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,200
it's likely we'll hold a workshop

1130
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,800
sometime in the fall or the winter of

1131
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,359
this year we haven't completely

1132
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,920
got the details on that

1133
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,680
and our goal is to release draft

1134
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
standards for public comment later on

1135
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,560
this year or early on in 2023

1136
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,960
we want to get these quickly done

1137
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,720
we'll put them out for public comment

1138
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
we'd encourage everyone to take a look

1139
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,280
at them

1140
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,240
give us comments provide us suggestions

1141
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,319
we'll then revise those in and fix

1142
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,400
anything that needs to be fixed

1143
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,720
and our goal is to have the final

1144
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,640
standard published by 2024

1145
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,440
so what does standardization mean uh

1146
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
our current algorithms are standardized

1147
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,359
in a couple of different documents

1148
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,119
in a fips which stands for federal

1149
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,280
information processing standard and some

1150
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,480
sps which stand for special publication

1151
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
so we will write documents that

1152
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,960
completely specify how to implement

1153
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,520
and instantiate you know the algorithms

1154
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,160
selected for standardization

1155
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,480
in doing so we will work with the the

1156
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,160
candidate teams

1157
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
to help make sure we've understood it

1158
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,160
correctly and any details that need to

1159
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
be included in the standard which might

1160
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,599
not have been in the

1161
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,359
specification

1162
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,280
we'll need to select specific parameter

1163
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
sets to include and

1164
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,079
and give a uh you know describe what

1165
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,280
security strength they are providing

1166
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,880
if we need to seek feedback from the

1167
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,119
community on any of these topics we will

1168
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,599
of course do so probably through the pqc

1169
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,200
forum

1170
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,440
and then as i said we'll write those

1171
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,720
documents and we'll put them out for

1172
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
public comment as we always do with our

1173
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,240
nest documents

1174
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,720
we'll make whatever

1175
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
revisions that we need to based on the

1176
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
feedback and then publish them for you

1177
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
so people begin can begin implementing

1178
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,839
them and putting them into their

1179
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,040
products

1180
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
we'd again encourage everyone that we

1181
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,839
want to

1182
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,520
not put them into products until the

1183
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
standard is completely done

1184
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
there could be small changes from the

1185
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
specification to the final standard

1186
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,119
there won't be any major changes but

1187
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,640
small things might need to be tweaked

1188
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,040
i mentioned that we'd also have a

1189
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,119
process for new signatures because we

1190
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,720
have a just a smaller number of

1191
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,119
signatures in the third round

1192
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,400
so nist

1193
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,079
we will also issue a new call for

1194
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,920
signatures

1195
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,760
shortly after we make our announcement

1196
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,119
we wanted to get our announcement done

1197
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,800
before writing the call for signatures

1198
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,800
but we will be asking for

1199
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,880
you know signatures like we we did

1200
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,040
before um the deadline for submission

1201
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,119
will probably be sometime around january

1202
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,560
2023

1203
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
so that people have plenty of time to

1204
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,200
design these uh signature schemes

1205
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
this process will be a lot smaller in

1206
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,960
scope than what we've done the past six

1207
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,400
years

1208
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,480
we're not looking to recreate everything

1209
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,520
again

1210
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,680
our main goal is we want to diversify

1211
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,920
our signature portfolio

1212
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,319
we're quite happy with having a good

1213
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,240
structured lattice-based digital

1214
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,760
signature

1215
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,200
um but what we want to do is have

1216
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,800
another general purpose digital

1217
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
signature that is not based on lattices

1218
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,800
so we want to get another candidate or

1219
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,400
candidates that will fulfill that need

1220
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,920
there could be other things that we are

1221
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
interested in for example a signature

1222
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
scheme with very short signatures would

1223
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,960
very likely be of interest to us

1224
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
so we'd encourage if you have questions

1225
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
about that contact us and we can help

1226
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,520
you know if

1227
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
we're interested in you know in your

1228
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,280
idea or feel free to just submit it

1229
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,800
anyway

1230
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,720
these signatures will be on a different

1231
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,240
track a different progress than the

1232
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,319
candidates in the fourth round the

1233
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,760
fourth round will be going as soon as

1234
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,839
the third round ends um

1235
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
this uh

1236
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,359
on ramp as we often call it won't begin

1237
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,920
until probably almost a year after the

1238
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,599
third round ends

1239
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,920
and these algorithms you know they they

1240
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,280
were just beginning the process they

1241
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,720
will have to go through a number of

1242
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,599
years of evaluation before

1243
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,760
they could potentially be standardized

1244
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
so obviously the more the mature the

1245
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,160
scheme is submitted the better but we

1246
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,079
will still need to carefully analyze

1247
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,440
these algorithms

1248
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,359
and so they'll be on kind of a parallel

1249
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,240
track

1250
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,520
from our current process

1251
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,520
there are many important research

1252
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,560
challenges

1253
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,000
there's been a lot of work in these

1254
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,599
areas during our three rounds of

1255
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,680
evaluation and a lot during the third

1256
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,599
round in particular

1257
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,079
but i would say these uh these issues

1258
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,440
are also not

1259
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
settled yet there's a lot of work that

1260
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,359
could be done internally in this we're

1261
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,119
working on this and we hope to encourage

1262
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,520
people to look at a variety of different

1263
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,000
topics as well

1264
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,680
i don't think i'll go through and talk

1265
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,319
about any of these in detail but

1266
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,800
they very much matter and we want to

1267
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,960
still get the answers to some of these

1268
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,839
questions

1269
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,839
a nist is one of many standards

1270
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,000
organizations we're aware of other

1271
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,599
standards organizations and we've been

1272
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,359
communicating and collaborating with

1273
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,319
them

1274
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,240
it's been good to see we've been pretty

1275
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
united at focusing our attention

1276
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,319
in it mostly in this process so that we

1277
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,520
could have

1278
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,359
all the cryptographers participating in

1279
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,480
it

1280
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,079
but there are other organizations like

1281
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,640
ieee p-1363 they had some of the

1282
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,000
earliest lattice-based schemes

1283
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,359
standardized

1284
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,359
the ietf has standardized some stateful

1285
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,839
hash based signatures uh nist then later

1286
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,720
also standardized lms and xmss

1287
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
we've also given some other uh

1288
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,839
doing some other work in post quantum

1289
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,119
cryptography etsy has released various

1290
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
quantum save crypto reports that have

1291
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,520
been very useful for organizations

1292
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,880
there's expert groups that have made

1293
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,319
recommendations for particular

1294
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,760
algorithms

1295
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,920
iso has done a study period on quantum

1296
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,520
resistant crypto

1297
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,040
and we've also been in contact with

1298
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,400
other countries that have been working

1299
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,839
on standardization

1300
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,119
activities

1301
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:51,920
and

1302
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
so we're grateful for this we hope this

1303
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,160
continues

1304
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,640
in conclusion um

1305
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,400
i'd say the beginning of the end of our

1306
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,160
pqc

1307
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,560
process is is here you know we're at the

1308
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
end of the third round where we are

1309
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,160
seeing some of the light at the end of

1310
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,520
the tunnel and we will select some

1311
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,599
algorithms for standardization

1312
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,280
it's not the complete end as i've

1313
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
described this work will continue we

1314
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,960
have the fourth round of evaluation that

1315
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,319
will continue

1316
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,240
and we'll have more digital signature

1317
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,760
schemes that we'll be looking at in the

1318
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
future

1319
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,599
so we hope you continue to participate

1320
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,839
we are grateful for everybody's efforts

1321
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,920
we certainly cannot do this without all

1322
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,720
the work that all of you have done

1323
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,359
both in industry and academia

1324
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,680
i'm doing performance benchmarking

1325
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
security analysis real world experiments

1326
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,680
um it's truly a

1327
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,880
good to see

1328
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
that we're all working together on this

1329
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,560
so of course for more information you

1330
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,240
can see our web page and i'd encourage

1331
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,079
you to sign up for the pqc forum if you

1332
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,040
haven't

1333
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,560
that's where most of our announcements

1334
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,720
in the discussion relevant to this is

1335
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,000
going on

1336
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,839
so again thanks again for the invitation

1337
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,520
to talk and i'd be happy to answer any

1338
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,319
questions as well

1339
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,400
oh let's not go let's talk i'll speak

1340
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,720
okay uh so

1341
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,880
please raise your hand if you have any

1342
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,200
question

1343
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,880
is there any question from audience

1344
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
uh questions

1345
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,800
when you announce the the the winners

1346
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,720
will they're also announcing which

1347
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,960
parameter sets or will be tweaking some

1348
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
parameter sets to be more conservative

1349
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,599
than what we're in submissions or will

1350
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,800
that be uh any such things be

1351
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,880
pushed off to later in the review

1352
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,000
process

1353
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,319
yeah with our announcement i don't we

1354
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,880
are not picking the the parameter sets

1355
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,920
yet so that'll be part of the

1356
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,480
the the work after to select which

1357
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,520
parameter sets would be standardized

1358
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,720
um i think our intention is to not have

1359
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,480
a lot of tinkering we want the

1360
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,079
evaluation that's gone on during the

1361
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,000
three rounds to matter

1362
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
but if there needs to be new parameter

1363
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,359
sets that's something that we might be

1364
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
open to we'd probably discuss that with

1365
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,720
the community

1366
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,480
but no we won't be announcing specific

1367
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,520
parameter sets with the announcement

1368
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,839
so easy okay

1369
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,200
okay then press tab

1370
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,119
my question's really about quantum

1371
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,880
analysis i feel like there's been a lot

1372
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,359
of classical a lot of effort by by

1373
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,280
researchers from the crypto community on

1374
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,960
in terms of classical

1375
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,640
cryptanalysis

1376
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,920
i haven't

1377
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,440
got much of a sense that there's been a

1378
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
lot of input from people outside the

1379
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,359
existing crypto community so people from

1380
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,880
quantum algorithms

1381
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,839
um and even even the the five security

1382
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,720
levels

1383
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,319
i still don't know if if i really

1384
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,160
understand what it means what's a

1385
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,920
quantum attack on aes for example so do

1386
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,040
you feel like there's really been enough

1387
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,280
scrutiny from outside our community into

1388
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,760
the quantum hardness

1389
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,000
we would of course like to see more um

1390
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,160
that's it's a good point you raised that

1391
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
it's hard to bridge the gap between

1392
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
different communities of interest

1393
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,240
we try to include more people that are

1394
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
experts in quantum algorithms we have a

1395
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
few people on our team that are

1396
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,240
are in that field and

1397
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,119
um

1398
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,800
from our perspective there's been enough

1399
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
that we can select some algorithms for

1400
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,720
standardization we would love to have

1401
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,440
more research and learn more

1402
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,359
but um

1403
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,960
yeah that's that's going to be a

1404
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
challenge it has been and will probably

1405
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,520
continue to be

1406
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,520
so is it okay then

1407
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,839
professor bernstein please

1408
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,359
it's actually the other part of it tanya

1409
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,680
lange

1410
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,160
that's when you mentioned in the

1411
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,680
comparison of the lattice finalist scams

1412
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,040
the speed comparison and the size of the

1413
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,880
public key comparison but you didn't

1414
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,000
comment on security comparisons

1415
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,680
um could you say something about them

1416
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,920
sure yeah so they're based on different

1417
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,480
problems and in their specification um

1418
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,720
documents each of the teams presented

1419
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,000
arguments and made claims about the

1420
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
the precise amounts of security that

1421
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,440
they were given

1422
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,880
um

1423
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,079
nist is

1424
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,400
happy with the the security discussion

1425
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
of all three teams and all three could

1426
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,599
be

1427
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,200
selected for standardization we're

1428
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,079
confident enough in their security that

1429
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,079
any of the three could be selected based

1430
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,839
on their security

1431
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,040
um

1432
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
i'm not sure if you're wanting

1433
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,800
more details or if there's a specific

1434
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,520
aspect of that um

1435
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,359
yeah what i'm puzzled about is that

1436
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,000
you're saying now that the uh parameters

1437
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,480
are not going to be specified

1438
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,119
as part of the announcement but you

1439
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
you're saying say andrew has larger

1440
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,280
public keys now they're also aiming for

1441
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,119
more bid security

1442
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,400
and so if the um if the exact security

1443
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,079
is not actually part of the evaluation

1444
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,000
or part of the decision now

1445
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
then i don't quite see how the

1446
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,240
comparison of key sizes would matter or

1447
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,079
the speed comparison so

1448
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,520
what did you fix and what did you

1449
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,240
consider variable in that

1450
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,040
well

1451
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,880
we're not announcing them uh we have

1452
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,920
thought about

1453
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,480
the specific parameter sets that would

1454
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,359
like

1455
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,040
would likely be standardized but we also

1456
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,559
wanted to have discussions with the

1457
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,680
submission teams and what they felt

1458
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,680
um what they would recommend some of

1459
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,359
them included that discussion in their

1460
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,280
in their documents

1461
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,520
but we did we did look at the existing

1462
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,800
parameter sets and the amount of

1463
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,119
security that each parameter set was

1464
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,800
providing and that was factored into our

1465
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,920
decision

1466
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
um

1467
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,880
but on the other hand yeah we also

1468
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,400
were not quite ready to select the

1469
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,559
parameter sets because we wanted to talk

1470
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,240
with the submission teams and perhaps

1471
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,479
with the cryptographic community as well

1472
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,920
so is it okay

1473
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,599
so i got a question like okay

1474
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,520
i had a question that i typed into zulip

1475
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,520
it's rather long

1476
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,000
it's a little bit theoretical but uh

1477
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,280
because the breaks against rsa and

1478
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,800
discrete logs are still a little bit

1479
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,400
theoretical themselves perhaps it's

1480
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,520
appropriate

1481
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
a long time ago i proposed a system

1482
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,000
which would be secure if either

1483
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,079
factoring or discrete logarithms was

1484
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,200
hard

1485
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,920
and that paper was kind of rendered

1486
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,160
obsolete by shore's algorithm which

1487
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,240
attacks both but i was wondering if you

1488
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,559
saw any proposals that tried to base

1489
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,400
their security upon

1490
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,000
two dissimilar

1491
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,319
algorithms or if there was any work on

1492
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,720
universal composability during in any of

1493
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
the proposals

1494
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,440
yeah so that's a good question um if i

1495
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,280
think about the schemes that were

1496
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,680
submitted

1497
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,680
none are coming to mind that that seem

1498
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,839
to be kind of designed with the idea of

1499
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,920
combining two different security

1500
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,520
assumptions

1501
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
maybe there is and someone could correct

1502
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,920
me

1503
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,440
i think some of the discussion in that

1504
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,599
direction has been that

1505
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,440
you could standardize a post quantum

1506
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,079
scheme and combine it in some way in

1507
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,480
some kind of hybrid fashion with another

1508
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,599
scheme

1509
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,839
post quantum more classical

1510
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,839
as a way of you know hedging your

1511
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,680
security and as a way of transitioning

1512
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,440
to these new algorithms

1513
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,920
so in order to break your

1514
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,760
your hybrid mode or whatever you'd have

1515
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,119
to break each of the different

1516
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,280
components

1517
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,800
so we have seen some of that but i'm not

1518
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,440
aware in individual schemes

1519
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,640
that that was addressed too much

1520
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,160
some of the schemes did talk about a

1521
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,280
little bit

1522
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,480
i can think of psych in particular since

1523
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,920
they use a lot of elliptic curve

1524
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,160
cryptography in their implementation

1525
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,359
talked about how there would be a

1526
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,920
natural synergy to combine it with

1527
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,559
an existing elliptic curve algorithm and

1528
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,720
you could reuse some of the

1529
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,640
elliptic curve algorithms

1530
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
and um the two would work well together

1531
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
that way

1532
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,720
um

1533
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,079
and then i forget there was a second

1534
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,400
part of your question i i don't think i

1535
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,319
remembered what that was

1536
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,640
no just whether there was any

1537
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,440
um

1538
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,280
effort to address this question about

1539
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,680
you know we okay so maybe we like

1540
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
lattices this week and we like you know

1541
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,400
short vectors we like uh factoring one

1542
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,280
week

1543
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,040
elliptic curves another week but we

1544
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,559
don't really have any evidence for any

1545
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,319
of these problems being secure so i was

1546
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,000
just sort of wondering why we don't try

1547
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
to if we're really seeking the long-term

1548
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,200
security for something why we don't

1549
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,680
propose something that would compose

1550
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,440
multiple problems which are apparently

1551
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,760
dissimilar

1552
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,680
yeah

1553
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
it's easier to analyze each individual

1554
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,799
component and then try and put them

1555
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,200
together i would think and

1556
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,640
if you're trying to build

1557
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,400
an algorithm design an algorithm that

1558
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,079
would be competing against others for

1559
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,160
this process you probably wanted to not

1560
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,599
make it

1561
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,359
you know you wanted to have it be

1562
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,920
smaller key sizes be more efficient and

1563
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,520
combining more than one algorithm would

1564
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,200
potentially hurt that

1565
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,880
um

1566
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,760
yeah

1567
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,960
yeah

1568
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,839
thanks

1569
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,280
okay

1570
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,240
um

1571
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,119
is there any other question

1572
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,480
oh there was a question about whether

1573
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,240
your slides would be available and i i

1574
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,000
saw there's a powerpoint but if you

1575
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,599
could convert it to pdf i could put it

1576
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,599
on the web sure yeah i can send it to

1577
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,319
you

1578
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,640
okay

1579
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,599
okay here here's my question let's

1580
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,240
speak again

1581
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,839
thank you

1582
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,799
so as a talking about appreciation we

1583
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,480
will be sending uh doctor uh the summary

1584
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,000
uh

1585
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,119
commemorative uh plug and other

1586
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,040
other mementos

1587
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,480
okay and

1588
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,240
let me showed

1589
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,200
uh that block

1590
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,200
so this way we sent to all uh dusting

1591
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,160
the

1592
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,119
doctor dashing movie uh as well as other

1593
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,240
uh

1594
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,200
memorative uh mementos so thank you very

1595
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,079
much

1596
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,640
thank you very much

1597
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,440
okay uh let's have a blank

1598
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,599
and we will start the next

1599
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,119
session

1600
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,760
from
