00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,040
hello everyone i'm tcly

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,160
my paper is liquid resilient ibe with

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
optimal liquid rate from lattices this

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
is a joint work with 400

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,080
considering liquid resilience it means

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
cryptosystems are circled

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
even when

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,720
partial shield key is leaked

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
in practice some circle cryptosystems

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
may be completely broken if a partial

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,920
k

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
is given to the attackers

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,719
two famous examples are side channel

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,079
attacks and could put attacks

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,360
in theory

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
leaky resilience can be used to con

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
construct

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
more complicated systems such as

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
non-valuable code

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
and kdm security

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
more formally the leaked resilience can

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,360
be described by a security game between

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
the challengers and the adversary in the

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,960
following way

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
at the beginning the challenger first

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
send the master public key to the

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,000
adversary and then the adversary can

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,479
conduct key extraction and the key

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
leakage queries in our wtv

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
finally the adversary conducts the

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
challenge query and under the challenger

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,080
answers

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
according to our randomly children beat

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,720
b

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
we see that and adversely win the game

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
if

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
the reversal output

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
a bit b prime

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,399
such that b prime equals b

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
in this paper

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
before in this paper we focus on a

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
simple yet generality model called

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
banked each model

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
in this model we allow the attackers to

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
learn arbitrary information about the

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,920
suit key as key

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
as long as the number of leaked bits

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
is bounded by some parameter l a smaller

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
than

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
secret key size

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
to further characterize this requirement

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,719
there are two important models studied

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
in the literatures

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
that treated the relationship between l

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
and the third key in a different way

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
a relatively quick model and funded

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
retrieval model

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
here we first gave a remark on this

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
literature parameter l and then give a

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
remark on leakage model

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,879
generally

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,599
for the security parameter lambda any

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,480
circuit scheme can resist

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
leakage of l equal

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
a big o

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
log lambda bit

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
so we need to consider how to inline

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,319
arrow such that air

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,080
is larger than

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
a small omega lambda

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
from the view of a concretely absolutely

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
parameter will contribute increase the

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
secure security parameter or the cts

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
certificate size

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
however this will result in bad

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,159
efficiency

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
from that analysis we have the following

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,519
inspirations for the non-trivial liquid

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,640
resilience

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
first we need to use significant

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,519
techniques such as hyper system to

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
construct lipid resilient inclusion

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
schemes

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
second we need to use the liquid error

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
over a single size

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
rather than

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,159
absolute

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,798
value l

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
next we give remarks on two leaked

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,799
models relatively least model and

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,120
boundary retrieval model

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
in the relative liquid model or other

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
size under computation time of the

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,400
crypto scheme will groovy the

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
l

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,720
model

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
error is an independent parameter which

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
grows only with the

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,599
significant size

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
but all other

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,439
size and the computation time view not

102
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
groove with l

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
the result we think boundary retail

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
model should be a much

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
more preferable model but as concrete

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
installations

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,478
we always first try to construct a linux

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,040
release scheme in the relative link

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,839
model and then enhance it into

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,039
bonus travel model

111
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
now we recall the current state of the

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
art first we noticed that for the

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
pre-quantum settings leakage resilience

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,280
can be achieved via the beautiful

115
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,639
framework

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,240
dual system inclusion even for iv av and

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
with optimality rate

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
however current installations of dual

119
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,240
system encryption are all group based

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,479
and thus cannot defend against the

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
quantum algorithms

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
it is an interesting yet extremely

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,199
challenging open problem

124
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,479
uh

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
to instantiate adult encryption from a

126
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
post-quantum candidate such as lw

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
european

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,400
on the other hand

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
imperial works there have been

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,440
constructed

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
lw or lpn based pke schemes with optimal

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,360
rate

133
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
but their ideas

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
cannot be generalized to more advanced

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,199
settings such as ib and abe

136
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
so

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
my question in this paper is that how to

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
achieve the optimal liquid rate

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
for ibe and ib and ab in both relative

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
leaked model and body retrieval models

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
with the security

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
matching existing non-leakage resilient

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,120
ib

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,800
uh and a b and rw

145
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
and the main result of this paper

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
consists of the following four cases the

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
first is abwps with the sizing key

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
and the adapt adaptive security

149
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
the second and the third one

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,639
are

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
lw uh leaked resilient abe

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,720
with optimal leakage rate in the

153
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,319
relative leaked model and the bank

154
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,840
retrieval model

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,638
respectively

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
fourth

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,759
is um

158
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
lwe fourth

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,800
is a

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
liquid brilliant abe with the optimal

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
blocks leakage rate on multiple security

162
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
securities

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
next we introduce the techniques in our

164
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,120
paper

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
in particular we start from weak hyper

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
systems

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
weak hypothesis a weak high school

168
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
system with a in carbohydrate

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
encapsulated case his base k

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
consists of four algorithms the first

171
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,919
one is the central algorithm which

172
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
outputs up here of pks k the second one

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,000
is the valid income solution algorithm

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
which outputs a valid server test the

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,479
city and its inc absolute key k in k

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,599

177
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280

178
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,880
the third one is the the valid invalid

179
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
income solution algorithm which output

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
and invalid sabotage the city star the

181
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
fourth one is

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
the decal solution algorithms which

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,080
outputs an

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
income solution

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
key prime

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
formally

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,960
wgps should satisfy the following three

188
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
properties the first one is quranis it

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
specifies that

190
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
the encapsulated key k from the

191
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,960
validating consolation algorithm should

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
be equivalent to that of

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
the decor solution algorithm

194
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
the third one is the assemblative and

195
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
distinct variability it's specified that

196
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,560
even given the secret key

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
the adversary still cannot distinguish

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,000
the valid subtest from the corresponding

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
invalid one

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
the third one is the information

201
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,199
theoretical properties

202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,479
in particular we use l

203
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
w universal to denote that

204
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
the length of the

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
inconsolated key

206
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
k prime at the same time given the

207
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
public key and

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159
the invalid sabotage the ct star the

209
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
remaining entropy of k prime is still

210
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
larger than

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
w

212
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
given a weak hybrid system under

213
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,519
extractor there is a generic

214
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,360
construction of a liquid resilience

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
scheme

216
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,360
in the relative leaked model as follows

217
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,399
particularly for the inclusion algorithm

218
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,720
we first run the valid incorrect

219
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
solution algorithm to get valid several

220
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
times the c and the income solution p k

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,839
and then use the output of the random

222
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
external to hide the message m

223
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,200
v r

224
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
is are randomly chosen

225
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
by the encryption algorithm

226
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
notice all that this general

227
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,519
construction can be directly generalized

228
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
to ib and abb

229
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,760
settings for the security proof of the

230
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
above generic construction we need to

231
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
first replace the valid and

232
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
include income solution in the server

233
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
test with the invalid one and then

234
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
generate the encapsulated key through

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,120
using

236
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
the decal solution algorithm at least to

237
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
obtain p prime

238
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
and thus the server test is of this form

239
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
clearly we know that the leakage on silk

240
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
key will derive the entropy loss on

241
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
k-prime but here

242
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,720
the used extractor can conquer

243
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
that lows

244
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
and we get a simple construction

245
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
that literally is smaller than this

246
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
ratio uh

247
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
entropy of k prime over

248
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,839
size of secret

249
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,160
key based on this conclusion it is clear

250
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,320
that we can enlarge

251
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
liquid through a two ways first is

252
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,120
enlarge the entropy of k prime third is

253
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,839
a reduced

254
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,600
um the size of a sixth key

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
thus from about the above analysis

256
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
for an abe with

257
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,040
both adaptive security and optimal and

258
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
leaky rate

259
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,839
we need to use

260
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,120
abwps with the

261
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
following two properties

262
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
sizing the key and our device adaptive

263
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,880
security

264
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
however all preview related

265
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,079
constructions charges just satisfy

266
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
succinct key with the selective security

267
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
or adaptive

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
with the non-succinct key

269
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
as a result our next target is to

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
consider how to achieve the required

271
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
abwps

272
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
in order to describe autonomic more

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
clearly let us first recall the existing

274
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
result

275
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
particularly taking ibe as example given

276
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
any ibe there is a generic

277
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
ib wps as follows

278
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,079
the master public key and

279
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,880
and the master support key of ibps are

280
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
the same as that of

281
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,959
ib ibe

282
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,839
and

283
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,680
uh for

284
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,560
an another day id the valid server test

285
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
of ibtps is an essential

286
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,200
matrix with an error row and m columns

287
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,279
and

288
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
the

289
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,839
encapsulated key is a vector

290
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,399
p similarly the invalid server test is

291
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
also a matrix with the same structure in

292
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
this case the secret key of

293
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
ib gps with respect to id

294
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
consists of four unsafe keys of the

295
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,120
underlying ibe in this case

296
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
the upper bound of the liquid rate is

297
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
this ratio

298
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,200
clearly it is

299
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
if we want to

300
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,519
improve the leakage rate

301
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,800
up bond

302
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
it is necessary to compress the size of

303
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
the sick key

304
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
of the underlying

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,959
ib

306
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:03,960
in the literature

307
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
[Music]

308
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,959
existing paper

309
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,760
uh

310
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
in pkc in

311
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
19 has tried to realize it through using

312
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
the notion of

313
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,079
multi

314
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,880
anonymous identity ibe

315
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
say mibe for short

316
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,480
ibe can generate one substituent key for

317
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,519
many identities simultaneously

318
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
which can be further constructed from

319
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
ipe

320
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
[Music]

321
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
this existing work can only achieve

322
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
constructions in the ibe setting with

323
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,279
just

324
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
selective security

325
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
and the all desired tragedies to achieve

326
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,560
construction in the abe and adaptive

327
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,199
security

328
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,440
so we think

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
how can

330
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
obtain autism constructions

331
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
in order to do this let us first

332
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
generalize the above

333
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,040
mentioned ib wps to abwps in the

334
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
following way particularly we need just

335
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
need to replace ibe with a

336
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
ppab and replace identity with the

337
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,519
attribute

338
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
in this case we can use

339
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
skf as an

340
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,839
skf as i integrated secret secret key

341
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
for uncertainty of the underlying abe

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
uh see clearly assessing the

343
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,839
skf will derive the optimal

344
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,120
rate clearly

345
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
the selective or adaptive security of

346
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,480
the resulting abwps follows directly

347
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,079
from that of the underlying kpi

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
in fact

349
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
due to the spatial form of this form

350
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
this function f

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,720
the underlying ppebe just need to

352
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,079
satisfy

353
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,519
something for nc1 circuit in this case

354
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
rate is outbound by this issue this

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
ratio

356
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,199
besides we also know that the size of

357
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,760
the key assessment property of kpib will

358
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
derive

359
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
the size and properties of a

360
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
w gps

361
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
so

362
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
uh for all these there are a b

363
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,240
and third gps we need to we need to

364
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
use the underlying

365
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
kpep the properties of assassin key and

366
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
adaptive security

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
however our existing av

368
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,079
schemes

369
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,440
satisfy

370
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
servicing the key

371
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,920
not satisfy adaptive

372
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
identity property

373
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
uh particularly those are

374
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
such kind of period works from latin

375
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,079
lattice-based

376
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
and groupist assumptions

377
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
so

378
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,360
the

379
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
next

380
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,959
technical challenge is to

381
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,839
achieve is how to achieve adapt adaptive

382
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
security for

383
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
a av

384
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
gps

385
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,680
here let us observe the valid server

386
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
test of the

387
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
obtained uh avwps again

388
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,440
in the server test matrix each row

389
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
encrypts the same planetary state with

390
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
respect to the rotating attribute

391
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,199
particularly the underlying attribute is

392
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,160
the

393
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
vector x and i

394
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
j

395
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
based on this

396
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
we recall the

397
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
security game of

398
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,880
abh wgps again

399
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,759
when conducting the challenge query for

400
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,680
on attribute x the response and subtest

401
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,439
is essentially included with respect to

402
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,359
x i j and the later part id is chosen by

403
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,439
the challenger

404
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,520
this means that we just need

405
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,559
the adaptive properties over vector x

406
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,439
and

407
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,520
selective properties over i j

408
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,079
based on this we introduce a new notion

409
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,400
of partial adaptive abe

410
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,919
particularly we just need to use abe

411
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
schemes that satisfy adaptive security

412
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
over

413
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,880
uh vertex and the adaptive security and

414
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
the selective security

415
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
over ice

416
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,679
i be

417
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
from all above analysis we can conclude

418
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
that adaptive ibe implies adaptive ibwps

419
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
a directory really abe for t thing 4t

420
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
cnf implies similar abitwps and

421
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,360
selective abe for general circuit

422
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,799
implies similar avws

423
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
after putting all of our analysis

424
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,799
together we can get an abwps with

425
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,679
both

426
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
sides and key and adaptive

427
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
security

428
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,320
which implies abe with optimal lift rate

429
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,918
in the relatively model

430
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
next we need to consider uh how to

431
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,160
generalize the bio construction to the

432
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,480
brm

433
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,960
just as we have mentioned before

434
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
brm can be generalized

435
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
general generally

436
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
out upgraded from

437
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
a relative relative leakage model

438
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
and from all above constructions we know

439
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
that

440
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
relative construction relative rm

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
construction follows generally from the

442
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
combination of abib wps and strong

443
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
structure

444
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,520
then through a parallel reputation and

445
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,600
partial dependence we can upgrade abwps

446
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
and strong structure into amplified abd

447
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,280
ib wps and locally computable structure

448
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,559
basically

449
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,400
and those two

450
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,919
upgrade

451
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,320
building blocks are sufficient for the

452
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,400
constructions in the

453
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
prm

454
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
however due to the usage of locally

455
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,400
computable extractor this general method

456
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
will inherently derive the cost constant

457
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,840
liquid rate in the brm

458
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,559
particularly using the above general

459
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
method

460
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
existing results

461
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,679

464
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
and the pkc paper

465
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
in 19

466
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
can only achieve leakage resilience with

467
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,440
constant rate in the brm

468
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,880
so we need to

469
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
uh we need to ask a question

470
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,159
is it possible to get optimality rate in

471
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,000
the brm

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,520
and we answer for this question is yes

473
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
but we need to improve analysis need

474
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
improved analysis on locally computable

475
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,810

[Music]

477
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
particularly

478
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
we modify local computer strategy into

479
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
local computer structure for larger

480
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,159
alphabets

intuitively for new

482
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,799
variant the entropy source consists of

483
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,159
many blocks

484
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,760
and each bit

485
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,559
of random seed is related to one block

486
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,918
rather than one bit

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,200
we show that the properties of local

488
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
computable is charter for a logic for

489
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
larger alphabet

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,120
through proposing a new analysis for

paper by vadan

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
with a new

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,320
instructor we can get adaptive abe with

495
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,080
optimal liquid rate in the brm

496
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
however

497
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,000
all above constructions in the primo and

498
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
the relative model

499
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
still have one limited

500
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,840
and in other words

501
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
the scheme is circular only against the

502
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,880
leakage attacks on one side key

503
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,080
however

504
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
abe essentially allows many keys to

505
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,200
decrypt one server text

506
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,679
so we need to consider

507
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,240
how to improve it

508
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,400
in order to do this we introduced the

509
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
third monitor of

510
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
this paper bounded occlusion technique

511
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,480
of fe

512
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,360
in a high level we use the synthetic

513
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,919
secretly sharing and the small and

514
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
paralyzed intersection to achieve the

515
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
required boundary collision properties

516
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
till the time

517
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,559
limit

518
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,280
the detailed constant

519
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,000
are deferred to our paper up until now

520
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
we can achieve the adaptive

521
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
uh legitimate abe for several different

522
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,760
policy function classes with any optimal

523
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
leakage rate
