okay hi everyone earlier today I gave a

108
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,140
talk about punctual key wrapping here at

109
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,339
Asia group that some of you might have

110
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,920
seen now clearly this primitive begs to

111
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,560
be accompanied by a rap unfortunately

112
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm not calm but luckily I have a very

113
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,899
talented colleague called Kim who helped

114
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,959
me write a punctual key wrap and also

115
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,359
produce a music video so enjoy

[Music]

117
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
if you want to store all your files on

118
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,899
the cloud and you ask yourself now is

119
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,180
there some a little bit louder

120
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,240
[Music]

121
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,459
he is just jewelry to sample a key that

122
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,620
you use for your fans then take a new

123
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,839
one that you keep for a while the first

124
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,120
one's attack which we will be encrypting

125
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,279
by using the cake and you could keep

126
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,380
wrapping but that's not enough and

127
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,300
that's why I'm happy to show you what

128
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,339
happens you puncture keep flapping just

129
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,560
update your key and then you're all set

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
it leaves you an okay that you can

131
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,650
forget

133
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,680

135
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,899
is a price not forward secure that's not

136
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,000
really nice but here comes our new skin

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,940
to rescue you out the psk's Pancho and

138
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,980

139
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,100

[Music]

143
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,139
hey so when they announced we had to do

144
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,579
abstract video for uh the talks I guess

145
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,800
we were a bit taken aback and we

146
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,860
panicked a bit and ended up with that I

147
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,079
hope it's still a good abstract video

148
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,200
in this short skit I'm going to describe

149
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,600
ludashinsky's signature as well as all

150
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,839
the issues with alcohol during our work

151
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,200
using this Target and a plastic gun

152
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,779
Calvin is a very skilled shooter he

153
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,839
never misses the mark

154
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,220
as he is on the lookout for a new

155
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,440
challenge we'll use him to represent the

156
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,540
signer

157
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,940
we asked Julia who represents the secret

158
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,120
key to hold and randomly move a veil in

159
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,339
front of the target for him

160
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,459
as he doesn't know where the target is

161
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,459
Calvin will randomly shoot darts towards

162
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,060
the Veil

163
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,560
when he eventually manages to hit the

164
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,959
target he goes to mashid's office to

165
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,680
brag about it

166
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,019
the goal being that mashit should not be

167
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,139
able to extract any information on the

168
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,699
state of the veil or the state of Julia

169
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,699

171
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,000

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,240
very impressed by the performance and is

173
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
unable to learn anything else

174
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,880
Calvin likes challenges

175
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,100
and has no thinking about the same

176
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,860
questions we pondered in our work

177
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,019
to make his performance even more

178
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,820
impressive

179
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,540
he would like to shrink the target

180
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,220
however he doesn't want to miss too

181
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,220
often it takes too long to recover dots

182
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,540
on the ground

183
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,820
maybe if it changes the target to

184
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,160
something else for instance

185
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,040
the Target and Veil are square he could

186
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,100
get an even smaller radius what about if

187
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,260
we use gushans

188
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,820
and actually

189
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,279
could he change his weapon for something

190
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,519
else that would be more accurate

191
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,440
find out a formal definition of those

192
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
questions as well as their answers

193
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,300

212
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,880
proofs asymptotically it's Big L just

213
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
the acting this ain't really my thing as

214

is in the category of the best video

317
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,880
abstract and we've decided

318
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,539
democratically to yeah disqualify Khan

319
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,340
because he's clearly a professional so

320
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,659
he shouldn't be

321
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,760
contributing to this anyway so the two

322
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
candidates here are the other two video

323
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,720
abstracts we saw the first one is

324
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,539
punctual key rep and the second one is

325
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,000
on rejection sampling in the wachevsky

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,780
signature scheme so show your hands for

327
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,179
punctual keyword

328
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,960
the first one

329
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,840
yes thanks and for the second one

330
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,900
on rejection sampling

331
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,640
okay I think that was very clear yeah

332
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
first one wins functional key wraps so

333
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
