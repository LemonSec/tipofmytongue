00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,620
hello everyone I'm heart and today I'll

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,180
be talking about the full Quantum

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,340
equivalence of group action discrete log

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,580
in CDH as well as some related results

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,299
this is a joint work with Mark Sandry

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,340
let's start by recalling some basics of

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,619
cryptographic group actions a group

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,039
action is a tuple of a group a set and a

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,980
mapping that satisfies the identity and

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,260
composability properties where the

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,019
composability property is analogous to

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,899
associativity in groups

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,899
to make groups actions cryptographic we

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,460
just endow them with straightforward

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,399
hardness assumptions here we Define the

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,520
discrete log CDH and ddh assumptions

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
over group actions and if you're

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,300
familiar with how these work over groups

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,820
the intuition carries over to group

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,000
actions in a straightforward manner

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,579
the most well-known group action turns

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,699
out to be group exponentiation yes the

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,100
same one used in traditional group based

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,540
discrete log CDH and ddh assumptions

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,479
if we treat the group G as a set and the

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,060
integer exponent as a group then

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,820
exponentiation can just be thought of as

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,380
a standard group action

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,780
more interestingly and more relevant to

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,759
post Quantum cryptography certain

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,220
isogeny based Primitives can be modeled

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,780
as group actions

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,180
for instance SCI fish and its

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,500
derivatives are essentially group

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
actions while Seaside is a bit more

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,360
complicated and it is modeled as

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,220
something called a restricted effective

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,420
group action

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,240
side on the other hand is not a group

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,880
action and the recent attacks on it do

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,560
not seem to affect group action

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,439
modelable isogenies

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,060
so why should we care about group

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
actions currently most of our post

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,799
Quantum crypto systems are based on

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
lattices what if an advance in lattice

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,100
script analysis renders these schemes

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,920
more inefficient like nist suggests in

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
their recent call for Signature schemes

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
we don't want to put all of our post

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,239
Quantum X in one basket

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,760
a billion group action-based crypto

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,459
systems like those from isogenies have

54
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,840
turned out to be some of the most

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,420
promising alternatives to lattice based

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,640
constructions however

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,860
these constructions are very new and

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,720
their security is not as well studied as

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,700
more traditional assumptions

60
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,459
this has led to some surprising and

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,800
unfortunate attacks like the recent work

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,239
breaking side

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,340
so what can we do about this can we

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,319
improve our knowledge of the security of

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,879
these assumptions

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,640
that's what we do in this paper our main

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,280
result is a proof that group action CDH

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,620
and group action discrete log are

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,140
quantum polynomial time equivalent for a

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,760
billion group actions

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,519
since key exchange requires CDH hardness

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
but security analysis is much easier for

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,739
discrete log our result potentially

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,319
greatly simplifies the security analysis

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,019
of group action-based key exchanges and

76
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,660
signatures we also partially solve the

77
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,180
old open problem as stated by Bonet

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,099
Lipton of the equivalence of

79
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,560
diffie-hellman and discrete log although

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,540
we can say nothing about the more famous

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,640
classical case

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,099
so why does this matter this result

83
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,680
gives us more confidence in existing

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,080
group action protocols and allow simpler

85
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,840
security proofs for instance breaking

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,580
certain isogety-based key exchange

87
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,400
protocols would result in a break on

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
essentially the discrete log problem on

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,239
the underlying isogenes which we have

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,040
more confidence is hard

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,680
it also makes building new group action

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,599
based key exchange protocols easier

93
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,459
since you only need to focus on the

94
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,260
discrete log problem for at least

95
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,900
theoretical security we note that this

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,659
result has already been used for new

97
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,940
constructions and finally it's also just

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,299
good to understand group actions better

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,280
but wait there's more

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,280
we show that group action ddh and group

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,000
action CDH are not equivalent we build a

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,060
very basic generic group action model

103
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,280
and we conjecture and offer evidence

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,019
that the dihedral hidden subgroup

105
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,900
problem is equivalent to discrete log in

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,579
this generic model

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,000
finally we show a number of results on

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,759
restricted effective group actions which

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,500
help explain why a reduction doesn't

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,259
work directly for them and offers an

111
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,240
explanation in the form of an

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
interesting connection to lattices

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,160
so thanks for your time and I hope to

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,720
see you all at Asia Crypt
