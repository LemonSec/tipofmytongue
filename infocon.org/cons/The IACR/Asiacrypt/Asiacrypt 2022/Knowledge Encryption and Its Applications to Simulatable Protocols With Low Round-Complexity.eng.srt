1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,460
if you talk I would like to present our

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,500
paper now the encryption and its

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,420
applications to submitable protocols

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,460
with low run complexity and machine

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,160
Zhang is a joinable resident

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,259
first consider the following simple

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,900
protocol roughly the welfare is in the

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,180
publicly to the approval and approval

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,640
will include its WP proving that it

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
knows the specifically or some other

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,260
settlements there's a two examples and

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,480
here we only considered a significant

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,119
approval now as you can see if the

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,279
welfare can't distinguishing subtitles

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,440
then the simulator can easily encrypt

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,820
domain message to conclude the

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,160
simulation and if the weather can't

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,739
distinguishing the subtitles which means

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,600
that the weather should know the suit

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,820
key then we hope that emulator can use

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,940
the secretly as a travel to generate the

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,899
W proof

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,760
from the malicious welfare in other

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,160
words the tablet of stitching machine

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,719
sometimes means the knowledge of the

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
certificate

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,979
then we consider the following two

28
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,780
ingredient scheme closing to our

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,180
requirements that within its encryption

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,700
and the conditional disclosure scheme

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,740
both allow one to change the keypads

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,439
from a MP instance and its weakness

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
so that if the instance is English no

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,259
efficient algorithm can crop subtitles

35
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,360
however neither of them price and

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,820
security using a release instance in

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,979
other words the description algorithm

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,560
provides only a sound proof that the

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,860
corresponding public is valid

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,439
now we have a question can we conduct a

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,420
public key encryption for which only

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,759
algorithms that knows the secret key can

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,880
describe subtitles in other words the

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,460
the department of proof of knowledge of

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,659
the duplicate

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,180
unfortunately most of existing

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,460
encryption schemes fails to the advise

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,619
this requirements without knowledge

49
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,560
assumptions The Only Exception we're

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,420
aware of is a various of robins

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,820
encryption of which security is based on

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,159
the factory assumption

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,860
as shown in 2020 this consumption is

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,020
used for in constructing types of secure

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,959
protocols

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,180
what we did by this question we put

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,800
forward the notion of another encryption

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,500
The Exodus no encryption is associated

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,440
with an empty language the capacitances

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
from the from an instantaneous witness

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,260
the description is related by the

62
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,540
witnessed extractability poverty which

63
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,760
claims that if I efficient that other

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,220
kind distinguishes of text then there

65
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,040
are efficient algorithm extracting the

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,900
weakness which is also part of the

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
duplicate from the adversary

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,340
this is for the whole universe of the

69
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,160
journey to the public key besides it we

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,959
additional require another encryption to

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,239
identify the interesting visual ability

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,019
and the publicly simulation properties

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,180
in our people we pride in the two

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,459
conjunctions of node encryption the

75
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,379
first one is the business and the random

76
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,300
server reducible encryption the

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,819
respective line is based on CDs only

78
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,280
it means that the node encryption can be

79
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,879
conducted from two rankings with secure

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,800
oblivious transfer which is a known

81
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,819
business QR or LW assumption

82
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,340
here we only give a hello idea about the

83
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,959
second conjunction

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,480
remember that the CDs can be conducted

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,940
from the two matches skill function

86
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,159
evaluation for the security stronger

87
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,500
slides the input a simple decoding

88
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,840
mechanism in this circuit

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
so that a special generated subtitles

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,879
will be indistinguishable from the

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,500
subjects of some position of the

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,379
richness therefore one can extract the

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,720
weakness by observing the view of the

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,319
adversary

95
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,319
encryption can be used to construct

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
several protocols due to the time limits

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,760
we only provide the hello idea about the

98
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,319
construction of the first freelance

99
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,619
types of simulable overviews transform

100
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,180
public keys for the instance that it

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,159
knows the weakness for only one of them

102
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,459
so that if it can only grab the one with

103
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,320
two subtitles standard in the left Round

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,779
digital times is identified by the

105
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,540
standard and through through encrypting

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,660
tool input strings in the meanwhile the

107
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,699
simulator the simulator simulation

108
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,639
receiver will extract both strings by

109
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,860
generating two wheels public keys and

110
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,139
described in both subtitles the

111
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,060
simulator simulating centers will

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,240
extract simple kids from Malaysia's

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,520
receiver using the individual reduction

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,259
technique and the retention

115
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,300
extractability property of our knowledge

116
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,280
incubation it's a women construction

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,220
fact that no matter how many secret keys

118
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,740
are extracted the simulator will always

119
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,139
be able to conclude the simulation we

120
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,300
refer to our we refer to our paper for

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,680
more details

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,840
that's all thank you for your attention
