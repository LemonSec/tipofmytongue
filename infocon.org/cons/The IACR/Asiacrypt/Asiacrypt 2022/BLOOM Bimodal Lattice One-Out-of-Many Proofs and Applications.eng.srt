00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,360
hi everyone my name is Khan and today

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
I'm going to talk about Bloom by model

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,140
that is one out of many proofs and

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,240
applications this is Joint war with

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,320
vadimir bashevsky

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,960
yeah are you ready oh can't solo on the

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,539
track with another here one out of many

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,240
so get used to it ah topic of the song

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,279
won't make you crazy but turn the

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
speakers up it's like this bass Province

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,020
said membership can easily fail linear

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,360
proves asymptotically it's Big L just

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,399
like acting this ain't really my thing

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
because if my head were linear size I

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,180
will start either way like Neo from The

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,700
Matrix I'm the one don't want to prove

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,100
it now Just Wanna Have Fun calamari and

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,860
Falafel I'm so hungry am I meals so good

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,379
I need the forking left times can be

20
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,480
tough for a little while so you need

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,520
something more than to make you smile so

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
we propose Bloom cause it's now or never

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
and we saw that it's hard like the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,379
submission server

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,880
my life

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,169
[Music]

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,180
it's time for some technical overview I

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,220
put the members in the Matrix call it

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,920
you multiply by selector name it V

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,380
that's a linear equation it's easy to

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,600
see don't want to commit to it that's

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
near size so we tends to decompose into

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
small VI's commit to each of them it's

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
not the crime and how to continue that's

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,820
for another time

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,220
and all new assumptions that I missed if

37
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,200
the signature size was a ticket I would

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,240
buy three because it's low like PhD

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,820
salary the song separate entry on Google

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,340
Scholar get tweeted by someone who paid

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,680
eight dollars the car wasn't enough so I

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,659
brought the bus no air conditioning

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,140
cause I got my fan

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,810
[Music]

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,780
we always

46
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,000
more than we thought so put your hands

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
up if you're also not we're all unique

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,099
more than we thought so put your hands

49
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,800
up if you're also not just one of many

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,160
yeah

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,630
out of money

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,700
so that concludes my talk thanks

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,599
everyone for watching
