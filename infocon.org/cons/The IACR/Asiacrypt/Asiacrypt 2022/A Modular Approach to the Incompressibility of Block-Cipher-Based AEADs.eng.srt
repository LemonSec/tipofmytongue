1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,319
social informatics Laboratories this is

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,200
a study on white book City AED mode of

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
White Volkswagen block ciphers this is a

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,599
joint work with takanurizabe and loss

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,020
this picture illustrates the usual Black

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,119
Box model where we study the stability

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,460
of cryptographic scheme or cryptographic

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,539
algorithm

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,060
we assume that there is an attacker and

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,399
there is the Black Box Oracle of the

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,840
target algorithm

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,840
responses

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,879
and here the important thing is we

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,860
assume that the attacker does not have

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,960
direct access to the implementation of

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,219
the algorithm

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,879
so this is the usual Black Box model

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,300
but in the real world sometimes we have

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,399
some problems with Black Box model

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,219
the problem is that there may exist a

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,159
kind of malware which includes into a

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,380
personal computer or a server where the

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,360
cryptographic algorithm is implemented

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,760
and this module may take some

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,979
information to the attacker

26
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,580
and in such a situation results shown in

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,619
the Black Box model guarantee no

28
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,540
security about the cryptographic

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,920
algorithm

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,020
and white box screen photography is a

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,939
technique to remedy such a situation

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,560
more concretely white box clear

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,420
photography has a technique to protect

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,759
data against attackers who may have full

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,040
and direct access to implementations of

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,079
cryptographic algorithms

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,600
and there are two major requirements in

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,759
white box cryptography resistance

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,860
against the key extraction and

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,560
resistance against code lifting

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,020
here key extraction is an attack to

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,420
recover the secret key and code lifting

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,100
is an attack to copy the entire

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,600
implementation

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,700
it is obvious that the resistance

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,680
against the key extraction is mandatory

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,200
but the important thing is the

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,479
resistance against the code listing is

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,818
also mandatory because if an attacker

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,280
can copy the entire implementation of

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,540
the cryptographic algorithm

52
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,720
to any cryptographic operation arbitrary

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,540
so the resistance uninstall the listing

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,620
is also mandatory

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,599
and the next I'd like to explain about

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,459
incompressibility

57
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,560
this is aesthetic illusion against code

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,900
lifting introduced by the recovery at

59
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,800
all

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
and roughly speaking incompressibility

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,420
formalizes the hardness of compressing

62
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,220
cryptographic implementations while

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,319
retrieving functionality

64
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,440
and intuitively in compressivity impress

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,959
the hardness for Model S to make useful

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,120
information

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,140
and the good point about

68
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,480
incompressibility or its variance is

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,540
that they are achievable without relying

70
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,879
on special Hardware

71
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,400
and there still exists high demand for

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,260
software only solutions in various

73
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
scenarios like cloud-based payment

74
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,260
services

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,660
so we also focus on incompressibility

76
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,940
and the next I'd like to explain the

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,920
motivation of our research

78
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,560
first there exists situo and they've

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
sent incompressible processors in

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,780
previous works but there exist no modes

81
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,060
of operation to convert 30 Block ciphers

82
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
into incompressible aeads

83
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,040
and the second there is no

84
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,260
incompressible AE stream achieving both

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,239
of confidentiality and authenticity

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,360
without relying on special Hardware in

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,220
the presence of leakage

88
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,099
and so a natural question is can't we

89
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,019
reduce incompressibility like security

90
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,599
Notions of an ADHD mode to those of

91
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,040
block service

92
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,379
this is a very natural question

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,260
but it seems new security Notions are

94
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
necessary for both overblock ciphers and

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,720
aeads because existing security Notions

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,000
do not seem suitable for reductions from

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,560
aeads to block ciphers

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
and these are Hawaii results first we

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,780
introduced the new white box certific

100
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,180
Notions for aeads and block ciphers and

101
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,079
so on

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
and the second we show that a weak

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,220
variant of public interference ability

104
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,079
impressive reduction between our new

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,280
certifications

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
and third we assure that the HIV

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,960
construction instantiated with a

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,940
sponge-based prf and counter mode

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,100
becomes avoidable consider Ada remote

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,780
over block service

111
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,419
and of course we introduced a new white

112
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,060
box Hitler wild Brook Brook Cipher with

113
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,460
space 256 16. and finally in our paper

114
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,560
we assumed that marvelous can be

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
detected if they consume lots of

116
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
computational resources or send huge

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,740
data outside but we assume nothing about

118
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,180
situation Hardware

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,220
so this is the summary of our results

120
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,979
please read our paper for more details
