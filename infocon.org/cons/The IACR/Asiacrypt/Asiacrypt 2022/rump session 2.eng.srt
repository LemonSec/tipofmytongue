1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,659
um but if you are speaking later there's

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,580
a program on the website so if you want

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,080
to know when you're speaking you can

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,000
check it on the Asian group website so

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,139
let's continue with the next talk

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,320
yeah hi everyone yeah so uh

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,600
and I received to use the privilege to

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,199
do a one minute advertisement during the

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,480
wrong session so yeah the most important

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,859
information is that we are looking for

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,960
for staff

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
and some attractions

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,719
um okay wait

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,180
okay yeah some restrictions so I hope

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,680
you enjoyed the uh our host so far and

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,620
uh tell us an even place and this is the

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,360
place you don't have time to enjoy

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,700
during the conference so come for a post

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
that and you will have one or two years

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,879
to enjoy

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,020
and now we have a

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,979
diverse crypto groups in Taipei with the

23
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,080
total we have me we have Reuben and the

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,540
boys and if you are interested in

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,420
working with any of us

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,960
send us your CV and

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,640
you'll be in Taipei enjoy the life here

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,020
and

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,180
every questions in particular we will

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,240
support you to go to campus

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,460
and that's it

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,640
thank you

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,340
Let's test uh excellent all right so

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,259
this is a quick Crypt announcement talk

35
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,240
but before

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,840
um

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,579
I am

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,299
I I discovered Nike everybody and I like

39
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,758
it conceptually and I'm trying to

40
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,619
understand why Nike is useful because

41
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm looking for excuse to work on it so

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
if you're working on Nike and you have

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,959
good application cases please come and

44
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,239
talk to me uh well

45
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,700
or drop me a message in the chat to talk

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,640
to you anonymously all right so

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,099
um queer Crypt

48
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,680
um so when where uh what and who so it's

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,819
a meet up for rainbow people will take

50
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,500
place at

51
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,239
at 9 30 plus what I'm saying DeLay So

52
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,379
starting in the next break in Hobby

53
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,040
um

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
for rainbow people have fun chat get to

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,599
know each other

56
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,080
um and so yeah wait but if you say oh

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,760
but I don't really identify

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,840
as a cryptographer can I come to queer

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,540
Crypt don't worry it's okay everyone's

60
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,440
welcome

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,160
thank you

hello are we present a review of our

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,700
team's participation in the Hager said

67

first

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
yes

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,480
oh yes first I will explain the Lego set

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,900
competition

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,500
is a hardware capture the flag

yes

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,400
our team is consists of five secretary

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
members or

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,600
oh yes

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,820
the members and

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,060
we Place seconds

94
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,580
place the second in Hangouts 20032 and

95
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,780
we focused on scca SI Channel analysis

96
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,820
vulnerabilities

97
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,259
and here are

98
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,180
the our public report

99
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,840
first of all is is

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,979
masking and

101
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,840
second second is

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,900
similar to first and third third

103
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,639
injection

104
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,020
and

105
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,979
Paul is fourth injection engagement

106
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,500
and this is

107
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,120
this is a summary or public report

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,440
thank you for listening

109
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,259
hello where's my site oh there's my

110
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,539
slide so I will be giving a very short

111
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,460
presentation about research work in

112
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,520
progress so if it makes you set I also

113
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,020
wrote funny things down there so that

114
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,880
should compensate

115
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,199
um so I'm going to talk about

116
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,539
formalization of the compressed oracles

117
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,280
oh there's the start slide

118
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,660
um so let me say what

119
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm talking about today is the uh

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,979
Quantum random Oracle you're probably

121
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,479
all familiar with random molecules maybe

122
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
with Quantum random oracles

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,580
and uh the tricky thing is that you can

124
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,259
put a superposition of input someone

125
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,240
already might show the next thing thank

126
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,280
you and then you get a superposition of

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,419
outputs

128
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,240
which is cool and important but makes

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,620
everything very hard

130
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,020
because each time you query the whole

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,259
function is queried and then you don't

132
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,479
you can't do things like lazy sampling

133
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,240
and so on uh

134
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,819
you don't have query logs like what has

135
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,380
been queried which you often need for

136
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,300
certain proof techniques so there are a

137
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,220
Quantum random Oracle model is really

138
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,960
annoying in many ways

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,240
and one of the techniques is the

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,860
compressed Oracle

141
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,440
technique by Mark zandre

142
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
and what it basically achieves

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,139
is that you get another register up here

144
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,360
that contains the state of the Oracle

145
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,340
which is initially empty and through

146
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,220
some magic mathematical tricks that I

147
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,259
will definitely not tell you about here

148
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,660
uh it actually works that there is a

149
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,940
query log and it's still compatible with

150
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,340
quantum mechanics so for example if we

151
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,460
query superposition of all access we get

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,380
a superposition of all the query logs

153
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,340
that have X some X mapping to some Y and

154
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,900
at first glance it looks all really

155
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,039
great so you do get a query log

156
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,580
um it's also great because you can get

157
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,080
techniques for efficiently simulating

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,599
the Oracle because it has a complex

159
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,740
complex representation and so on but

160
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,599
um the technique has

161
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,699
actually one big disadvantage

162
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,139
it's very confusing

163
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,240
and a lot of people have tried to

164
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,740
understand it some have managed some

165
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,599
have managed less

166
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,639
um and this all leaves us with the very

167
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,639
can we even make proofs in that why we

168
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,060
think that are correct and this is where

169
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,000
our work comes in so we are working on

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,759
formalizing all the mathematics of the

171
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,479
quantum uh compressed Oracle model in

172
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,080
Isabel Hall and the qhl tool so Isabel

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,479
Hall is the general purpose math term

174
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,140
prover Uhl tool is a

175
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,860
um

176
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,000
they're specific for for crypto

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
we have already done a lot definitions

178
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
and basic laws are formalized we have

179
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,360
formalized a lot of rules for how do we

180
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
preserve invariants like saying if

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
something hurts before like for example

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,459
if no no zero is in the output of your

183
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,500
Oracle and I do a query then no zero is

184
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,480
after what's in there

185
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
um we have implemented uh specifically

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,640
zero finding and collision resistance

187
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,240
but there's still a lot to do like

188
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,420
analyzing actual algorithms

189
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,959
um runtime analysis

190
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,018
and looking at more advanced protocols

191
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,660
and

192
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,700
um yeah what's faster than predicted

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,160
that's nice for queer group so you can

194
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
ask me anything uh but not now except if

195
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,640
you use the ticker too fast sorry

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
um but you can ask me anything offline

197
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,760
if you're interested in this line of

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,260
research and I will tell you more thank

199
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,519
you

200
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,000
okay

201
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,760
so hi everyone today I will talk about

202
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,180
uh see the cryptographic research center

203
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,980
at the Technology Innovation Institute

204
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,720
my name is Francisco Rodriguez Enriquez

205
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,899
and we are hiring and that's a reason

206
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,500
why we are talking about this uh the tii

207
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,320
is a recent uh institution that was

208
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,540
established in the UAE two years because

209
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,320
years ago it compresses 10 research

210
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,300
centers among them the cryptographic

211
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,839
research center CRC which is composed by

212
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,720
about 89 International researchers and

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,140
so forth developers we are like 55 plus

214
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,000
or researchers working in cryptography

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,459
so one of the largest cryptographic

216
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,920
groups in the world I would say uh TI

217
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,779
conducts and supports academic research

218
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,880
with various collaborations with

219
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,100
International universities funding of

220
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,560
PhD students and it is frequently

221
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
sponsored by ACR Flagship conferences

222
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
such as this one uh during 2022 alone

223
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,860
crcti researchers co-author papers in

224
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,820
all iicr Flags shape conferences and

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,899
workshops

226
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,959
uh just in case you are wondering where

227
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,500
Abu Dhabi is located uh this is in the

228
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,740
Middle East is United Arab Emirates

229
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,140
there are some memories maybe you have

230
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,260
heard a lot about Dubai we are one hour

231
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,820
of a far from Dubai is Abu Dhabi and is

232
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,860
about 1.4 million inhabitants in Abu

233
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,820
Dhabi

234
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,480
uh talking about our group uh well we do

235
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,720
all uh various classes of cryptography

236
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,240
it's a fairly comprehensive uh spectrum

237
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,560
and it was quantum crypto uh Hardware

238
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,800
implementations of crypto algorithms uh

239
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,779
um spiking neural networks crypto

240
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:02,040
analysis of course a cryptography in in

241
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,860
the cloud Etc uh we are a group of uh

242
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,779
senior researchers but mostly uh

243
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,540
Junior's researchers so if you are uh

244
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,519
and I know that I'm talking to a very

the next two talks are going to be

257
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,700
remotely so I'll be clicking the slides

258
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,820
and I hope the speakers are online

259
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,240
can you unmute yourself and yeah hello

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
can you hear me yes we can hear you oh

261
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,200
yeah yeah then please start slides

262
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,620
so hello everyone my name is Alexis and

263
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,959
together with Jason there uh we are

264
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,060
organizing a workshop about automated

265
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,399
and data JB and crypt analysis of

266
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,959
symmetric key Primitives

267
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,440
it will be held together with a SNS

268
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,019
Conference next year which will be in

269
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,120
Kyoto Japan in June

270
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,380
and next slide please

271
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,360
automatic hypnosis of symmetric at

272
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,540
Primitives using inside smt or MLP

273
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,680
solvers

274
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,779
or constraint programming is now a

275
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,579
standard Paradigm for analysis

276
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,060
next next

277
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,920
and more new approach is to use machine

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
learning or neural networks to find

279
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,220
distinguishers in a black box setting if

280
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,839
you have an interesting research about

281
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,959
one of these topics about

282
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,060
efficiency improvements or optimizations

283
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,000
of tools and involved Frameworks please

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,579
consider submitting to the workshop

285
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,740
next slide

286
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,019
so uh the papers will be published in

287
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,200
NCS proceedings volume of all acns

288
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,339
workshops

289
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,680
and there is a small price for papers

290
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,260
across all SNS workshops

291
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,420
the submission deadline is 15th of March

292
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,760
next year and the conference itself will

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,360
be held in June in Japan

294
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,100
so we're looking forward to your

295
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,380
submissions and thank you for your

296
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,620
attention

297
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
thank you

298
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,060
hi can you hear me

299
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,980
yes we can hear you

300
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,279
okay cool let's get started

301
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,500
yep so hello everyone and welcome to the

302
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,420
story about goofy going to grumpy for a

303
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,579
loan if you saw the website it says Tom

304
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,620
that's because goofy was a bit uh

305
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,180
ashamed to let everyone know that he's

306
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,800
out of dog toys but I managed to

307
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
convince him that we have cryptographers

308
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,120
and we don't judge people out of funds

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,740
um next slide

310
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,620
so the problem here is that goofy wants

311
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,560
to uh you know get a loan from grumpy um

312
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,420
and they want to negotiate a trust basis

313
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,959
uh for uh executing this transaction

314
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,399
um and the problem is how do they do

315
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,660
this because they don't know each other

316
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,219
beforehand next slide

317
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,540
well one of the ways in which they can

318
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,220
convince each other is basically show

319
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,139
some claims for example goofy says okay

320
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,699
I can put up my personal dog houses

321
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,839
called

322
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,699
and you know Grumpy in order to convince

323
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,800
gupi says that you know I never made a

324
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,860
bad loan to a dog

325
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,019
and uh essentially what they want to use

326
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,760
is a technology called verifiable

327
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
credentials which some of you are

328
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,300
familiar with web3 might have heard of

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,540
next slide

330
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,459
so in verifiable credentials essentially

331
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,560
you know goofy can uh you know produce

332
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
this claim along with the signature

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,860
that's attested by someone that grumpy

334
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,880
tasks such as the International

335
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,060
Association of cat Moguls and you know

336
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,459
grumpy could present a claim that is

337
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,260
adjusted by someone that goofy trusts

338
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,639
which is the league of you know toy

339
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,660
loving dogs

340
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,540
next slide

341
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,279
but they might also have attestations

342
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,500
from organizations that they don't

343
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,600
mutually trust for example goofy might

344
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,220
not you know might also have an

345
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,839
attestation from the club for water

346
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,760
sports but you know grumpy is not too

347
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,339
excited about water sports and uh you

348
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,839
know grumpy might have some affiliation

349
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,240
with 50 dog owners who do goofy is not

350
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,279
particularly excited about

351
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
so the next slide please

352
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,959
yeah so the problem that we are

353
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,519
concerned about is that maybe they want

354
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,139
to reveal the fact that they have some

355
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,820
mutually trusted certifying authorities

356
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,620
but they want to keep details of

357
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,660
additional certifiers private you know

358
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,000
for security reasons

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,120
so next slide

360
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,860
well this story has a happy ending

361
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,360
because it seems that they did manage to

362
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,100
negotiate a trust basis in a privacy

363
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,959
preserving way

364
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,720
then we get to the final slide

365
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,459
goofy let me know that they did this

366
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,780
because they apparently checked out a

367
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,220
paper that I recently wrote with my

368
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,900
amazing colleagues from IBM research

369
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,520
India and collaborators from IIT

370
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,500
kharagpur India so if you have time

371
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,480
maybe you want to check this out or tune

372
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,120
into our talk at ndss2023 thank you

373
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
thanks everyone we will have another

374
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,580
break of let's say about 10 minutes 10

375
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,879
minutes
