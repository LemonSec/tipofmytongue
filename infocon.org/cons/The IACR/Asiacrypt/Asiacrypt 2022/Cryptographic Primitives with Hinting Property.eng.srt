00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,080
hello and welcome to this talk titled

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,640
cryptographic Primitives with hinting

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,379
property this is based on joint work

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,940
with Navi

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,040
in real life a hint is typically

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,420
something that reveals partial

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,340
information about a secret such as a

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,199
password without revealing the entire

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,400
secret itself

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,859
depending on their usage things may or

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,240
may not be helpful

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
in this talk we focus on the

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,140
constructive usage of hinting properties

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,180
in the context of a fundamental and

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,680
widely used cryptographic primitive

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,380
called as pseudorandom generator or prg

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,440
in short traditionally a prg is an

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,480
expanding function that on input a

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,880
uniformly random seed outputs assute a

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,280
random expanded sequence of bits however

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,260
it provides no such due to Randomness

22
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,360
guarantees in its traditional form if

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,980
the distinguisher has some information

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,140
about the seed

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,940
but what if the distinguisher did have

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,980
some information about the seat for

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
example what if we take the output of

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,780
the prg which in this case is a sequence

29
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,360
of n strings y1 through y n and a

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,640
sequence of uniformly random strings Z1

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,619
through ZN and then for each position

32
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,159
from 1 through n we swap y i and z i if

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
the bit s i is equal to 1.

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
here is a toy example for S equals one

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,860
one zero zero zero one

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,380
clearly these two cross n Matrix of n

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,080
bit strings leaks some information about

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,299
each bit of the seed which is encoded

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,979
into the arrangement of the elements in

40
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,060
each row

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,880
a hinting prg introduced by copula and

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,400
Waters in crypto 2019 has the property

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,619
that this Matrix is due to random even

44
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,600
if the distinguisher has some hints

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,280
about the seed

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,259
hinting prgs have been used as a

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,540
cryptographic booster to transform CPA

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,400
Secure Public encryption and other

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Advanced forms of encryption into their

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,079
CCA secure counterparts in recent years

51
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,299
hinting prgs have found a myriad of

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,979
applications in other Advanced

53
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,720
cryptographic Primitives which makes

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,659
them very interesting to study

55
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,060
tinting prgs act have some apparent

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,040
similarities with another symmetric key

57
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,780
primitive namely circular secure

58
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,000
symmetric key encryption in fact one

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,979
could view the hinting property as a

60
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,660
deterministic form of circular security

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,720
with respect to the bits of the prg seed

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
however unlike circular secure symmetric

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
key encryption hinting prgs have

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
complicated cryptographic constructions

65
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,300
which are heavily rooted in structured

66
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,340
mathematical assumptions in addition

67
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,060
their complexity is also less understood

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,280
here is what the current Landscapes of

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,319
hinting prgs looks like in terms of

70
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,239
known ways of constructing them and of

71
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,560
their implications

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,840
in this paper we ask the following

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,060
questions can we realize simpler

74
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,800
constructions and proofs for hinting

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,140
prgs from a wider variety of assumptions

76
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,180
including plausibly post Quantum safe

77
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,580
isogeny based assumptions can we

78
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,260
naturally extend the hinting property

79
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,780
Beyond prgs to other cryptographic

80
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,480
Primitives finally can we have a more

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,040
concrete understanding of the

82
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,319
cryptographic complexity of hinting prgs

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,580
and if they necessarily require

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,500
mathematically structured public key

85
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,180
assumptions

86
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,640
our contributions are as follows in this

87
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
paper we present new extensions of the

88
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,319
hinting property to prfs and weak prfs

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,879
where the pseudo Randomness properties

90
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,159
hold in the presence of his about the

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,200
secret key across multiple evaluations

92
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,080
of the prf a hinting prf implies a

93
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,300
hinting weak prf which in turn implies a

94
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,400
hinting prg

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
we then show stronger implications of

96
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,720
the hinting property in particular a

97
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,000
hinting weak prf implies a full-fledged

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
circular secure symmetric encryption

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
scheme as opposed to a hinting prg which

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,180
only implies a one-time circular secure

101
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,519
symmetrical efficiency

102
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,200
we then show a simpler construction

103
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,540
strategy for hinting prgs and hinting

104
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,400
weak prfs from the standard dth

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680
assumption our constructions are more

106
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,140
direct and allow simpler proofs while

107
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,360
also yielding new instantiations from

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,340
plausibly Quantum safe assumptions over

109
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,620
isogeny based group actions

110
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,200
finally we show that public key

111
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
techniques are not inherently required

112
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
to realize cryptographic Primitives with

113
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,500
the hinting property concretely we show

114
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,900
a construction of hinting prf given just

115
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,980
a random order

116
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,959
this also yields a new black box

117
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,060
separation result between cryptographic

118
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,920
Primitives with the hinting property and

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,139
public key encryption

120
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,238
we also introduced in the paper a new

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
strengthening of the hinting property to

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,139
a functional heating property where the

123
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,180
adversary can also learn hints about

124
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
some function of the secret seat or the

125
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,979
secret key we show certain interesting

126
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,960
implications of the functional heating

127
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,780
property for example we show that a

128
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,880
functional hinting with prf with respect

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,160
to some function family implies in a

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,900
black box matter a KDM secure

131
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,580
symmetrical encryption scheme with

132
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,340
respect to the same functions this is a

133
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,900
new approach for achieving Black Box

134
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,060
constructions of KTM secure encryption

135
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,240
with respect to Boolean function factors

136
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,660
finally we also show an instantiation of

137
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,580
functional hinting with prfs from the

138
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,620
dth Assumption where the construction is

139
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,000
with respect to the function family

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
consisting of projective quadratic

141
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,020
functions and functions of higher degree

142
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,900
over the bits of the secret key

143
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,240
for more details about our results and

144
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,699
