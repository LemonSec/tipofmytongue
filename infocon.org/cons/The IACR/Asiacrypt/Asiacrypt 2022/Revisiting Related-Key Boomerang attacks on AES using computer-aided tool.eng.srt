00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,500
hello everyone this talk is about

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,899
revisiting related key Boomerang attacks

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,900
on AES using computer-aided tool

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,660
this work is joined with Patrick Marie

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,900
Pierre Elan and wah

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,240
AES is one of the most widely used

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,820
encryption algorithms in the world

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,100
since it was first introduced many

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,720
researchers have studied its design

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
looking to probe the algorithm's

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,900
security

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,539
in recent years Boomerang attack was

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,399
found to be powerful against many block

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,820
ciphers especially full-round AES

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,640
a few years later several milk models

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,379
were introduced to search automatically

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,600
for Boomerang distinguishers and

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,540
Boomerang attacks on block ciphers but

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,100
they can only be used when the key

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,620
schedule is linear

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,260
in this work a new model is introduced

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,780
to deal with non-linear key schedules as

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,940
is the case for AES

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,760
this model is more complex and too slow

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,620
for an exhaustive search

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,140
however when some hints are added to the

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,360
solver it found a new Boomerang attack

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,720
against full AES 192.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,540
its complexity is 2 to the power of 52

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,340
times lower than the one presented by

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,560
biryukov and kovradovic

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
and we also recover the attack on AES

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
256 of biryukov

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,759
for AES 192 we were able to find a

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,740
better attack it is like the original

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,860
version we use the same lower Trail but

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,020
for the upper Trail the same but the

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,360
position of the active byte is different

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,759
our distinguisher has the probability of

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,640
2 to the power of minus 108 instead of 2

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,640
to the power of minus 110 it is a bit

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,439
better but almost has the same

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,600
probability

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,939
we expand to mount a boomerang key

45
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,820
recovery attack in this case it is much

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,619
much better

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,840
here is the zoom on the input of both

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,500
attacks as you can see in our attack we

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,299
know much more information on Plain text

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,600
than in biryukov's attack

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,940
in general we found the current best

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,239
related key Boomerang attack on AES 192

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,959
with 2 to the power of 124 time 2 to the

54
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,340
power of 124 data and 2 to the power of

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,500
79.8 memory complexities which is better

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,599
than the one presented by biryukov and

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,180
kovradovic at Asia Crypt 2009 with

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,200
complexities 2 to the power of 176 2 to

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
the power of 123 2 to the power of 152

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
respectively this represents a huge

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,260
Improvement in the time and memory

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,599
complexity illustrating the power of

63
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,260
automatic Tools in cryptanalysis

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,720
if you are interested I hope you watch

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
my talk on Wednesday morning

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,620
and I am really looking forward to

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,480
seeing all of you in Asia Crypt next

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,660
month
