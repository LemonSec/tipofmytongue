00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,620
hello my name is Joel Wang this is a

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,779
jump to work with stranger like shahan

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,059
Lindley and Jian Wong the topic is

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,219
anonymous public key encryption and the

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,840
Corruptions

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,660
firstly let me introduce some background

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,859
information

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,840
for public encryption and the

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,060
Corruptions both the secret keys and

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,760
messages could be leaked as far as we

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
know the first notion of anonymity for

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,099
pke under Corruptions is proposed by

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,719
behemoda atel in 2020 in their work

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,300
Anonymous CR secure and ISO secure pke

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,820
is employed to build an evolving

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,559
Community proactive secret sharing

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,260
scheme

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,700
unfortunately there are still some

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,420
problems left no known pke achieves they

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,360
are Anonymous CR security the adversary

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,399
is not allowed to obtain any security

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,039
before seeing several text and each

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,440
public key is used to include a single

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
message

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,420
moreover both confidentiality and

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,880
anonymity and the Corruptions are needed

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,900
for constructing an ecpss scheme but we

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,240
noticed that for ISO security the

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,700
adversary is able to open a specified

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,820
subset of the training Q7 text and for

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,640
anonymous CR security the adversary does

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,460
not have this ability

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,100
so these two security Notions are

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,840
formalized under different types of

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,060
Corruptions

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,060
focusing on these problems we Define

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,420
Anonymous isok and C security for pke

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,060
which is anonymity and the receiver

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,759
selective opening attacks in the K20

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,939
setting and adaptive user Corruptions

41
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,040
and then we Define a confidentiality

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,780
notion under the same types of

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,380
Corruptions

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,759
now we turn to the definition of

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,600
anonymous ISO KNC Security in the real

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,899
game there are totally n public Keys the

47
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,939
anniversary specifies a public key

48
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,960
distribution in KT training messages in

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,860
other words

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,380
the anniversary knows all the encrypted

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,540
messages but he does not know which

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
public keys are used for encryption

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,500
exactly

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,020
the anniversary can make two kinds of

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Oracle queries user crafting queries and

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,120
selective opening queries

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,580
for the user corrupting queries the

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,780
adversary submits I and receives ski for

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,700
the selective opening queries the

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,340
adversary queries on joint and receives

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,860
as a knife chain which means that he

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,640
asked to open the JSF text finally he

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,180
returns output

64
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,160
the ideal game is similar except that

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,019
there are no public keys and no

66
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,220
encryptions

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,459
so we use the indices of public keys to

68
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,280
replace the public Keys note that the

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,560
simulator will not receive any self text

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
so she does not have any information

71
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,300
about the indices of the public Keys

72
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,060
corresponding to the an open and

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,760
uncorrupted users this is how we

74
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,280
formalize the notion of anonymous ISO

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
KNC security

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,319
the confidentiality notion under the

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
same type of corruption is similarly

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,819
defined the main difference is that the

79
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,400
distribution of public Keys is replaced

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,280
with a distribution of messages and all

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,760
the other details are similarly modified

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,420
and then we show that Anonymous ISO KNC

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,760
CPA security implies Anonymous CR

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
security and the corresponding

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,980
confidentiality implies the standard ISO

86
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,140
case security

87
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
for constructions we ensure a framework

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,599
of constructing pke achieving both

89
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,260
Anonymous ISO KNC CCA security and

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,480
confidentiality under the same types of

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,599
Corruptions

92
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,239
specifically we propose a primitive code

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
key and message in non-committing

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,060
encryption kmnce and use it to show a

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,940
pke scheme achieving both of the two new

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,180
security requirements and then we use a

97
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,159
new primitive core key openable hash

98
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,880
proof system to construct km and CE

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,478
the obtain mdth based TK scheme has

100
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,699
compact same text and tight security

101
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,699
reduction and is the first pk scheme

102
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,060
achieving Anonymous CR security

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,699
well this is the brief introduction of

104
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,919
our work thanks for your attention
