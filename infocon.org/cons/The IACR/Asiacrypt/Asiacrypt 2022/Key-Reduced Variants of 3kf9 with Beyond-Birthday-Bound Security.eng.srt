1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,899
uh hello everyone my name is yobinson

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,480
today I'm going to talk about our Asian

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
Curry paper key reduce variant of 3km9

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,179
with Beyond bus bound security this is

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,440
Joint work with foreigners

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
a 3km knight is the three key CBC type

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,000
Mark that enhances the standardized

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,660
integrated algorithm S9 let's also

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,119
called 3gpp Mark

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,900
uh it is the sequential mode with our

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,420
field multiplication it has Beyond

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,719
security and expected to be a postpone

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,000
candidate in constraint environment that

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,920
we instance with that way block

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,340
sidewalks

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,879
uh the problem to reduce the number of

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,680
key of 3K F9 is the challenging problems

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,340
uh two variants of two cat nine and one

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,520
kf9 will propose to reduce key size for

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,199
efficiency

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,600
but recently 401k9 uh Lauren at all has

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,700
proposed their birthday Brown attack by

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,400
exploring the fixed function

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,860
and for a 2K F9 uh subsequently a solid

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,520
or also proposed one query attack and

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,740
also a similar attack

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,619
when the fixed function is added

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,860
and says this attack invaded the layer

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
security proofs

30
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,420
in his work we visited previous

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,000
construction of key reduce radiation of

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
C cabinet as light as light and Analysis

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,079
with no in security analysis

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,259
interestingly we find flat a single

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,900
doubling at the end can not only fix 2km

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,119
Knight to go belong the first debunk

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,640
security but also have 1K of Knight to

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,860
copy on the bus debunk security

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,700
here is our proposal and true cam 9 we

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,340
simply add a single doubling near the

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,799
end the single doubling can be achieved

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,619
by one piece shift and one condition X

43
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,800
all with some coins some constant which

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,220
can be very efficient

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,340
and follow one key version uh here is

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,000
the N1 kf9 we also add a single single

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,280
doubling at the knee at the end but here

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
is a additional constraint that limited

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,440
space should be preflex free as the

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,200
original series Mark there is no query

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,319
the prefix of the other let's requiring

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,179
approved but no attacks currently

53
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,599
if we compare n2k9 with a emac

54
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,340
and tokem that can provide higher

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,040
security guarantee with one additional

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,860
block cycle current one doubling

57
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,200
uh lotopa can be regarded as the

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,660
e-marked letter flash block is always

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,540
zero

60
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,760
4 and 2km9 the Security Bank is being

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,260
face spray bomb

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,860
and does this key rebound can be maybe

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,440
improved for while the immaculate

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,379
Security Bank is only per step down and

65
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,720
the bank is typed so there is no ruined

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,940
to improve respond

67
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,780
and uh we will compare n1k F9 with the

68
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,340
CPC mark

69
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,379
then you also provide higher security

70
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,540
guarantee with only one conditional

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,500
block set for core and one doubling

72
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,879
similarly the top part can also be

73
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
regarded as the Serena CBC Mark where

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,819
the last block you start with zero

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,700
and the bandw and one cabinet is priyang

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,099
replace and this pump may be improved

77
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,739
for while the Bound for the CBS Mark is

78
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,060
only birthday bomb and the pump is tight

79
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,360
there's no room to improve in Florida

80
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,459
so as a conclusion

81
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,819
we propose the two new key reduce

82
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,060
variant of 2K9 with the banks created

83
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,940
and compared to emac and CBC Mark the

84
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,040
additional cost to provide the highest

85
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,140
security guarantee expected to be

86
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,579
minimal for n2kf9 and 1kf9 it only

87
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,560
requires one additional broadside for

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,019
core and one doubling

89
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,040
uh thanks
