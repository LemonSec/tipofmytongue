1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,039
okay

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,219
hello everyone and welcome to this

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,620
abstract video on a new eye surgery

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,079
representation and application to

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,799
cryptography

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,640
so the goal of this paper is really to

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,519
explore new directions for icertainty

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,580
based cryptography and for that we are

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,320
going to introduce some other

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,880
representation which is a new

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,640
representation for Isis Denise of

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,680
arbitrary degree

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,200
and of course once we have this

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,440
presentation we want algorithms to

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,360
manipulate it and make the usual

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,180
computations we need from an isogenes so

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,420
our second contribution is the new

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,879
algorithms to manipulate this support

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,640
representation efficiently for any

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
degree

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,660
then we introduce a new heart problem

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,140
called the soap for suborder to Ideal

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,400
problem

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,720
and this problem basically realizes the

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,240
gap between the sub-order representation

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
and previously known isogene

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,340
representation and the harness of this

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,320
problem implies that this is about the

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,420
representation basically is not

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,960
equivalent to in particular the ideal

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
representation that we can derive

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
naturally from the daring correspondence

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
for isogenes

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,540
and this is quite nice because this

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,159
means that basically we have a gap two

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,439
we have two isogeneous presentations for

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
which we have efficient algorithms but

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,460
the two are not equivalent with one

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,020
another and so we are going to exploit

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,979
that Gap to introduce a new past Quantum

41
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,720
non-interactive key exchange called P

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,780
side or prime sidh and the Heart the

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,340
security of this scheme is really based

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,759
on the soap so more concretely the idea

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,979
is really to use the kind of diagrams

46
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,380
that we have for sidhs this means that

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,860
we take two degree co-prime with another

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,740
and then we use isotenuse of co-prime

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,340
degree to build this commutative diagram

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,640
and the idea is to use this ideal

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,580
representation as secret key and the

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,800
public keys are these new suborder

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,020
representation and so the gap between

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,780
the two which is the syp is really the

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,020
key recovery problem of our key exchange

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
and using our new algorithmic tools the

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
participant will be able to use this

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,640
about our representation to complete

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,560
this diagram and up to the two curves

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,319
EAB and EBA which are isomopic framework

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,540
with one another and this will allow the

62
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,459
two participants to derive a command

63
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,900
secret key

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,120
for this protocol to be secure it's

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,940
going to be very important to have a big

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,560
Prime decree for the Phi a and 5B

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,280
and in fact the performance profile

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,400
are really similar to Seaside we have a

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,379
Quantum sub-exponential attack and

70
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,000
non-integrative key exchange thanks to a

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,220
verifiable public key okay because we

72
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,080
have also a verified verification

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,220
mechanism to check the Integrity of the

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,400
suborder

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,260
of course

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,580
these two Protocols are also different

77
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,680
and in practice P side is not going to

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,180
be as efficient as Seaside but the

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,099
structure the mathematical structure and

80
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,739
the heart problems are different

81
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,780
so possibly we could have some

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,400
applications where P side could be

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,879
applied and not Seaside and well

84
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,640
this paper is really about introducing

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,239
new ideas and so only time will tell us

86
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,340
where these leads us

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,159
thank you for listening if you want more

88
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,959
detail you can look at the ePrint

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,299
version and otherwise I invite you to

90
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,599
look at the live talk on Tuesday thank

91
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,738
you very much goodbye
