00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,980
hi I'm Leo I'm going to talk about the

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,440
summary of our work functional

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,440
encryption with secure key listing

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,200
this is a joint work with field Channel

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,619
our question is whether we can copy

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,600
protect or delete data

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,779
it is easy to copy classical digital

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,900
information as much as you want

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,739
moreover it is hard to prove that we

10
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,000
delete classical information

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,520
however if we consider Quantum

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
information the situation is completely

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,500
different

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,800
in general it is impossible to copy

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,739
Quantum state by the no cloning theorem

16
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,739
in addition we could prove that Quantum

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,500
information is deleted by the

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,159
uncertainty principle

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,040
there are many unconable cryptographic

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,979
Primitives or cryptographic Primitives

21
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,880
with flat by the deletion by using those

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,899
Quantum properties

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,920
in this work we focus on functional

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,360
encryption

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,600
in functional encryption we can generate

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
a functional dedication key where a

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,100
function f is hardwired

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,280
when we receive a cipherfects of the

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,600
plaintix X we can compute f of x by the

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,798
functional education t

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,740
the question in this work is whether we

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,500
can copy protect or delete functional

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,560
decoration keys by making those keys

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,280
Quantum States

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,200
we propose the notion of functional

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,619
encryption with City key listing

37
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,500
in this printable a functional decision

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,780
key is quantum state

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,080
and we also generate a verification key

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,640
for each decryption key

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,060
we can delete a functional decision key

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
and the generator certificate for

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,179
deletion

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,180
if the certificate is varied then we can

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,459
guarantee that the functional education

46
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,900
key was deleted

47
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,780
after the deletion we can no longer

48
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,340
decrypt hypothetists

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,959
we also proposed a stronger motion

50
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,620
single decrypter functional encryption

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,080
in this primitive a functional

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,900
definition key is quantum State as a fee

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,660
with secular key listing

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,720
the difference is that we do not have a

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,540
deletion process and the copying key is

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,260
prevented

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
even if we try to generate two entangled

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
Quantum States

59
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,239
from a functional reduction key one of

60
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,459
them does not have the decryption

61
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,060
capability

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,099
in this work we present a bounded

63
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,980
Collision resistance secret key Fe with

64
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,319
secure key adhesync scheme based on

65
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,599
Boundary functions

66
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,200
foreign

67
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,560
scheme based on indistinguishability

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,860
obfuscation and one-way functions

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,500
please attend my talk or read our paper

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,480
