00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,659
hi I am Ashwin jha I will be presenting

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,759
the paper towards tight security bounds

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,240
for Omak xcbc and tmacc at asiagrip 2022

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,639
this is a joint work with shomo Jato

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,500
padya and Mr nandi

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,540
in my presentation I will be focusing on

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,240
four main points first I will describe

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,460
omac xcbc and tmacc which are popular

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,760
CBC Mac variants note that CMAC and ISO

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,500
standard and nist recommended algorithm

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,380
is just a simple variant of omeg so our

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,199
results implicitly apply to CMAC as well

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
second I will discuss the existing

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,860
security bound which says that the

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,540
security holds up to the square root of

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,780
2 to the N over L queries where n is the

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,640
block size of the block Cipher and L is

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,280
the maximum message length

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,140
third I will talk about the tightness of

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,480
the existing bounds interestingly there

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,520
is no matching attack for the existing

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,620
bound and the general belief is that the

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,480
bounds can be improved up to the minimum

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,000
of square root of 2 to the n and 2 to

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,980
the N over l

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,020
so the existing bounds have a quadratic

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,699
degradation as compared to the fourth

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,799
load bound and it was not clear up to

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,200
now how it can be improved

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
finally I will present our improved

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,640
bound which effectively says that the

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,380
security holds up to the minimum of

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,960
square root of 2 to the n and 2 to the N

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,659
over L squared queries while we do not

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,520
achieve the photo bound due to the

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,619
additional L Factor our result is still

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,560
an improvement over the existing bound

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,119
to get an idea of the quantitative

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,540
Improvement Take N equals 128 and

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,040
consider this graph of the number of

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
queries versus the maximum message

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,460
length

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,560
here black curve in denotes the existing

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
bound and red curve denotes the focal

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,259
bound

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,939
obviously there is a clear daylight

47
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,640
between the two bounds

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,159
now if we put the new bounds that is the

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,439
curve in green you can see that our

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,060
bounds are very close to the focal

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,700
bounds up to the message length of 2 to

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,479
the 30 blocks or roughly 64 gigabyte and

53
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,040
are still better than the existing ones

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,159
up to roughly 64 terabyte long messages

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,460
for further details I will invite you to

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,919
my Asia Crypt talk thank you
