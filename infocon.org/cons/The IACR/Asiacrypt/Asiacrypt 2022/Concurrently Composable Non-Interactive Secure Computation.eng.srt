I'm Andrew Morgan and this is the short

2022 presentation on concurrently

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,120
composable non-interactive secure

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,440
computation

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,599
non-interactive secure computation or

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,639
nisk refers to two-party secure

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,139
computation with minimal round

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,300
complexity that is two single message

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,340
rounds where only one party the receiver

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,160
receives the output from a protocol

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,080
we focus on fully malicious security

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,240
where intuitively an adversary with full

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,859
control over one of the parties even

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,300
having the ability to deviate

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,399
arbitrarily from the protocol should

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
learn nothing about the honest party's

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,880
input besides what they could infer from

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,860
the output of the computation we

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,960
formalize this as simulation-based

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
security where an adversary's view of

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,680
the real execution of the protocol

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,180
should be indistinguishable from the

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,280
review of an idealized execution where

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,260
messages are simulated independently of

26
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
inputs while a trusted third-party

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,980
computes the functionality

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,440
in fact nisk with malicious Security in

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,820
the play model is well known from

30
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,379
standard assumptions though we note that

31
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,480
a relaxation to Super polynomial time

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,239
simulation is required to circumvent a

33
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,860
classical impossibility result and

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,479
Achieve security with fewer than four

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,740
rounds

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,080
in our work however we investigate the

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,880
achievability of stronger Notions of

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,280
security specifically to intuitive

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
desert rather that are not provided by

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,220
classical definitions of

41
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,460
simulation-based security are

42
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,960
composability or a guaranteed at

43
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
security of a composition of protocols

44
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,439
can be based on the security of its

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,860
components and concurrency a guaranteed

46
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,600
that security of a protocol still holds

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,979
when many instances can be run

48
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,900
concurrently and an adversary might try

49
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,640
to adaptively use the views of certain

50
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
instances to break others

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,140
the first notion of security to consider

52
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,000
and provide both guarantees is the

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,579
universal composability or UC framework

54
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,700
introduced by kinety in 2001 which

55
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,740
requires security against an environment

56
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,780
able to invoke many instances of a

57
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,299
protocol and control Communications and

58
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,979
interactions of multiple corrupted

59
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,899
parties in those instances

60
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,119
furthermore there exists an analog of

61
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,460
super polynomial time simulation for UC

62
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,100
security known as angel-based or

63
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,860
oracle-aded UC security that preserves

64
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,720
both the composability and concurrency

65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,060
guarantees specifically it allows the

66
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,280
simulator and environment both access to

67
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,860
a super polynomial helper Oracle or

68
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,780
Angel but otherwise restricts them to

69
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,340
polynomial time

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,739
of course since UC security is strictly

71
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,080
stronger than Standalone security it has

72
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,879
historically been far more difficult to

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,620
prove the existence of UC secure

74
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,260
computation protocols and especially of

75
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,780
ground efficient UC secure protocols

76
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,580
while the theoretical minimum of two

77
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,319
rounds was achieved for Standalone

78
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,840
Security even prior to our results

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,459
the best known protocols for

80
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,019
concurrently secure two-party

81
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,120
computation even table and composability

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,940
run in two simultaneous broadcast rounds

83
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,560
and would thus require three single

84
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,200
message rounds and the best known UC

85
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,819
secure protocol runs in a large

86
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,819
unspecified constant number of rounds

87
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,160
thus the question has remained open can

88
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,739
we achieve concurrently composable

89
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,060
non-interactive or two-round secure

90
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,640
computation with malicious SPS Security

91
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,459
in the plane model our work answers this

92
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,500
question in the affirmative we construct

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,180
and prove the security of nisk with

94
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,120
Oracle aided UC Security based on two

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
underlying assumptions

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,620
a standalone SPS secure nisk protocol

97
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,780
which we augment to achieve UC security

98
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,140
by using a non-interactive tag-based

99
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,879
commitment scheme which satisfies CCA

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,340
security a strengthened notion of hiding

101
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,260
analogous to chosen ciphertext security

102
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,879
for encryption

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
in my full talk I'll focus on presenting

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
our main serum our construction of a UC

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,900
secure nisk protocol And discussing at a

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,459
high level how does sub-components

107
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,959
combine to achieve the strengthened

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
notion of security

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,260
additionally I'll discuss the

110
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,060
requirement of non-interactive CCA

111
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,220
secure commitments which are thus far

112
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,140
known only based in relatively complex

113
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,480
assumptions and highlight our second key

114
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
result which demonstrates that in fact

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
non-interactive CCA secure commitments

116
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,019
can be constructed based on uc's secure

117
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,299
nisk hence showing that these

118
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,040
commitments are both sufficient and

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,379
necessary for UC secure nisk or in other

120
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,760
words to the assumptions for a

121
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,620
construction are essentially minimal

122
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,000
while details of the construction

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
improve of the second result are out of

124
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
scope for my talk I'll conclude by

125
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,579
noting that they along with the complete

126
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,019
construction and proof of the Mis

127
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,940
protocol can be found in our paper
