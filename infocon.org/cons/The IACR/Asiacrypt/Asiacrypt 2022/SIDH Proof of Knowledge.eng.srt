1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,940
welcome to this quick introduction of

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,279
sidh group of knowledge which is joint

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,500
work with Luca defeo Stephen Galbraith

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,360
and Lucas Doberman

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,340
so our setting is that we've got an

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,740
isogeneous secret exogeny from one

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,139
elliptic curve e0 to a second elliptic

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,199
curve E1 so the exogeny here is our

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,359
secret key and the two curves we can

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,220
reveal publicly and it's assumed that

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,840
it's difficult to compute the secret key

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,119
given only those two curves

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,340
a natural question then arising is that

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,080
how do you prove knowledge of such an

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,239
isogony if you're only going to give out

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,579
the two curves and that says natural

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,100
applications and signatures distributed

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,739
key generation to prevent adaptive

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,899
attacks and so on

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,120
the original sadh paper actually

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,100
included An Elegant identification

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,800
scheme which looks like this we've got

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,340
our secret isogen E5 we pick a ephemeral

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,879
PSI to a different elliptic curve E2

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,920
and then we complete what's called an

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,620
sadh squared where we essentially doing

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,319
a key exchange without self and we both

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,360
both these parts commute and arrive at

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,760
the same elliptic curve E3 we commit to

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,760
E2 and E3 and then we receive a single

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
bit challenge

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,360
challenge equals zero we provide the two

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
vertical sides of the square which are

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
ephemeral engine reveal anything about

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,420
the secret and challenge equals one we

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,640
reveal the bottom the bottom isogene

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
here which again shouldn't reveal

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,540
anything about our secret because

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
um there's no way to bring this

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,979
information back to e0

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,560
the extractor that's proposed in the

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,900
original proof of sound Misfits um

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
scheme essentially assumes that you can

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,119
pull back the Spy Prime from the bottom

45
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,560
along the jewel of PSI to e0 to recover

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,220
the osogen E5 from e0 to E1

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,740
um unfortunately though we showed in our

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,479
paper that this proof isn't actually

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
valid

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
um with a simple counter example so

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,259
we'll start with a random walk from e0

52
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,020
to a curve we'll call E2 we'll take

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,500
another random walk to another curve E3

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,300
followed by a third random walk to the

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,560
curve E1

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,819
so

57
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,760
we've now we're going to give out E1 as

58
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,920
our public key and claim that we know an

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,739
isogeny from e0 to E1

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,840
we can answer both challenges here

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
because we've got vertical sides we've

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,680
got the horizontal side along the bottom

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,379
but will there actually even exist such

64
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,020
if I probably not we've just taken quite

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,580
a large degree walk

66
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,260
um so we probably won't actually have

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,360
any misogyny of the correct degree but

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,660
between e0 and E1

69
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
um there's independent work that's also

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,620
demonstrated other soundness issues for

71
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,700
the stem

72
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,459
and in our paper we also demonstrate um

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,420
that the um proof of Urbana and jowl so

74
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,640
that suffers from similar um soundness

75
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
issues

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,260
so our initial goal was to fix these and

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,180
propose a secure scheme for proving

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,540
knowledge of an East ADH secret key

79
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,459
unfortunately as most people here

80
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,040
already probably know

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,800
um there have been some pretty

82
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,480
significant attacks on each idh since

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,220
this work was submitted

84
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,920
um and so given that this ADH public key

85
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
including the two torsion points it's

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,879
actually possible to now recover the

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,459
secret key in polynomial time which

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,819
makes some of our scheme that we propose

89
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,080
in our work

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
um

91
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,080
not as useful as they probably once were

92
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,000
but we'll talk about that in our

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,739
presentation

94
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,080
so we've actually proposed two schemes

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,040
in our paper the first is a um

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
zero knowledge proof of knowledge of an

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,580
isogeneous degree

98
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,400
um L to the E some smooth degree isogeny

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,620
between two curves

100
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,500
um it uses ternary challenges and

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
actually doesn't include any information

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
about the two torsion points in this ADH

103
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
it's just knowledge of the nisogyny

104
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
between two curves so this this scheme

105
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,360
is actually completely unaffected by the

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
attacks on this ADH

107
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,099
our second scheme though

108
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,720
um was designed to prove correctness of

109
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,760
the torsion points in an sadh key to

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,860
prevent attack the attacks like the gpsd

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,180
attack

112
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,040
um so unfortunately because this game

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
requires um giving out torsion points

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
the polynomial time key recovery attack

115
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,259
does apply to this this protocol

116
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,080
however there have been variants of this

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,139
idh proposed since the attacks hiding

118
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,960
the degree or the action on the torsion

119
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,660
basis so it's likely that our second

120
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,060
protocol can still be adapted to prove

121
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,940
non-trivial statements um about this ADH

122
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,699
variance keys

123
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,680
so we look forward to having you come to

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,960
our presentation and giving more

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,240
information about our protocols and the

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,960
uses thereof

127
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,500
thank you very much
