00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,759
this is a short video abstract of my

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,059
Azure Crypt 2022 paper General

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,080
properties of quantum beat commitments

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,860
from China university

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,400
The Story begins with since our world is

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,439
quantum we can ask the following

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,240
motivating question

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,760
can we base unconditional Quantum

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,580
cryptography solely built on principles

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,579
of quantum mechanics

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,800
Stephen Wiesner might be the first

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
person to explore this possibility

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
back in early 1970s he first studied

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
Quantum money

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,040
inspired by wisner's idea two Primitives

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,739
ending with different Fates were

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,140
intensively started in early days of

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,520
quantum crypto

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,980
the first plaintiff is quantum key

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,719
distribution

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,420
Burnett and blessed and independently

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,500
Earth

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,899
have proposed two slightly different

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,860
protocols both of them can be shown

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,080
unconditionally secure

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
the second primitive is quantum bit

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,680
commitment

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,260
there are many purpose schemes however

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,299
all of them will finally broken

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,600
the security of qpc is finally settled

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,619
in Middle 90s males and independently

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,040
law and child finally prove that Quantum

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,500
beat commitment is impossible

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,680
with a big blow to ambitious researchers

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,700
in Quantum crypto since then a qpc seems

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,880
dead

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,759
in a subsequent two decades there was

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,060
little progress towards QBC until

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,100
recently a QBC revives but in 55 human

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,000
sense

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
let it be compromised to introduce

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,920
computational hardness study

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,380
computational QBC

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,320
this is ironically in contrast to the

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,479
original motivation of starting Quantum

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,520
crypto unconditionally

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,280
however this is actually the starting

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,239
point of this work

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,599
specifically this work proposed to base

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,620
Quantum crypto on computational QBC or

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,319
is to querying the complexity theoretic

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,360
objects

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,640
there are similar exciting and somewhat

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
surprising results are obtained towards

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,580
this research Direction in this and its

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,140
follow-up work

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,319
now let me go into some detail

59
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,780
seeing from the complexity theoretical

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,379
perspective computational qpc induces

61
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,319
two clean and simple to State complexity

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
theoretic objects that turn out to be

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
equivalent

64
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,140
the first object is a pair of

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,000
efficiently generated Quantum states

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
that are computationally

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,140
indistinguishable but statistically

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,260
distinguishable it is called EFI in a

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,000
follow-up work

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,760
the second object can be viewed as a

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,099
computational navigation of one month's

72
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,879
theorem we just call it a woman

73
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,360
we propose to study computational QBC or

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,840
equivalently EFI or woman at the basic

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,959
complexity assumption in medical script

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,019
based on the following reasons

77
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,280
first

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,379
prior and this work show that

79
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,860
computational qpc is both sufficient and

80
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,900
necessary for several important

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,180
Primitives including Quantum material

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,599
knowledge and Quantum oblivious transfer

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,299
and more recently work extend results

84
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,680
are further along this line of research

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
second

86
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,180
EFI has a classical counterpart that is

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,780
well know equivalent to Runway functions

88
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,000
third QBC or EFI or woman is weaker than

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
two other candidate complexity

90
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,860
assumptions in medical Crypt namely a

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,659
Quantum secure one with functions and

92
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,480
the pseudo random Quantum States

93
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,298
fourth our study indicates that

94
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,079
definitions of computational qpc or EFI

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,780
or women are quite robust

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
several interesting equivalences among

97
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
different variants of them can be

98
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,699
established

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
in this last picture we summarize

100
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,340
equivalences we have established in this

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,699
work a represented by this red and

102
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,919
orange allows

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,740
this picture also summarizes our current

104
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,800
knowledge towards exploring basic

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,180
complexity assumption in medical Crypt

106
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,300
that's all what I want to say thanks for

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,900
your listening
