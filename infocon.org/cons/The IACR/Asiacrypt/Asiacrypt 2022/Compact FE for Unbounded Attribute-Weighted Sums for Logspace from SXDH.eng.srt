00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,599
hi everyone I am Tapas this is a short

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,299
presentation of our what compact TV for

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,519
unbounded attribute weighted sums for

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,639
log space from ssdh it's a joint to work

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,160
with both his daughter and karsh

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,440
in function encryption the setup

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,720
Authority generates a master public key

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
mpk and a master's secret key msk using

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,359
msk the authority computes the secret

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,060
key SKF corresponding to any function f

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,400
and distributes the secret key to the

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,840
user of the system

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,559
using NPK a data owner encrypts his or

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,899
her data and publishes the ciphertech

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,120
ctm corresponding to the messaging

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,660
finally a user decrypt ctm using the

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,760
secret key SKF and learns the function

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
of the message m f of n

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
simulation security is the most desired

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,500
security model for a fee which roughly

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,140
says that given functional secret Keys

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,780
Escape 1 Escape 2 escape 3. the

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,520
adversary can only recover the

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,340
functional values of the messaging and

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,379
nothing else about the message from the

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,180
ciphertech ctm

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,760
if he has been built for General class

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,520
of functions such as student machines or

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400
all circuits however existing

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,740
constructions are inefficient and or

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,500
impractical these are bounded Collision

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
resistance and depends on heavy

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,880
cryptographic tools such as

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,460
indistinguishable obfuscation or sub

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,220
exponential security of LW

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,860
as a result the community also focused

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,040
on building Fe for specific class of

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
functions for example linear quadratic

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,740
functions and their variants these

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,340
constructions are efficient and fully

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,860
Collision resistant the security is

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,680
based on standard assumptions like ddh

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,479
scalene or LW

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,060
these schemes can also be deployed in

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,439
practice

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,259
this word focuses on building a fee for

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,619
a specific class of functions namely

48
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,780
attribute weighted sums or AWS

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,719
introduced by Abdullah gong and we here

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,479
secret keys are generated for functions

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,840
which take input a vector of length name

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,780
and outputs a vector of length n

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,560
the message is a tuple of x and z where

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,340
X is public and XZ is private the

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,080
functionality outputs the inner product

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,379
between the vectors f of x and z

57
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,200
prior Works build the Primitive for

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,780
function class ABP or arithmetic

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,040
branching program

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
the master public key depends on the

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
lens of x and z the cyphatic size

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,420
depends on the length of C although the

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,160
first work of up the light all

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,260
considered only semi-adaptive security

65
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,480
last year we achieved adaptive

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
simulation security

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,900
the functionality also has several

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,840
applications for example it captures

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,620
existing Fe schemes such as ipfe ape a b

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,000
ipfe

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
however the current structure of AWS has

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,340
many limitations it only considers

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,160
non-uniform or non-dynamic model the

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,860
setup is bounded the ciphertext size is

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,440
not input specific and it captures only

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
bounded Fe schemes

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,180
let's see how to remove all the

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,060
limitations one by one firstly we can

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,340
consider uniform model of computation

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,580
such as TuneIn machines setup could be

81
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,720
made unbounded that is mpk only depends

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,180
on security parameter the Cyber text

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,840
size is input specific we also hope to

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,480
have adaptive simulation security

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,420
this is exactly the motivation of our

86
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,940
work due to all these positive features

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,739
the functionality also captures

88
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,400
unbounded Fe schemes such as unbounded

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,340
ipfe or unbounded ape

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,940
in summary we Define Fe for unbounded

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,540
AWS and construct it for log space to

92
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,840
win machines our scheme enjoys exciting

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,540
properties like dynamism meaning that

94
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,000
attributes can be added or deleted at

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
any point of time the Cyber text is

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,860
compact meaning that it does not grow

97
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,780
with the multiple occurrence of a

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,399
particular attribute in the weight

99
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,040
function our scheme is fully Collision

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,199
resistant and adaptively simulation

101
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,080
secured under the oil studied sxds

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,220
assumption

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,680
