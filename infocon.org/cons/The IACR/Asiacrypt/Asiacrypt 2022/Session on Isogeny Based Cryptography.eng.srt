1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,360
i j and k where I squared is equal to H

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,319
squared is equal to B and K is I times J

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,840
an order in that case is a zeratifah of

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
Rank 4 that is also a ring

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,420
so it has an additional structure it is

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,520
maximal when not contained in another

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
order so it is kind of at the top of

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,039
this kind of hierarchy you can give by

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,460
inclusion and all those are rings this

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,800
means that we can also have ideals of

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,019
those orders and in this non-commutative

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,058
setting

13
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,500
ideals have distinct left and right

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
orders and this means that we are going

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,460
to be able to build this kind of graph

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,320
structure on top of the question in

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
algebra by considering nodes as orders

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,040
and then edges as ideals okay and the

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,500
daring correspondence basically tells me

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,360
that these two families of graphs that

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
I'm just explained to you well they're

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,899
related to one another if I take P the

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,059
prime characteristic and then then there

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,340
exists some integer queue which depends

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,500
only on P such that for the quantum

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,740
algebra B minus Q minus P then my two

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,140
graphs are basically the same so for

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,760
every isomorphism class of super

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,040
singular curve I have a corresponding

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,200
osmorphism class of maximal order inside

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,020
my B minus Q minus p and this is

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,700
actually given by the endomorphism ring

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,860
so this is quite explicit and of course

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,600
this is a two-way street so the convert

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,880
is also true for each maximum order I

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
have a corresponding curve so this is

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
for the notes of My Graph then I can do

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,979
the same for the edges which are

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,380
Journeys and ideals and in both cases

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,119
the degree and the norm of the ideals

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,380
agree

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,420
a quick example when I take P equal to

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,640
three month four then I can have q equal

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,759
1. and then this curve e0 is super

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,479
singular and here is a basis a very nice

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,939
basis of its onomorphism ring generated

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,640
by two onomorphisms pi and Yeta whose

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,619
expression you can see are very simple

49
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,740
as rational Maps and then you have the

50
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,240
correspondence with the elements over

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,119
the quatening algebra

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,500
so it works quite well

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,739
okay

54
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,560
okay so the the goal the original goal

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,879
of the study of the daring

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,400
correspondence is was actually crypto

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
analysis okay we wanted to understand a

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,060
little bit better the isogenic problem

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,640
and how it could uh relate to some

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,099
problems over the quaternion algebra so

61
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,620
in the end we did not end up by breaking

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,720
those problems but with a bunch of nice

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,780
algorithmic tools basically that allowed

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,819
me to do the conversion from elements

65
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,879
over the question algebra side toward

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,519
elliptic curves and isogenes so for

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,260
instance if I have a maximal order I can

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,019
compute the the corresponding curve the

69
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,780
same for ideals and isogenes and I have

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,180
also some nice features such as finding

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,459
exogenes between between curves of known

72
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,819
on the moves and ranks so this is a

73
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,099
bunch of nice tools which has already

74
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,800
been used constructively for signatures

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,140
so first it was the GPS signatures and

76
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,500
more recently ski sign and both really

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
heavily are based on those nice

78
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,580
algorithms based on on the daring

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,860
correspondence and and the goal of this

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,440
paper was kind of exploring the new

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,959
possibilities offers so pushing a little

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,640
bit the limits of what we know how to do

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,260
with those with those tools

84
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,120
and to understand how how we achieved

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
that I think we need to talk a little

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,080
bit about isogeny representations

87
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,700
so

88
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,980
um so if I go back to the definition of

89
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,200
an isogony okay this is really like

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,720
between two curves E1 and E2 as I said

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,879
to you these are rational Maps so I can

92
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,420
give defining polynomials uh F1 F2 G1

93
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,239
and G2 which are going to basically

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,180
Define my assertion and by and I such a

95
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,239
new representation I say this is

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
basically a string for which there

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
exists two algorithms first a

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
verification algorithms that is going to

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,340
assess basically the validity in some

100
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,000
sense of my representation for a given

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
domain co-domain and degree and then an

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
evaluate algorithms that is going to

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,439
take the representation a point and

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,959
compute the image of the point through

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,540
my I substance

106
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
going back to the definition it's quite

107
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,600
uh natural to to define a representation

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,440
as the four polynomials F1 F2 G1 and G2

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,979
which are used to define my isagen

110
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,160
and

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Factor my Exogen into into small yeah

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,780
most of the time I'm going to be stuck

113
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,400
with small degrees

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,460
then we have the kernel representation

115
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,740
and this is given as one generator of

116
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,080
the kernel and actually thanks to the

117
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,780
value formulas I can use this kernel

118
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,900
generator to compute my my polynomials

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,320
okay and this uh representation has the

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,900
advantage of being quite Compact and

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,699
also when the degree Smooths then I can

122
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,580
apply efficiently the value formulas and

123
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,639
by nice I mean that the degree means

124
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,620
must be smooth and such that the torsion

125
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,419
points are defined over a small

126
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,259
extension uh and you can ensure that by

127
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,520
choosing carefully the prime

128
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,220
characteristic so this can always be

129
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,080
used and on and this is what is most

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,660
often used in such an embed cryptography

131
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,240
nonetheless the complexity is basically

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,820
polynomial in D actually polymer in the

133
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,560
biggest prime factor of D but uh in in

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,180
general this is equivalent because I can

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,220
have a prime degree okay so this means

136
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
that it is not adapted to handle

137
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,900
isagenes of arbitrary decrease

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,720
and for that case we actually has well

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
all the necessary tools with the diving

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,820
correspondence okay and this is where I

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,740
Define the ideal representation which is

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,960
basically the ideal Associated through

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,060
the Darwin correspondence to my isagen

144
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,820
so I can represent that through 16

145
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,400
coefficients over Z that will give me a

146
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,759
basis uh in the quatson and algebra of

147
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,199
my ideal

148
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,600
and then thanks to the nice algorithms

149
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,699
that we we discovered studying the

150
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,680
daring correspondence we actually can

151
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,479
show that this representation is both

152
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
Compact and efficient for any degree D

153
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
and Prime p and this means that we have

154
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,139
complexities and sizes which are

155
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,199
polynomial in log p and log d

156
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,660
so quite nice

157
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,180
uh however it's almost too good in the

158
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,979
sense that it reveals every information

159
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,100
there is to know about the exogeny and

160
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,039
also the two curves E1 and E2 so this

161
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,440
means that we can use that as a secret

162
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,900
but we cannot hope to reveal this ideal

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,660
representation and I hope to hide

164
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,419
something from an adversary okay so for

165
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,280
cryptography we would like to have

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,740
something that would stand like in the

167
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,199
middle okay and this is the goal of the

168
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,220
support representation

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,500
okay

170
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,800
so did you see where these come from I

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,020
need to talk a little bit about what we

172
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,840
call lollipop on the morphism so this is

173
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,120
the idea that if there is an isogen E5

174
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
between E1 and E2 then I can be I can

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,300
build on the morphisms of E2 by uh

176
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,340
construct by looking at this lollipop on

177
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,880
demorphisms that I get by uh composing

178
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,060
Phi and its dual with onomorphisms of E1

179
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,560
okay and as you can see in the picture

180
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,599
it gives you some kind of Lollipop so

181
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,360
this is where the name come from and if

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,099
I consider all those lollipop and

183
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,039
morphisms I get a full order inside the

184
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,319
andamorphism ring of E2 which is

185
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,900
actually isomorphic to this Z plus d

186
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,880
times on the morphism range of E1 okay

187
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,000
so in some sense I get an embedding of

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,280
this suborder inside the endomorphous

189
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
ring

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
and uh conversely actually the existence

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,460
of this embedding proves that there is

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,860
there must be an isotony five between E1

193
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,740
and D2 of equity so there is uh there

194
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,900
are small additional conditions but

195
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,419
overall the idea is that really the

196
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,860
existence of this embedding is

197
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,780
equivalent to the existence of an

198
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,979
isogeny

199
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,660
so this is quite nice and this is the

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,639
basis for the support representation

201
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,500
which is concretely made of the

202
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,360
following information so first you have

203
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,580
the degree and the two curves domain in

204
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,919
codomain then we have the endomorphism

205
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,260
ring of E1 so given as 16 coefficients

206
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,219
in Z to to give a basis

207
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,800
then uh and finally I have these three

208
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,279
S1 S2 and S3 which are uh Canada

209
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,760
representations of onomorphisms of E2

210
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,459
and of course we choose those such such

211
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,820
that the this embedding of the lollipop

212
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,519
order is generated by those onomorphisms

213
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,300
okay so it's not completely clear uh and

214
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,580
easy to see that uh

215
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,040
how many of those we would need and so

216
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
on but actually uh yeah three is is

217
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,620
actually enough and we can choose those

218
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,080
to get everything uh working in

219
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,720
polynomial time so this is where most of

220
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
the technical details are hidden and in

221
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,700
the paper we have to develop a bunch of

222
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,100
new algorithmic tools to handle all

223
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,760
those operations uh efficiently

224
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,160
uh but it can be done I'm not going to

225
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,600
talk about that because it's too

226
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,820
technical but I invite you to look at

227
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,320
the the concrete

228
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,600
paper if you you're curious about that

229
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,519
but the bottom line is that we can

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,620
derive polynomial time algorithms for

231
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,160
arbitrary degree for verify evaluate and

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,440
even for computing this about the

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,580
representation from

234
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,100
the idea

235
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,040
so everything can be done efficiently

236
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,800
instead for now what I present to you

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,240
today it's mostly Theory

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,220
critical uh and it's not very practical

239
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,959
we'll give some improvements about that

240
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,700
but at least we have the polynomial time

241
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,140
things which is already a good step

242
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,080
toward something efficient

243
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,839
so now let's go back to cryptography

244
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,940
our original motivation was to have

245
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,380
something which was not completely

246
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,420
equivalent to the ideal representation

247
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,720
okay so in fact as I said to you the the

248
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,580
conversion from ideal representation to

249
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,920
sub order representation is easy and

250
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,540
that's a good thing because otherwise we

251
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,220
wouldn't be able to

252
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,320
to generate a support representation

253
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,420
because this as as you saw this is not

254
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,640
something completely trivial to build

255
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,000
okay but what is important to us is that

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,740
the other problem the rigorous problem

257
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,839
of computing the ideal representation

258
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,399
from the subordinary representation

259
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,940
which I call the soap for suborder to

260
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,200
Ideal problem is hard okay and well

261
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,500
uh it's not completely clear due to the

262
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,060
recent attacks I'm going to talk to

263
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,399
about that a little bit at the end of

264
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,620
the talk but at least for now this

265
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,320
problem is not is not completely broken

266
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,600
we have actually some related problems

267
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
the sub order representation to ondom of

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,700
pheasuring problem okay whose goal is to

269
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,779
complete the on the month is remaining

270
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,480
of the code domain so we we reveal some

271
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,820
onomorphisms of the codomain by

272
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,079
definition of or some other

273
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,380
representation but not all okay this is

274
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,779
the important part uh and actually those

275
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,480
are chosen very carefully so that we do

276
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,060
not reveal the full on demorphism

277
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,760
and actually it does do not appear very

278
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,220
easy to to compute the anomalism Ring of

279
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,260
the co-domain as well and then we have a

280
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,360
version of the isogeny problem with

281
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,339
torsion information and we want to know

282
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,820
if providing some torsion information on

283
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,180
the uh the isotony can allow you to

284
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,459
compute the ideal representation

285
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,180
and in fact uh I show in the paper that

286
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,500
all those problems are basically

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,079
equivalent to one another okay so there

288
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,940
are basically the same and the best

289
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,920
known attack is quantums of exponential

290
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,579
in D and we have such an attack because

291
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,680
we reveal some onomorphisms which are

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
already a lot of information so uh from

293
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,720
uh exponential attack in the generic

294
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,940
isotonin program we get down to quantums

295
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,000
of exponential but it's still uh quite

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,540
hard and uh yeah because basically yeah

297
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,459
we reveal some of the morphisms but they

298
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,720
do not give the full on the morphism

299
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,959
rate so this is not enough information

300
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,540
and from that we build a key exchange

301
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,200
based on similar similar idea to sidh

302
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,060
okay and the idea is really to use the

303
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,980
gap between ideal and suborder

304
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,139
representation so my secrets are going

305
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,480
to be ideals and my public keys are

306
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,380
suborders okay and uh oh yeah something

307
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,880
that I should have mentioned earlier

308
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,700
this soap problem is actually only hard

309
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,760
when the degree is a big Prime okay if

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,320
if it is smooth then everything

311
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,660
basically collapses to something that is

312
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,000
quite easy but when it is a big Prime

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
this is where things get hard and yeah

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,820
we do not have efficient algorithms so

315
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,680
in that case when the degree of the two

316
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
on isagen is Phi n and Phi B of Alice

317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,380
and Bob are coprime with one another I

318
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,420
can build the following commutative

319
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,760
diagram which is the same diagram that

320
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,100
is used for sidh the difference is that

321
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
in sidh it was for smooth degrees

322
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,500
but the diagram Remains the Same in

323
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,200
essence and thanks to our new algorithms

324
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,540
to evaluate from the suborder

325
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,339
representation we can actually complete

326
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,459
this diagram and so Alison Bob can

327
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,380
actually end up with the two with these

328
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,600
two curves EAB and EBA which are

329
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
isomorphic to one another and this is

330
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
where the command Secrets come from in

331
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,720
the key exchange

332
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
and actually despite the fact that the

333
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,100
idea is quite actually the picture is

334
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,779
similar to sidh the profile is much more

335
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,820
similar to Seaside because first we have

336
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,160
a Quantum sub-exponential attack and

337
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,740
second since we have a verify algorithm

338
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,320
for our suborder representation the

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,360
public keys are verifiable and this

340
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,220
means that P side is actually a

341
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,079
non-interactive key exchange because we

342
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,200
can verify public keys so this is a nice

343
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,579
feature

344
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,100
and this is where p-side is actually

345
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,519
closer to Seaside in some sense but of

346
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,800
course those two are not equivalent to

347
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,440
another so in practice as I said p-side

348
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,480
rather theoretical so it's not going to

349
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,959
be able to compete with Seaside at least

350
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,940
for now but the structure the

351
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,260
mathematical structure is quite

352
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,180
different and the hard problem is also

353
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,699
different so hopefully

354
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,279
um we get something something which

355
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,500
could have some different applications

356
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,360
and so I'm just going to conclude by

357
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,860
saying that first isotony-based

358
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,199
cryptography is not dead uh it is still

359
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,560
an exciting time to work on isogenes and

360
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
the daring correspondence and we just

361
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,100
have introduced some new ideas to build

362
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,500
cryptography so it is time to to work on

363
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,560
those and see where this will lead us

364
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,399
and I just don't

365
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,680
want to briefly very briefly conclude

366
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,660
by talking a little bit about the impact

367
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,420
as I said in the chronology uh I

368
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,699
proposed the scheme before the

369
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,760
the attacks were published so um right

370
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,740
now thanks to this big Prime degree we

371
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,839
cannot really apply those attacks but I

372
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,579
think uh there are there is a real

373
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,500
threat and I wouldn't be completely

374
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,660
surprised that uh tweaks and and

375
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,399
variants of the attacks can be used to

376
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,779
maybe lower the security or even

377
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,579
directly attack the protocol so this

378
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,440
this is really a problem that needs more

379
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,519
study

380
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,779
uh in the event uh where the scheme is

381
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,160
not actually broken I think the new

382
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,139
attacks are also a new opportunity

383
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,500
recently Damian Robert showed that the

384
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,420
objects used in the attacks can also

385
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,820
actually be used to represent isogenes

386
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,680
and I think uh actually this gives

387
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,480
something which is quite equivalent to

388
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,880
the suborder representation and I think

389
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,339
it would be more efficient so yeah if if

390
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,500
the attacks do not break P side maybe

391
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,220
they can make it stronger so yeah just

392
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,899
to say that there is still a lot of work

393
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,199
to do but things uh can be can get quite

394
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,839
exciting so we will see thank you very

395
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,060
much for listening uh I invite you to

396
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,440
look at the imprint for all the

397
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,420
technical details and I'll try to answer

398
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,420
a few questions maybe if the sound come

399
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,380
back I don't know

400
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,300
[Music]

401
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,860
um

402
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,899
so yes sorry I'll I'll try just a few

403
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,959
to see if I can change the building or

404
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,519
wherever you can maybe that's for me

405
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,740
hearing anything

406
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,820
okay

407
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,259
um I'm afraid that we don't really have

408
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,899
time for questions I'm sorry about that

409
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,199
um maybe just send an email to antenna

410
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,319
if you have any questions and uh that I

411
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,939
guess means we should move on to the

412
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,280
next speakers the next speaker here

413
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,579
please just come on okay okay I'm not

414
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,799
hearing anything

415
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,740
okay we'll deal with that oh no times

416
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,299
for questions okay

417
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,640
sorry if I if I was a little bit too

418
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,819
long

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,540
okay

420
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,020
so that means we're ready to have the

421
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,700
next talk of this session on a

422
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,039
surgeon-based cryptography uh the

423
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,919
speaker here is Julian Newman and this

424
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,620
is Joint work together with a long list

425
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
of authors Dominic Hartmann

426
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,600
Consuela Jonas lemon and Doreen Ripple

427
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,760
and you said to speak to us about the

428
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,980
group action key encapsulation and

429
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,720
non-interactive key exchange in the

430
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,620
queue ROM

431
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,520
so please

432
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,640
hello okay works great

433
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
okay I'm

434
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm Julian and I'm going to talk about

435
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,880
the group action key encapsulation at

436
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
non-adactive key exchange and the

437
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,340
quantum random molecular model

438
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,020
yeah this is a joint work as mentioned

439
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,559
um okay so non-detective key exchange

440
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,780
we have Alice and Bob

441
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,080
and there are somehow uh exchanged

442
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,020
public keys but besides exchanging the

443
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,640
public keys

444
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,340
the some point of time they can compute

445
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,640
a shared key without any interaction

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
so here in the uh if you have a key

447
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,600
exchange it's a g to the AP

448
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,260
and as you might know this key exchange

449
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,000
is specifically secure under the

450
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,419
decisional if you have an assumption

451
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,360
which states that given G to the a g to

452
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,640
the B and G to the A B that this is

453
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,919
computationally indistinguishable from G

454
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,620
to the a g to the B and G to the U

455
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,500
for a b and uh uniformly random from set

456
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,299
B where p is the prime order of the

457
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,418
group

458
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,400
and now there's a slight variation of

459
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,640
the VMR key exchange called hash dvr1

460
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,820
where the G to the a b g to the a b is

461
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,559
additionally hashed

462
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,240
and in this talk on our work we also

463
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,299
have the public Keys additionally hashed

464
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,299
and interestingly this variant of the

465
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,280
scheme is actively secure under the

466
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,160
strong computational DVM and assumption

467
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,960
in the random article model

468
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,260
so what does the Assumption state

469
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,480
the Assumption states that it is

470
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,140
difficult to compute G to the a b given

471
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,340
G to the A and G to the B and an Oracle

472
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,780
which decides whether

473
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,720
the first input given exponentiated by a

474
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,880
equals G2

475
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,360
so this is a variant of the so this is a

476
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,059
dth article uh

477
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,340
and

478
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,280
now in the quantum world uh the thing is

479
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,799
that of course the classical defi MRT

480
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,460
exchange is not secure anymore

481
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,220
so we have to look at other

482
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,320
possibilities and for letters and codes

483
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,179
it's an open research question to put

484
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,539
Nike but from

485
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,360
surgery-based cryptography like Seaside

486
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
we have a candidate for Quantum

487
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,160
resistant Nike

488
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,320
and in our work we use the group action

489
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,620
based abstraction so we're not going to

490
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,299
look at any misogyny details

491
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,880
so what's the cryptographic compaction

492
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,960
we have a group we have a set X and a

493
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,980
map mapping from G and X to X

494
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,860
which is called the group action and we

495
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,539
have some additional properties that you

496
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,100
might know

497
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,120
um

498
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,059
in particular given two group elements G

499
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,260
and H

500
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,299
if you first multiply them and then act

501
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,240
on X then this is the same as first

502
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,659
taking Edge H acting on X and then

503
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,260
taking G and acting on that element

504
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,760
and there are some additional

505
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,039
assumptions that we make like that GA

506
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,620
index are finite and that the group is a

507
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,760
billion

508
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,440
and regularity which states that two set

509
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
elements X1 and X2

510
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,440
that there exists in unique Gene which

511
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,820
with uh G acting on X1 equals X2

512
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,080
internet distinguished element X tilde

513
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,020
which we call the origin

514
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,880
um so the quantum render molecular model

515
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
we have to talk about that so that we

516
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,480
can

517
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,140
continue we have the thing is if we want

518
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,480
to study Quantum resistance schemes and

519
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,539
we are on the random Oracle model then

520
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,159
um we have to consider the fact that the

521
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,780
quantum computer can make superposition

522
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,940
queries

523
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,400
and

524
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,120
so to model that uh the extent uh extend

525
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
the random Oracle to be Quantum

526
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,880
accessible

527
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,440
and this is called the quantum random

528
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,860
molecular model

529
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,900
um yeah

530
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,820
so I've been tossed about that we can

531
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,880
now look at the Nike or hdp Airman

532
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,200
equivalent in the group action setting

533
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,360
so here we have uh kind of the same

534
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,059
thing as a classic case

535
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,980
but uh

536
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,220
we have the group action that we use

537
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,559
so what was before key to the AP is now

538
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,740
here A B operating or acting on on the

539
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,240
origin

540
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,299
and what we do in our work is uh

541
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,179
we study when the scheme is secure

542
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,880
and we prove that

543
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,860
we need a Quantum accessible version of

544
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,100
the strong CDH assumption

545
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,419
to prove uh we need to show that or we

546
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,620
show that

547
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,360
it's necessary to have a Quantum

548
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,039
accessible version of the strong CDH

549
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,299
assumption

550
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,240
for active Security in the Q ROM we give

551
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,720
a proof on such an assumption

552
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,059
and then what we do is we give

553
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,340
constructions with weaker assumptions

554
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,140
and also prove the security of the

555
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,220
corresponding caps

556
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,340
and in particular we give the first

557
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,679
construction and proof of a Nike from

558
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,260
the group action CDH assumption

559
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,559
with active Security in the queue run

560
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,100
foreign

561
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,840
capsulation variant because the proof

562
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,299
is a little bit simpler and

563
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,720
the CCA security of the chem is kind of

564
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,460
similar to the access security of the

565
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,419
Nike

566
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,280
and here we have the group action scheme

567
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,020
so there's one

568
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,000
but the thing that we need to prosecute

569
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,679
in the Quran that's just one way to

570
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,419
hiding Lemma

571
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,299
and the classical ROM when there's an

572
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,760
element X star if the adversary doesn't

573
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
carry that element then h of X star is

574
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,799
going to look random

575
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,840
and in the Q ROM

576
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,820
you can make a single superposition

577
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,640
query and then you have basically create

578
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,740
every element so that same argument

579
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,200
doesn't hold like that

580
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,480
but the one way to hiding Lemma I lost

581
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,440
to reprogram values of the random Oracle

582
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
because basically

583
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,200
the intuition is there is that

584
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,299
on adversary to notice the reprogramming

585
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,919
then it needs to be enough weight on

586
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,419
x-star

587
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,400
and if the weight is noticeable then

588
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
measuring just a random query will give

589
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,580
effect star with a noticeable

590
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,500
probability

591
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,419
indexes several improved variants of the

592
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,980
clemma so I'm not going to talk about

593
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,279
that

594
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,799
so let's now talk about the assumptions

595
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,179
so the group action strong CDH

596
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,380
assumption

597
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,460
states that given G Star origin and H is

598
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,620
our origin it's difficult to compute GH

599
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,080
origin

600
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,059
and

601
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,919
additionally given access to a decision

602
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,059
Oracle

603
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,220
where we have the same equivalent as in

604
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,059
the classical strong CDH case only that

605
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,919
now group actions

606
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,480
so the EDH Oracle here

607
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,240
decides whether X1 of G acting on this

608
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,020
one is equal to X2

609
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,940
and there's now the fully Quantum

610
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,820
version where the adversary has a

611
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,039
Quantum access to both inputs

612
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,919
this we call the group action fully

613
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,559
Quantum strong CDH assumption or a

614
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,480
problem

615
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
then there's a variant where the only

616
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,919
the second input is quantum accessible

617
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,140
and the first input is classical this we

618
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,880
call the partially Quantum strong CDH

619
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,860
assumption

620
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,620
then there's a variant where both inputs

621
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,539
are classical this is just group actions

622
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,220
from CGH assumption

623
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,500
then they have the

624
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,419
group action CDH assumption where

625
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,980
there's no Oracle access

626
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,980
okay so now let's uh go through the

627
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,279
proof idea why uh The partially Quantum

628
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,520
strong CDH assumption is necessary

629
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,580
so here we are

630
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,480
given an adversary against the partially

631
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,299
Quantum strong CDH assumption

632
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,100
here

633
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,860
and we are breaking the CCA uh security

634
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,140
of the chem so here we're giving the

635
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,940
public key of the chem of group action

636
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,320
hashtag gamma

637
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,980
the ciphertext and the chem key which is

638
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,820
either real or random

639
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,919
so we're going to plug in the public key

640
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,080
as the first input

641
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,779
and the ciphertext as a second input and

642
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,740
we are going to run this adversary which

643
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,080
uh

644
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,020
breaks the group action

645
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,520
partially Quantum strong CDH assumption

646
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,279
and we have to simulate to it the ddh

647
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,659
oracle

648
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,820
so this is basically the question to

649
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,659
answer

650
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,480
and once uh once we have the CDH

651
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,320
solution we can hash the CDH solution

652
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,760
compared to the chem key to decide

653
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,740
whether it's real or random

654
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,220
so how do we simulate the ddh oracle

655
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,760
so the idea here is that d-caps

656
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,500
evaluates to H X1 G operating on the X1

657
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,740
and these are valid uh

658
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,340
these are valid development Tuple

659
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,860
we can compare this to the input of the

660
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,559
dth Oracle X1 X2

661
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,260
and for the challenge we can create

662
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,940
decaps of the challenge as I have a text

663
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,340
so here we shifted by an element

664
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
G

665
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,880
iant but other than that it's been here

666
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,900
and so now uh the main observation

667
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,539
is that X1 is used in the decapsulation

668
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,679
oracle

669
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,600
and then this is the a game the

670
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,299
decapsulation Oracle is classical so X1

671
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,960
needs to be classical

672
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,779
but for X2 it's used here only in the in

673
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,059
the quantum random article

674
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,760
and so it can be Quantum so here we can

675
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,100
simulate a partially Quantum Oracle

676
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,059
so now let's go through the proof

677
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,860
of the actual security of group action

678
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,260
hashtag gamma

679
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,419
so the main question here is how to

680
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,640
simulate decapsulation

681
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,440
and for deep calculation what we are

682
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
going to do is we have for the random

683
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,799
Oracle X1 and X2 and we're going to

684
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,640
split it into two cases one for valid

685
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
dth uh tuples and one for invalid ones

686
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,700
for the valid ones we're going going to

687
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,880
get rid of the second input X2

688
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,200
because that's the value where the

689
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,260
secret key is used here

690
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,260
and once we have done that

691
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,379
um

692
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,860
we can just return H1 X1 in the

693
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
decapsulation

694
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,880
and this is then the correct simulation

695
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,000
of the decapsulation oracle

696
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,659
um

697
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,260
yeah

698
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,659
so the caveat here now the of the

699
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,419
observation is that the random Oracle is

700
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,520
quantum accessible and because of that

701
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,100
here the dgh Oracle also needs to be

702
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,960
Quantum accessible

703
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,279
so

704
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,120
um

705
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,760
this is where the the where where we

706
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,340
need the fully Quantum assumption

707
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,500
the proof security here and then after

708
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,600
how I showed how to simulate

709
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,279
decapsulation we just use one way to

710
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,140
hide and to reprogram the random Oracle

711
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,299
on the challenge input

712
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,600
so that's basically the proof

713
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,179
so the next question then is uh can we

714
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,700
do uh better can we use weaker

715
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,679
assumptions to prove security

716
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,039
with alternative constructions and the

717
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,100
first option is key confirmation hash

718
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,620
here we prove security from the group

719
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,779
actions from CDH assumption but

720
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,340
unfortunately this only works for the

721
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,520
cam

722
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,779
and the second option is that we

723
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,059
generalize twinning to group actions and

724
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,539
this works for both Nike and chem

725
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,539
uh and TV proof security from the group

726
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,158
action CDH assumption

727
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,310
so what is a key confirmation hash

728
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,559
[Music]

729
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,659
so here we have another random article H

730
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,100
Prime

731
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,620
and we're going to add this value to the

732
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,899
encapsulation C for ciphertext

733
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,600
and the idea here is that

734
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,240
since access to the decapsulation Oculus

735
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,580
classical the key conformation hash is

736
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,220
also going to be classical and

737
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,940
Texas techniques to extract a b of

738
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,679
acting on the origin from the key

739
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,299
confirmation hash

740
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,880
and once the simulator has done that it

741
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,520
can use the classical dth Oracle

742
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,940
to check for the validity of of this

743
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,580
element that it is about a ddh tuple

744
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,700
together with the server text and so we

745
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,799
only need therefore the group action

746
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,600
strong CDH assumption

747
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,580
as mentioned the caveat here that this

748
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,260
only works for the camp because now it's

749
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,740
Interactive

750
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,039
so what is training for the DVA key

751
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
exchange

752
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,260
there exists variants

753
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,600
where you double basically the key size

754
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,860
here

755
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,200
and you prepare every part from the

756
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,700
public key with every part here from the

757
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,080
secret key so G to the A1 B1 to up to G

758
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,899
to the A2 B2 and

759
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,539
here basically you can show security

760
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,360
from the CDH assumption active security

761
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,520
and the intuition here is that the

762
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,860
chapter test allows to simulate the

763
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,020
decision Oracle from the from the strong

764
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,520
CDH

765
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,520
assumption

766
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,460
um yeah what we do is that we

767
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,720
generalize this for the to the group

768
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,279
action setting

769
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,860
but unfortunately here the key sizes are

770
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,940
not doubled but uh M times the key size

771
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,799
where m is relatively large

772
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,480
and again we have to pair every part

773
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,340
here from the keys of every part from

774
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,000
the other key so here we have M squared

775
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
operations

776
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,480
so rather here theoretical Construction

777
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,580
but we prove access security from the

778
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,139
group action CDH assumption here

779
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:52,140
and this is basically it

780
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,980
um

781
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,179
yeah thank you

782
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,480
hello ah okay thanks for the nice talk

783
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
um turns out we have plenty of time for

784
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,899
questions so I didn't really have to cut

785
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,719
off antenna so much but well that's the

786
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,399
past does anybody want to ask a question

787
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,940
in the room

788
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,679
it doesn't appear so so I guess I can

789
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,239
ask a question that's maybe very dumb

790
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
but so on the previous slide you had the

791
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,219
m equals 85

792
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,219
um what how exactly does the the attack

793
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,800
look if you just don't use enough M here

794
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,879
like

795
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm kind of just wondering how does the

796
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
attacker approach this if you just

797
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,418
use not enough m

798
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,080
M that's a good question which I

799
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,879
can't answer because it was not by

800
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,980
Department

801
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,139
I was more on the other part I don't

802
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,440
know actually yeah

803
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,180
that's a good question I don't know

804
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,760
anybody else

805
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,619
I already embarrassed myself so now

806
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,020
maybe other people can stop being shy

807
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,500
and

808
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,660
okay I guess if not then uh and it also

809
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,099
appears there's nobody asking on Zoom I

810
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,320
guess we can just call it a day and oh

811
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
no wait we have one more talk but to

812
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,000
finish this talk so thanks again to

813
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Julian and thank you next speaker may

814
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,980
come up please

815
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:22,980
tested yeah while they're setting up all

816
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,619
the technology uh let me introduce the

817
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,359
next and final speaker of the session

818
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,359
Mark Cuban in and he's going to speak

819
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,359
about joint work with Thomas the crew

820
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,820
and Frederick all from Levin

821
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,339
about horizontal race walking using

822
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,859
radical isogenes so whenever you're

823
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,980
ready

824
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,320
okay thank you very much for the

825
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,820
introduction

826
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,099
so this topic that I'm going to talk

827
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,800
about radical isogenes

828
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,260
if you don't understand anything from my

829
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,260
talk maybe you can remember that this is

830
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,619
some method that you can use to speed up

831
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,339
isogeny based protocols

832
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:20,359
in particular the ones that are based on

833
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:23,460
Computing long chains of isogenes of a

834
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,280
small decree

835
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,640
such as what happens in a protocol

836
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,060
called Seaside which is an isogeny based

837
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,400
key exchange protocol

838
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,800
so we're already talking a lot about key

839
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,339
exchange today so I'll put everything in

840
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,740
this framework again

841
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,200
so there's roughly well there's exactly

842
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,260
two types of isogeny based key exchanges

843
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,480
so that's the ones that are based on

844
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,220
class group actions and the ones that

845
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,200
are not

846
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,300
So based on class group actions there's

847
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,160
CRS which is basically the OG of isotony

848
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,280
based cryptography

849
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,440
then also Seaside and generalizations

850
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,540
like oocyte

851
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,040
and then on the other side we have

852
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,339
basically only sidh and variance of that

853
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,520
and as far as I know these have all been

854
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,460
broken recently

855
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,500
so that's why I'm going to focus on the

856
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,880
left side of the slide and mainly on as

857
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,800
a main example which we had in the back

858
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,420
of our mind C site

859
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,119
and then yes okay I didn't forget about

860
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,940
continent stock from an hour ago so

861
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,220
there's also this thing called P site

862
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,740
uh and I don't know actually where to

863
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,420
put it in this picture so

864
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,820
you'd think on the right but there is

865
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,280
like an underlying group action

866
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,500
uh that once and I didn't talk about but

867
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,300
this is actually this yield system

868
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,700
exponential Quantum attack so

869
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm not sure maybe Anton I can answer

870
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,260
this at the end of my talk where he

871
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,020
thinks this should be

872
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,339
uh in any case so we're gonna focus on

873
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,740
this class group actions

874
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,060
and the idea is very simple so we have a

875
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,640
starting elliptic curve e0

876
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,820
and Alice and both have secret elements

877
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,060
of a certain ideal class group that acts

878
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,520
on elliptic curves

879
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,820
so they act on this curve e0 and then

880
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,140
they act on

881
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,319
what the other person got by doing this

882
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,880
and as long as a group action is

883
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,760
commutative which it is because class

884
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,500
groups are commutative

885
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,140
they end up at the same results which is

886
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,000
in their shared Secrets elliptic curve

887
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,200
so now the question is how do you do

888
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,660
this in practice so in practice how do

889
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,300
you

890
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,119
go from these magic ideal classes to

891
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,839
elliptic curves

892
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,180
and these ideal classes they induce Maps

893
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,099
between the curves so there's a map from

894
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,680
e0 to a e0

895
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,780
and this is called an isogeny that's why

896
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,599
it's called exogeny based cryptography

897
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,760
and what you essentially do is you break

898
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,780
this map up into smaller maps that are

899
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,640
easier to compute

900
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,800
so for Seaside the picture looks a bit

901
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,420
like this

902
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,820
so this is called an isogenic graph so

903
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,180
the vertices here are elliptic curves

904
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,920
and the edges are the maps between the

905
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,980
elliptic curve so the isogeneous and in

906
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,540
this picture the blue red and green

907
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,859
edges correspond to isogenesis degree

908
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,320
three five and seven

909
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,599
and so what Alice does when she wants to

910
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,800
compute

911
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,859
let's say her public key is she starts

912
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,920
at e0 which is some elliptic curve

913
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,560
uh then she does a couple of three

914
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,560
estrogenies and some point he stops you

915
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
get some elliptic curve

916
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,339
uh then she does a couple of five

917
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,880
exogenies a bunch of seven isogenies and

918
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,940
in the end she gets some elliptic curve

919
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,920
and as long as she doesn't tell anyone

920
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,260
how many isogenes of every degree she

921
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,520
used

922
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,440
it should be difficult to find the path

923
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,720
that she got

924
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,140
so that's basically the idea

925
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,560
so also to put this a bit into context

926
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,000
uh so Seaside I think it's a very nice

927
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,140
scheme

928
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,800
uh it's currently one of the most

929
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,359
promising post-con key exchange

930
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,900
protocols it is the most common key

931
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,400
exchange Proposal with the smallest key

932
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,780
sizes

933
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,880
uh the main disadvantage is that it's

934
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,640
relatively slow so

935
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,460
uh we don't really know an efficient way

936
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,940
to compute these isogeneous rocks

937
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,359
so essentially the problem is how do you

938
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,599
efficiently compute a chain of isogenes

939
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,079
of a small degree so that's essentially

940
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,940
uh what the research I'm talking about

941
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,579
today is about

942
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,980
so here's the problem

943
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,980
uh given an exogeny so let's say we have

944
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,099
already one step of our walk so we have

945
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,460
one isogony of a certain degree n

946
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,240
which is given by taking the quotient by

947
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,700
a cyclic subgroup so I have this point B

948
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,660
on E that has order n and now I want to

949
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,540
find the next step of the Walk which is

950
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,820
equivalent to finding a point P Prime

951
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,839
on the codomain such that when I take

952
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,560
the quotient by B Prime I get a cyclic

953
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,460
extension of my original estrogeny

954
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,420
so how do you find this P Prime thing

955
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,220
one way to do it is just to try random

956
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,319
points so you can sample random points

957
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,140
on E Prime and you can multiply by this

958
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,119
cofactor to the order of the group

959
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,119
divided by m and then you hope well

960
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,380
first of all that b Prime s order n

961
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,540
and also that it cyclically extends the

962
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,480
isogeny

963
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,180
and this is who I see site is slow so

964
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,680
this is what

965
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,420
they used essentially before radical

966
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,319
isogenes uh and the reason slows because

967
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,720
this multiplication by this large Vector

968
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,940
of Q

969
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,940
and also it's not deterministic like

970
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,099
this thing can fill so sometimes you

971
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,900
have to try another point

972
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,940
and that's also not super nice for a

973
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,079
certain applications like Constantine

974
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,200
so what are alternatives uh there's

975
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,060
something that's based on modular

976
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,619
polynomials

977
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,960
which is also

978
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,579
depending on implementation probably

979
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,460
also not deterministic and also not fast

980
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,400
so this is not super nice

981
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,119
and then another way is to construct

982
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,359
this point P Prime as the root of a

983
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,760
certain polynomial so this is called the

984
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,920
end division polynomial it has its roots

985
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,040
the coordinates of the N torsion points

986
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,200
so P Prime should be somewhere among

987
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,300
those roots

988
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,760
and this is essentially the idea that

989
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,819
leads to radical exogenies

990
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,819
but you don't extract the root every

991
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,040
time you essentially just find a formula

992
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,220
for the root that always works

993
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,260
so how do you find this formula I have

994
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,940
an example using five exogenies

995
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,240
so we had our assumption so we had one

996
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,000
step of disogyny walk so we had a point

997
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,500
p on E of order 5 in this case

998
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,060
and then it turns out that you can

999
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,520
always write your curve In This Very

1000
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,240
Special form where B is on parameter so

1001
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,280
if you put this point at the origin

1002
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,020
then you can write your curve like this

1003
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,380
this is called the date normal form

1004
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,480
uh and now this is cool because now what

1005
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,319
we're going to do is we're going to

1006
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,420
treat b as a variable and we're going to

1007
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,180
see what happens to the next curve in

1008
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,560
the in the isogeny walk

1009
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,020
so first we write down the equation for

1010
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,280
E Prime

1011
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,440
this is some equation you just take the

1012
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,000
quotient by P you get something in terms

1013
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,380
of B

1014
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,839
and then you want to find on this curve

1015
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,579
this point P Prime that we're talking

1016
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:33,660
about

1017
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,119
so you write down the five division

1018
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,700
polynomial it's some polynomial don't

1019
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,079
exactly matter what it is but it's

1020
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,720
something with this B again

1021
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,760
and then you get these coordinates

1022
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,140
so this is some expression in terms of B

1023
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,380
and alpha alpha is the fifth root of B

1024
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,880
and this is actually where the name

1025
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,300
radical isogeneous comes from because uh

1026
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,220
this is what's called a radical in

1027
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,839
mathematics

1028
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,380
uh uh and this point P Prime always

1029
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,440
turns out to give you a cyclic extension

1030
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,760
of uh of your original isogeny

1031
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,800
and now the last thing you can do is

1032
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,619
actually you can write this pair e Prime

1033
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:19,619
P Prime again in the state normal form

1034
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,420
so you can find

1035
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,359
the value of B Prime that's associated

1036
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:27,300
to this curve Point pair

1037
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,760
and this thing on the bottom right that

1038
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,339
is actually the radical isogeny formula

1039
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:33,960
so

1040
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,839
this thing you can iterate so this just

1041
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,460
gives you the B Prime of the next curve

1042
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,619
in the sequence and if you iterate that

1043
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,680
then that's the same thing as doing an

1044
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,520
exogeny walk

1045
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,980
uh okay so that's pretty cool and this

1046
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,800
is deterministic and it's also very fast

1047
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,760
much faster than sampling random points

1048
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,319
so now the question is can you do this

1049
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,319
for arbitrary degrees

1050
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,400
and the answer is theoretically yes so

1051
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,900
you can prove that the radical

1052
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,720
isogeneous formulas it always exists

1053
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,020
but if you want to find them this way

1054
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,900
then you're not gonna get super far so

1055
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,420
in the previous radical exogeny paper

1056
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,420
yeah

1057
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,940
the highest degree that we got was 13

1058
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,339
and this was using this method also

1059
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,960
compliant combined with additional

1060
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,700
tricks

1061
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,760
so what we did in in this paper

1062
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,300
essentially is to find a new method to

1063
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,660
find the formulas

1064
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,240
so in general uh the normal form looks a

1065
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,060
bit like this so there's two parameters

1066
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,920
instead of one

1067
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,560
so there's B and C and they satisfy some

1068
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,900
algebraic relation that states that the

1069
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,900
point that origin has order n

1070
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,599
uh and then the fancy way to say it is

1071
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,700
that this pair BC lies on the modular

1072
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,760
curve x1n

1073
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,920
and then the radical isogenic formulas

1074
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,980
so that's just a formula for B Prime and

1075
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,440
C Prime of the next curve

1076
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,720
in terms of B and C

1077
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,060
and there's this Alpha again which is

1078
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,819
now the nth root of something doesn't

1079
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,740
exactly matter what it is it's called

1080
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,859
the date and self-paring

1081
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,680
whatever it's some expression again in

1082
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,460
terms of B and C

1083
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,579
and now the idea is essentially we found

1084
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,560
a way to

1085
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,560
determine these coefficients of this

1086
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,960
formula

1087
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,040
explicitly by

1088
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,339
rational interpolation and for that idea

1089
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:48,960
is extremely simple so what you just do

1090
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,900
is you sample a lot of points a lot of

1091
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,440
pairs BC and then you look what the

1092
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,380
outcome of the formula should be

1093
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,380
and as long as you have enough samples

1094
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,660
then you can interpolate the function

1095
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,700
that belongs to this

1096
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,700
correspondence

1097
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:12,180
and you do this over a lot of small

1098
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,520
Fields FP and the reason I wrote

1099
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,339
smallish over there is because

1100
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:19,319
you still need to feel to be big enough

1101
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:22,319
for there to be enough samples in the

1102
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,819
first place

1103
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,220
so in practice we had primes of size

1104
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,819
about bit size 32 here

1105
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:32,579
and once you have enough of those then

1106
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:35,099
you can lift to character six zero using

1107
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:38,160
the Chinese remainder theorem

1108
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
uh okay

1109
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,460
[Music]

1110
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,339
using this you can extend the formulas

1111
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:45,900
up to

1112
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,140
degree 37.

1113
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,799
foreign

1114
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,220
so what's the next thing we did we also

1115
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,460
optimized the formula a little bit so we

1116
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,920
wrote them a little bit so I just have

1117
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,440
an example here

1118
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,920
so previously we had this thing

1119
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,760
which is the radical 8 isogeny formula

1120
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,319
uh and we rewrote it so this is just the

1121
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,819
same formula

1122
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,280
with a slightly different Alpha

1123
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,099
which is much nicer and we did this for

1124
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,200
all of the formulas that we already had

1125
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,119
and also for the new ones

1126
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,859
we just tried to rewrite them a little

1127
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,180
bit so that they're faster to evaluate

1128
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,040
and there's a lot of tricks to do that

1129
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,619
I'm not gonna go into all the details of

1130
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:38,579
that

1131
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,500
but in any case we got like compact

1132
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,300
forms of the formulas that we already

1133
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,099
had

1134
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,020
and then there's one more technical

1135
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,700
thing that we did

1136
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,260
so for even degree exogenes the isotony

1137
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,480
graph looks a little bit different

1138
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,940
so be before you had like the three five

1139
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,619
and seven

1140
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:02,099
uh and for that you always get a circle

1141
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,579
but for let's see two isogenes you also

1142
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,839
have some things going out of the circle

1143
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:11,520
and isogenes that go along the circle

1144
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,700
are chord horizontal exogenes and the

1145
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,260
ones that go out of the circle Accord

1146
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,940
vertical isogenes

1147
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,980
and when you do the radical isogeny

1148
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,260
formula thing

1149
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,660
then

1150
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,880
you have to compute this Alpha right and

1151
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,819
this Alpha is enter for two isogenes

1152
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,880
it's just a square root or something

1153
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,880
and what we did is basically we

1154
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,520
determined which of the square roots you

1155
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,099
have to take in order to

1156
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,380
do the horizontal isotune which is the

1157
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,480
one you want to have

1158
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,420
we have a conjecture

1159
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,520
for all even degrees

1160
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,319
which one you should take which is a

1161
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,319
non-trivial conjecture which you proved

1162
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,599
up to degree 14.

1163
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:01,640
next

1164
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,700
okay here are the benchmarks so if you

1165
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,500
combine all of this

1166
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,780
then asymptotically you get Vector 4

1167
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,839
improvement for change of two isogenies

1168
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,839
uh practically we got factors three over

1169
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,020
512 bits Prime fields

1170
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:22,500
and we also gained 12 percent over the

1171
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,020
previous implementation of Seaside using

1172
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,599
vertical isogenes

1173
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,619
okay thanks

1174
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,000
thanks for the again fairly short talk

1175
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,339
so again sorry to Antonov for cutting

1176
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,319
you off so quickly

1177
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:44,700
um does anybody in the room want to ask

1178
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,319
a question yes

1179
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,579
I can sure

1180
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
thank you thank you for the nice talk uh

1181
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,520
I have a question so you said that you

1182
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,280
extended the the formulas for the

1183
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,700
radical isoton is up to n equal to 37.

1184
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,880
uh in C surf uh you need uh isotenuse

1185
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,619
with a larger degree

1186
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,300
so how do you manage

1187
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,480
so for the larger degrees you use older

1188
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,920
different methods

1189
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,780
so the methods that already existed for

1190
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,660
larger degrees use there and effects so

1191
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,099
there's kind of a trade-off so the

1192
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,079
radical isogenic formulas

1193
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,859
once you have them they're always

1194
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:31,140
asymptotically better than all of the

1195
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,240
other methods As We Know

1196
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,300
but at some point they get really really

1197
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,520
complicated so I already showed you like

1198
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,660
this

1199
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,940
one for eight is already quite ugly when

1200
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,780
you get this the degree 37 then you

1201
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,079
already have megabytes of equations

1202
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,200
and then in practice it's not

1203
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,440
it's not useful anymore so I think right

1204
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,859
now we go up to degree

1205
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,960
19. we use them up to degree 19 and then

1206
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,119
the ones that we have higher than that

1207
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,200
for 512 bits they're not even useful so

1208
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,599
there we just use the old methods

1209
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,140
to to walk along the exogenic graph

1210
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,099
right but then then I I I have the

1211
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:20,880
question how can you get this amazing uh

1212
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,300
acceleration factor of three times uh

1213
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,740
because

1214
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:31,079
um so one thing you can do is to use

1215
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,839
more isogenes or smaller degree

1216
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,640
so you can get

1217
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,140
similar key Spaces by using let's say

1218
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,460
200 isogenes of degree 2 but only one or

1219
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,960
two of degree I don't know 47. so you

1220
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,000
kind of skew the box out of which you

1221
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,579
sample your keys

1222
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,400
and then the radicalized needs to become

1223
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,440
more important

1224
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,079
okay and have you compared with other

1225
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,839
implementations besides C serve like sit

1226
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,760
tight or so

1227
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,800
this is the one we compared it to

1228
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,599
because this was the one that we used

1229
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,099
before for radical isogenes and we

1230
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,420
wanted to compare the Improvement we had

1231
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,059
for the radical certainly part but right

1232
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,859
now I don't think there even exists like

1233
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,839
a state-of-the-art implementation of

1234
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:19,920
Seaside

1235
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,500
that uses all of the tricks in the book

1236
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,059
but if there would be then would be nice

1237
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,520
to see what percentage you gain over

1238
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,740
that why do you say that there have been

1239
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,140
several Works trying to improve as much

1240
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,819
as possible as the site yeah yeah of

1241
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:35,339
course but there's nothing I think right

1242
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:36,839
now but you can correct me I would be

1243
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,240
happy to know yeah that uses all of the

1244
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,859
tricks including the ones in this paper

1245
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,900
okay maybe later we can yeah that would

1246
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,200
be that would be thank you very much

1247
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,240
okay anybody else

1248
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,078
more questions

1249
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,040
uh I I can ask a question I guess so

1250
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,200
uh you said that the formulas are really

1251
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,579
really big for

1252
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,619
degrees that are greater than 19 or

1253
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:03,900
something is that you think because

1254
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,000
they're they intrinsically have to be

1255
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,220
that big or because you just didn't like

1256
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,020
find the correct optimizations to write

1257
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,700
them in a nicer way yet

1258
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,220
so intrinsically I think they should

1259
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,540
grow

1260
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,700
uh I don't know if any mathematical

1261
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,500
explanation well okay so one

1262
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,500
mathematical explanation is that

1263
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:22,660
um

1264
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,720
[Music]

1265
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,859
um okay so this is a little bit

1266
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:28,319
technical but maybe I can

1267
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,119
explain with this example of the tape

1268
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,400
normal form so

1269
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,260
so you have this pair BC and it

1270
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,180
satisfies certain equation so

1271
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,280
essentially the coefficient of the

1272
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,140
radicalized formulas are going to be

1273
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,900
elements of the function field of this

1274
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,920
curve

1275
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,319
but this curve has a certain gonality

1276
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,240
which is the degree of the smallest map

1277
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,300
to P1 and you cannot hope for formulas

1278
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,920
that have degrees smaller than that

1279
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,480
already

1280
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,700
so that already gives you

1281
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,200
at least

1282
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,280
yeah increasing formulas let's say uh

1283
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,920
then yeah sure I'm sure that there's

1284
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,480
better ways to optimize them that we

1285
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,859
haven't found

1286
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,680
but yeah I I honestly don't know the

1287
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,619
range of due when they will ever be

1288
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,460
useful

1289
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,260
so potential for improvement if anybody

1290
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,280
wants to

1291
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,280
look for possible ways

1292
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,280
uh I guess there's no more questions so

1293
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,440
correct me if I'm wrong

1294
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,359
also nothing on Zoom so let's thank the

1295
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,800
speaker again and thanks to all speakers

1296
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,400
in this session

1297
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,040
and next up is a five minute track

1298
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,780
switch break which we've extended to

1299
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,520
about 10 minutes so you have extra time

1300
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,660
to maybe grab a coffee if there's still
