1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,319
this is the short condition for our

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,919
paper an analysis of the algebraic group

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,760
model

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,700
my name is hunchinju and this is China

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,280
work with Jonathan Katz and sundra

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,279
group based cryptography received a lot

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,420
of attention

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,699
since the famous result by Divina

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,720
Hermann

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,960
security of cryptographic scheme can be

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,660
based on Khan's assumption relative to a

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,560
group

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,980
we must know that these assumptions are

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,320
already related to some concluding

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,420
coding of the group elements

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,760
in Koreans matter

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,660
unfortunately

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,040
we do not know how to prove any

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,379
unconditional hardness result relative

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,960
to any concrete

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,660
group encoding

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,199
thus researchers start to consider

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,800
restrict class of algorithms

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,319
generic algorithm and the general group

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,720
model were introduced

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,960
in the general group model we can prove

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,640
unconditional hardness results

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,760
later algebraic algorithm and the

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,759
algebra group model were introduced

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,439
in the 2000 in 2018 paper among many

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,780
results the orders claim that

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,960
a generic reduction between two problems

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,259
in the algebra group model implies a

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,140
generic reduction between these problems

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,700
in the general Guru model

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,500
in our paper we show account example

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,540
to the claim in the 2018 paper

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,700
and the count example is called a binary

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,720
encoding game

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,299
more issues of the algebra group model

41
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,680
can be found in our paper
