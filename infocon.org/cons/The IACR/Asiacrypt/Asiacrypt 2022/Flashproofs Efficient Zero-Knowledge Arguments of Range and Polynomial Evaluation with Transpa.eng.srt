00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,140
hi everyone this is Nan Wang from the

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,420
Australian National University

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,179
we are going to present our paper flash

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,340
proofs efficient zero knowledge

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,320
arguments of range and polynomial

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,379
evaluation on the 6th December in Asia

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,740
Crypt 2022

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,619
flashproofs are three round Sigma

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,740
protocols and the discrete logarithm

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,380
assumption with a transparent setup

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,599
they do not require any pairing

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,159
operations

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,380
foreign

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,840
first we'll present a new type of zero

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,399
knowledge range argument

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,739
we devise a new variant of the bit

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,559
decomposition approach to prove that a

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,660
committed value is in the range between

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,800
0 and the two power n minus 1.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,020
our range argument is tailored to

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,420
confidential transactions on blockchain

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,219
platforms

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,100
it achieves n to the power of two-thirds

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,800
sublinear efficiency in communication

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,780
and verification

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,840
the major breakthrough is that verifying

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,360
our range argument consumes a comparable

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,119
amount of gas costs to that of the most

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,880
efficient Zeke snark without resorting

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,180
to any trusted setup on ethereum

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,759
our argument also supports the

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,159
aggregation of multiple Arguments for

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,220
further Improvement in efficiency

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,979
the table at the bottom shows the proof

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,740
size and the verification gas costs on

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,400
ethereum for a 32-bit and a 64-bit range

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
respectively

38
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,360
second we will introduce a new zero

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
knowledge argument of a polynomial

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
evaluation

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,000
the argument aims to prove a public

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,860
polynomial relation between two

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,659
committed values

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,240
we provide two zero knowledge protocols

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,299
which are optimized for lower and higher

46
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,720
degree polynomials respectively our

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,180
protocols build on the work of buyer and

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,619
growth

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,500
to the best of our knowledge our

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,020
argument can instantiate the most

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,819
communication efficient membership

52
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,099
argument in the discrete logarithm

53
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,440
setting among those not requiring

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,480
trusted setups

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,060
it also supports the aggregation of

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,160
multiple arguments sharing the same

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,660
inputs

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,879
the table illustrates an efficiency

59
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,900
comparison of bg13 and our two arguments

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,739
for lower and higher degree polynomials

61
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,800
it can be observed that our arguments

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,920
achieves a non-trivial Improvement

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,319
improving verification and proof size

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,239
if you're interested in our work please

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,760
come and watch our presentation on 6th

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,018
December thank you
