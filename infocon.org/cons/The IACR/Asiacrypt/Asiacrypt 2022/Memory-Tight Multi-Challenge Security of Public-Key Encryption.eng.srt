hi everyone I am akshaya and this is

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,220
Joint work with Joseph Jacob in our work

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,260
we can see Siri secure encryption

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,840
schemes with proofs and a multi-user

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,120
multi-children setting that are tight

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,460
with respect to time advantage and

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,580
memory we start by recalling why memory

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,320
is important in the concrete security

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
analysis of schemes

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,939
traditionally the most commonly

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,859
considered resource in concrete security

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,098
analysis is computational time

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,620
our bucket all introduced the notion of

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,840
memory attack reductions in crypto 17

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,420
where they advocated that on top of the

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,579
reduction being tight and advantage and

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,040
computational time it should also be

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
tired in memory this is important in

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,800
particular for memory sensitive problems

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,200
that is problems that are easier to

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,059
solve with more memory

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,399
a concrete example is the discrete

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,980
logarithm problem in Prime fields

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,199
here's a memory time plot for the

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
discrete log problem in time fields

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,900
each point in the plot represents the

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,939
success probability of the adversary for

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,799
the corresponding resources

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,380
as we can see the problem becomes easier

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,080
to solve with sufficient memory

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,180
let us say we want the scheme to be

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,920
secured against all adversities

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,400
constrained by the resources at Point a

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,799
if our reduction uses significantly

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,439
greater memory than pay we end up with

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,840
an algorithm whose resources suffice to

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,119
break the discrete log problem in finite

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
fields

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,840
this does not yield any meaningful

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,820
conclusions about the security of the

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,000
scheme If instead we have a memory type

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,460
deduction for the same scale it allows

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,920
us to be secure even for a massively

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,079
larger computational time

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,540
our work was motivated by this

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,299
observation and we could struct skins

47
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,520
for which reductions are tied in time

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
advantage and memory we call such

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,540
reduction stem diet

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,219
specifically may give template results

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,699
for PKA schemes in the Camden paradigm

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,580
the Kingdom Construction of PKS can be

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,520
visualized as three components the camp

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,239
the dam and finally the composition

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,580
we analyzed the public key components of

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,440
the Camden Construction in the

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
multi-challenge multi-user setting and

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
we Advocate the analysis of schemes in

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,060
the multi-user multi-challen study as

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
schemes get deployed across multiple

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,739
users each of whom uses the scheme

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,120
multiple times

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,760
we would want that the security of the

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,220
scheme does not secrete with users or

65
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,200
queries

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
the memory tightness of key

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
encapsulation mechanisms or chems has

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,900
been widely analyzed in literature

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,340
#amount family of chemist has been of

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,840
specific interest

71
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,080
in 2017 our bucket all conjectured the

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,540
memory type probes for hashtagamarkins

73
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,519
were impossible

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,819
in Euro Cup 2020 goshalun tesero gave

75
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,040
impossibility results and a memory lower

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,980
Bound for hashtag command camps

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,040
at the same time but acharya gave memory

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,379
type fruits for hashtag American's in

79
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,180
Asia group 2020

80
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,819
in our work we unravel the facts and

81
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,500
fallacies of these seemingly

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
contradicting results and give proofs

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,840
for hashtag Americans that are tight in

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,700
the market that are time type in the

85
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,220
multi-user multi-children setting

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,280
our contributions are the following

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,340
first we give time troops for augmented

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,400
versions of various hashtag markhams in

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,920
the multi-user multi-challen setting

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
we also introduce a new diffie-hub in

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,780
Assumption for one of our groups which

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,720
we believe to maybe use independent

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,700
interest

94
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,680
additionally we give 10 type roots for

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,540
augmented versions of the Fujisaki

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,700
okamoto transformations

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,099
finally we lift our results with the

98
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,959
cameras to time tightly prove the

99
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,180
security of pke skins in the Camden

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,360
paradigm please attend a full version of

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,580
I talk and refer to the full version of

102
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,500
our paper to see the details of our

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,079
proof techniques and much more thank you
