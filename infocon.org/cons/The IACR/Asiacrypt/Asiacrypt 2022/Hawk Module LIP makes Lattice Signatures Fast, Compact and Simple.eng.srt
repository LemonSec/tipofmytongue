00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,958
hi my name is Ludo and I will presenting

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,120
Arc of Asia quick this year

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
it's a Letter's based signature scheme

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,620
it's based on the module that is

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,360
isomorphism problem

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,120
and the signature scheme is is fast

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,760
there's complex signatures

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,800
and it's simple to implement

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
and this work was joined

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Leo aim and vessel all from CWI

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,240
and the motivation for this work was

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,059
despite Falcon having small keys and

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,579
signatures business recommended the

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,620
lithium in general

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,040
and the reason for this that Falcon used

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,700
golf sampling that requires floating

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,980
points and this was complicated because

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,600
on constraint devices there is no

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
support for filtering boards and Falcon

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,760
had to simulate

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,300
these and this is rather slow

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,680
and

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,019
also when you use floats it's difficult

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,060
to mask

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,080
and for Falcon this was

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,760
a fundamental

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
to the cloud of Entry lattices that they

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
used

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,640
and

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
there are a lot of

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,840
ways that people try to fix this issue

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,420
with Falcon and for us the starting

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,060
point was that we looked at the integer

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
lattice said to independent

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,040
and on this lattice sampling is super

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
easy

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
so how can we make a secure signature

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
scheme out of this

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,520
so layer muscle

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,079
in

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,540
you're equipped this year shows that you

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
can make a secure signature scheme let

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,860
this is Mark is a problem

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,460
and by using a rotation of satyrian and

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,740
making this rotation public

46
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,560
well keeping the reticular with a secret

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,500
and a contribution is that we make a

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,360
particular instantiation

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,000
of the signature scheme and it's called

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,679
Hawk and

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
the signature sizes are 20 smaller than

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
metal falcon

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,300
and when you look at the performance on

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,959
X 86 processor

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,680
form is twice as good as Falcon and four

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,860
times faster for signing

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,500
and the main advantages of Falcon is

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
that there are no floating points in

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,420
signing and verification

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,620
and

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,900
when there is no support for floating

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,140
points this makes signing 15 times

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,580
faster

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,660
kind of Falcon

65
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:53,040
and how does it work so in short August

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Action Sign signature scheme will set to

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,879
the end

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,260
and a security base is based on lip

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,040
and

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,900
to make its competitive we've added the

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,900
ring structure move to a module version

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,700
of it

73
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,680
then moreover we apply some compression

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,800
on the public key and signatures

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,780
and for the signatures we could even

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,300
drop half of it the signature

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,220
and

78
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,400
also we actually Target

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,379
off the entity of letters

80
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,840
and this allows us to only use two

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Samplers on offset and Z shifts by one

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,180
half

83
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,000
and this makes the sampling faster it's

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,860
easy to make all the time and certainly

85
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,299
uses integers

86
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,920
and

87
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
that's it for now if you wanted for more

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,120
details look at the presentation and

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,340
hope to see you bye bye

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
bye
