1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,780
hi I'm anxious and I'm briefly introduce

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,120
our new paper Compact and typically

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,740
select the opening skill publicly

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,200
encryption schemes this is join work

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,360
with judging Pine

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,059
and in the PK setting we have a receiver

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,039
and a receiver have a publicly and

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,440
secret key the send we have a lot of

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,600
centers and they can use the public key

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
to increase the message with some

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
Randomness and then send a cyber text to

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,900
the receiver

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,859
we consider setting that now to send us

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,780
Randomness and message will be revealed

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,059
to some anniversary and because the

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,219
adversary get the message and Randomness

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,280
it can completely break the security of

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,460
the cyber attacks uh we say a cyber text

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
is open it is Randomness and message are

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,920
both revealed

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,160
so now some server texts are open and we

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,920
will ask how about the unopened cyber

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,960
text to the unopened subtext remain

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,640
secure

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,520
and the sender select open security

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,400
consider such setting or shorten it so

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,720
security

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
in the SEO security the adversary gets a

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,119
bunch of Chinese sub attacks and it can

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,159
also open some of the child in sub

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,920
attacks the so security requires that

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,260
the unopened Child Services remains

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,020
secure so security is a very practical

34
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,540
notion for example sometimes the

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,060
sender's computer may be crafted by some

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,979
hacker and the hacker can get all the

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,780
information about the sender including

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,600
messages and the renderness or the

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
sender can use some maybe use some

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,100
insecure Randomness generator and the

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,500
rosary can recover the such insecure

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,939
randomness

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,640
The Selective open security has been

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,619
studied for a long time and it can date

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,320
back to the 1999

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,600
um there are two flavors of iso security

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,180
notion indistinguished ability base and

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,340
Social Security and the simulation based

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,200
as Social Security or shortlist same as

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,899
so Security in this work we just focus

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,680
on the same so security

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,420
in terms of that the same as of security

53
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,300
is strictly stronger than the standard

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,720
pke security notion like the indcca

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,780
and it's highly contribute to achieved

56
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,840
same as so security because there's a

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,599
dilemma if we want to in you want to

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,360
prove security we we should invest some

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,180
problem instance into the Cyber text but

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,400
if we embed the instance to the Cyber

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,140
text then we can open the server text

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,959
because we do not have the randomness

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,720
and for example one way one may wonder

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,940
if we can use the hybrid argument plus

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,180
an idcc to achieve the same as of

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,080
security

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
this such hybrid argument doesn't work

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000
because if we want to use the hybrid

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,300
argument to switch the charge ciphertext

70
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
to random then we can open the Cyber

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,959
text

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,720
and of course there's a true solution to

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,660
deal with such problems we just guess

74
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,940
which cyber test will not be open by the

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,340
adversary but this solution is not very

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,080
good because there's some value

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,519
probability

78
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,159
since the reduction may get strong and

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,959
it leads to some non-ti security

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,019
so we ask can we have SIM socc scheme

81
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,319
with high security the answer is yes but

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,560
it's not very satisfactory

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
um some group based same Associates with

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,379
Thai security they have a long time tax

85
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,239
or long public key

86
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,940
long public key means that the group at

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,680
the number of group elements in the

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,220
public key is not a constant it depends

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,040
on the length of the message

90
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,700
and long cyber text similarly

91
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,940
the drawbacks that the non-compact pke

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,120
they have a very high uh very high

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,299
communication overhead

94
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,459
so in this one we want to solve this

95
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,280
problem can we have a SIM socc scheme

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
such that they actually achieves the

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,260
Thai security compact publicly and

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,319
compact subjects at the same time and we

99
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
find this problem is very hard and we

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,700
want to relax some requirements

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,279
how about in the random Oracle model can

102
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,380
we have such steam in a random Oracle

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,760
model

104
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
our paper give a positive answer to this

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,560
question we propose three direct

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,600
constructions in the genetic

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
construction they are all compact

108
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,919
entirely same SOC skill in the random

109
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
Oracle model

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,160
um there are some techniques used in our

111
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,840
paper but I'm not going to introduce

112
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,139
them there and our full talk will be

113
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,840
given in the Thursday morning and thank

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,639
you for attention we also thank vanity

115
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,320
Wagner for his helpful comments
