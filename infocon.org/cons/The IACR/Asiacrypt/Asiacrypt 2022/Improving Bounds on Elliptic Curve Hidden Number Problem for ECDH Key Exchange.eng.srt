hello everyone my name is jinxi I'm from

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,760
Institute of information engineering

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,460
challenge academic of science

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,719
lest I will give an introduction for our

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,260
paper the title is improving Bonds on

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,519
elliptic curve hidden lamp problem for

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
ecth King Exchange

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,559
Crypt turn some one but lay Elevate and

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,600
how Grable ground

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,820
faster in produced The Liberty curve

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,180
heightened number problem for short

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,739
echmp in order to expect the result of

13
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,920
bit security for ecth King exchange on a

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
fixture code

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,879
at the pkc 2017

16
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,180
Channing came a TV Herman version of

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,420
easy easy hmp called Shanice is a hmp

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,260
Shani used this version to get the

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,720
faster records

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,680
beta security result of

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,340
ecth on a fixed cone

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,640
shell is easy hmp can be viewed as a

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,960
elliptical curve analogy of the height

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
and Lumbar problem for short hmp

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,640
similar the hmp propeller Shelly's EC

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
hmp can be also used for parametrical

27
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,079
crypto lenses of ecth King exchanger in

28
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,759
the case of

29
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,740
side Channel attacks in this work we

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,700
revisit the Corpus method to save the

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,679
system of modular polynomial equipment

32
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,420
from Chinese EC hmp we considered the

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,819
correlation of original polynomial under

34
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,540
constructed enough help for polymers for

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,720
the corpse with method

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,099
compared to previous work we showed that

37
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,640
shallis EC hmp can be solved for any

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,300
constant output functions in polio

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,640
polynomial time

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,500
before this work the better result is

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,480
that shallis easy hmp can be solved in

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,700
polynomial time when the output function

43
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,300
equals 1 over 2 which is a typical

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,540
result use the

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,319
cops with method in other words we

46
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,200
significantly

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,040
improve the bound because of the

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,800
realistic curve involved in the cops

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,819
Miss method we do not get the records

50
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:29,040
with secretive for ecth King exchange on

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,780
a fixed curve

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,640
we verified the heuristic unlisted

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,599
curves use experiments for small

54
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,299
Dimension that is

55
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,420
and so thanks for your listening
