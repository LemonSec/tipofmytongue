00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone I'd like to talk to you a

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,819
little bit about radical isogenes

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,400
which is a topic in isogeny based

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,940
cryptography that has applications to a

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,639
lot of different schemes that use group

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,299
actions

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,500
so one of these schemes that uses group

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,260
actions is called C sites

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,960
which is a certain post Quantum key

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
exchange protocol so we have a starting

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,380
public elliptic curve e0

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,960
and Alice and Pope both have a secret

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,500
elements of a certain group that acts on

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,719
elliptic curves

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,879
so what they do is they both act on the

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,040
starting curve and then they send the

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,660
result to each other

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,399
and then they act on what they receive

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,379
from the other person

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,500
and as long as the group action is

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,239
commutative

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,820
which it is in this case because the C

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,699
and C side stands for commutative

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,100
the result they get in the end is going

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,199
to be the same

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,840
now what's really cool about Seaside is

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,680
that it has very small keys so compared

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,780
to all the other

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,180
post Quantum key exchange protocols it

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,060
has the smallest keys but it's

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,520
relatively slow

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,619
and the reason it's slow is because

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,939
Computing the group action is slow

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,759
so the secrets of Alice and Bob they

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,700
correspond to Maps between elliptic

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,659
curves

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,180
that we call isogenes

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,700
and these Maps typically have a very

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,259
large degree

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,579
but they decompose into lots of smaller

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,139
maps of smaller degrees

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,799
so essentially Computing the group

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,659
action boils down to

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,780
Computing chains of

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,619
isogenes of small degree

46
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,840
so how do you do that so for example how

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,799
do you compute a chain of five isogenies

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,038
one way to do it is to sample on each of

49
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,080
the Curves in your sequence

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,400
a point of order 5 and then to set the

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,560
next curve to be the quotient by this

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,819
point

53
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,459
and that works

54
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,780
but it kind of sucks because uh first of

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
all generating this random points

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,720
it can fill with a certain probability

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,900
and then you have to try again and this

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,060
is not super good for

59
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,920
for example constant time

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,200
implementations

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,060
and also as mentioned it's quite slow

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,720
so the dream would be that instead of

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,599
having to sample a random point every

64
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,459
time

65
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,040
for there to just be maybe some kind of

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,739
formula depending on say the

67
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,459
coefficients of the curve that just

68
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,400
always gives me the next curve in the

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
sequence

70
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,080
and that's exactly what radical isogenes

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,420
does

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,159
so for example this is radical five

73
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,560
isogenes so let's say that we have an

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,200
elliptic curve that is of this special

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,519
form for some value of the parameter B

76
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,340
then the radical five exogeny formula

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,580
tells me what the next curve in the

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,239
sequence of five isogenes is going to be

79
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,180
in terms of this parameter B

80
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,819
so it's this very simple expression that

81
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,980
depends on the fifth root of B and this

82
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,799
is much faster so compared to sampling

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,180
random points

84
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,060
this is much better and this is

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,640
currently the fastest way to compute

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,540
long chains of five isogenes

87
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,659
and you can in fact proof so you can

88
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,080
show that for every degree n there

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,200
exists a radical isogeny formula but the

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,939
question is how do you find them like

91
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,180
how do you find this magic expression so

92
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,019
that's not super obvious but uh that's

93
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,478
that's basically what we what we did

94
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,800
so

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,460
we found a new method to obtain the

96
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,560
formulas which is based on the theory of

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
modular curves

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,780
that extends the range for the N for

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,540
which we know the formulas and then for

100
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,400
the formulas that we have we also

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,740
rewrote them a little bit

102
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,080
so that they are more efficient to

103
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
evaluate

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,100
and we show that this leads to

105
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,620
significant speed ups for protocols such

106
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,580
as Seaside
