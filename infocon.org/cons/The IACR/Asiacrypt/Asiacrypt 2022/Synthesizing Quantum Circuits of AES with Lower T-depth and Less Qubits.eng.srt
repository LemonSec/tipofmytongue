00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,899
hello everyone I'm Johnny Huang this is

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,120
an abstract of our paper synthesizing

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,000
Corner circuits of AES with lower T

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,099
depth and less curious

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,519
this work is jointed with situation

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,100
our work is motivated from Quantum

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,220
attacks to symmetric ciphers to apply a

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,560
Quantum attack the attacker needs an

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,560
attack circuit based on Quantum gates in

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,779
the quantum circuit for the encryption

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,420
process is a part of the text circuit

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,059
the our work is focused on reducing the

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,219
cost of this encryption circuit

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,059
especially the cost of AES circuit

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,399
our first contribution is a new general

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,500
structure for constructing the whole

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,440
encryption circuit in previous works all

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,780
structures use auto play circuit for

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,820
wrong Transformations as sub circuits

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,760
here out of place means output we need

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,399
is stored in some different qubits than

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,920
the input due to the use of this

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,320
autoplay circuits these structures have

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,140
some redundant outputs and the width

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,119
which is the number of cubits will

26
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,240
increase with number of wrong increases

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,180
here we present a message to construct

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,060
the In-Place round circuit from two out

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,740
of place sub circuit

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,780
but this structure the width of the

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,000
circuit will not increase after each

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,960
round

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,540
here is comparison of our new structure

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,420
with other ones

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,580
our second contribution is some

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,860
techniques for implementing linear and

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,140
nonlinear Transformations for linear

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,540
ones it's well known that an invertible

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,820
linear transformation can be implemented

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,939
by an In-Place C naught circuit the

41
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,040
weaker achieved such thing not Circuit

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,860
by po decomposition or some heuristic

43
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,060
evidence

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,000
but the circus appears from these

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,040
matters are not optimal

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,740
here we propose a new set-based method

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,320
for financing of circuit with a minimum

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
number of case

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
the idea of our method is encoding the

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
problem of finding a circuit with kks

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,659
into a set problem

52
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,020
air experiments show that by all method

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,480
problems with side less than Knight base

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,940
can be solved in a reasonable time

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,379
our next problem is implementing

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,620
nonlinear transformations in place given

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,200
an out-of-play Circuit of function f we

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,020
call it a c0 circuit if it works when

59
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,420
output wires are initialized to zero

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,660
where we call it a c star circuit if it

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,520
works when the output wires are

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,280
initialized to non-zero then we can

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,260
classify the nonlinear Transformations

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,440
into two kinds the first one is a vessel

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,300
logic transformation which can be

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,900
implemented in place by RC star circuit

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,599
the second one is the substitution like

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,060
transformation which can be implemented

69
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,819
in place by two c0 circuits with the

70
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,340
structure we introduced before

71
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,459
furthermore we propose some criteria for

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,940
efficiently designing system circuits

73
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,980
and under this

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,440
criteria assist dot circuit can be

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,980
constructed from a special c0 second by

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,620
adding a c North sub circuit

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,200
by this method we construct a more

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,440
compact c-star Circuit of AES from the

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,140
one proposed then one proposed in Asia

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,300
2020

81
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,819
our next problem is constructing low

82
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,980
depth circuits for nonlinear

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,400
Transformations firstly from an index K

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,340
classical circuit one cannot always obey

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,980
a Tdap scale content Circuit by simple

86
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,239
replacement

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,480
the es Xbox content circuit proposed in

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,780
euroclib 2020 is an example

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,420
here we present a method for

90
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,599
constructing a tdsk Content circuit from

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,480
such classical circuits

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,019
thus applications we construct a tdaps 4

93
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,860
and the tdap3 content circuits for a ESS

94
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,180
box since AES s box has algebraic degree

95
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,540
7 theta 3 is optimal if we follow the

96
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,620
way that from classical to Quantum

97
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,139
based on all these techniques introduced

98
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,280
before we construct some load with

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,720
circuits for AES

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,419
it's easy to see that our circuits are

101
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,639
more compact than the one proposed in

102
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,280
Asia create 2020.

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,340
furthermore we construct some low depth

104
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,639
circuits for AFS comparing to the one

105
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,919
proposing your Crypt our circuit has

106
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,860
lower the depth and lower full depths

107
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,440
at last we aband the trade-off curve

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,520
shown in this speaker

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,540
that's all thank you for your attention
