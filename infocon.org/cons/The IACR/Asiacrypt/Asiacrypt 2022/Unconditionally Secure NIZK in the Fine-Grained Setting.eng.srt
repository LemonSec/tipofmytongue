00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,920
hello everyone my name is I'm from uscc

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,379
our title is unconditionally secure

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
needs key in the fine Green City it's

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,860
Jonah work with charging pipe

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,179
usually in the standard cryptography we

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,039
require that the only party runs

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
important of my time and this game can

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,820
be secure against polynomial time

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,600
adversaries

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,140
by now there have been a lot of

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,180
Primitives proposed based on virus

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,519
assumptions

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
however it's still unclear whether this

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,360
assumptions hold

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,940
if for example we prove that one-way

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,760
function does not exist someday the most

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,620
Primitives will not be secure anymore

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,020
so it's desirable to propose schemes

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,000
based on no assumptions or just some

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
mild complexity assumptions

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,300
although this is quite difficult in a

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,640
standard setting Miracle initialized the

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
study of fine-grained cryptography to

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
approach this problem

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,239
in the fine grain setting we just

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,459
require that the only Supply uses less

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,880
resources than the adversary

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,580
and the resources of the adversary can

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,159
be a prior bounded

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
since the power of the adversary is

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,260
limited it's possible to propose schemes

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,080
based on very mild assumptions or even

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
no assumption in this setting

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
by now there have been many fragrant

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,659
Primitives proposed

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,200
and recently we proposed Franklin nisk

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,320
which runs in nc1

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
and secure against the adversaries in

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,420
nc1 under the assumption that nc1 is not

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,720
equal to parity of Slash poly

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,820
although the underlying Assumption of

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,920
the previous spring green needs is

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,380
already very weak it's still left open

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,960
whether we can construct fragrance under

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,740
no assumptions

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,079
in our work we solve this problem by

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,299
proposing a fully fine green disk for

48
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
ac0 surface viability

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,979
in our construction all the algorithms

50
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,318
including the CRS generator The Proven

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,720
the verifier and the simulator run in

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
ac0 and it has perfect soundness and a

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,140
composable zero knowledge against ac0

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,420
the steel mode has perfect zero

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,560
knowledge and the computational

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,900
soundness against ac0

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,300
it's under no assumption so it's

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,500
unconditionally secure

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,239
here by ac0 we mean the class of

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,580
circuits with constant depth polymer

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,700
size and unbondifying using and or n or

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,440
Gates

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,660
and we also note that a statement

64
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,360
circuit cannot go beyond ac0 otherwise

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,300
if not only is proofer in AC 0 cannot

66
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,980
decide with the witness whether the

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,238
statement is true or not

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,519
but if we allow the prover to run

69
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,800
employment time as in a previous fine

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,560
grain is proposed by Boy and others our

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,379
needs also supports all the statements

72
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,099
in NP

73
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,159
we can also extend our disk to

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,040
non-interactive zaps and also needs in

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,200
the URLs model all of them are

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,780
unconditionally secure in the ac0 finger

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,379
new setting

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,360
also applications of our work we first

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,700
note that our needs can be used to

80
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,500
provide unconditional security against

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,080
adversaries with the limited parallel

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,480
running time

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,120
also our needs can be used in systems

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,099
requiring online security

85
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,860
where the attacks are valid only if they

86
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,940
succeed the immediately

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,580
for example arnisk with composable zero

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,680
knowledge can be used to protect Secrets

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,659
only valuable in a short time

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,519
also it's your mode with computational

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,980
soundness and perfect zero knowledge can

92
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,500
protect the secrets perfectly and can

93
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,299
guarantee the security in the system

94
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,060
requiring the users to provide proofs in

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,200
a short time

96
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,439
if the users cannot provide proofs in a

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,099
short time then we can just Unite

98
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,500
I lost I would like to talk about the

99
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,260
impact of our work before our work it

100
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,660
seemed that cryptographic assumptions

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,259
implying pke were necessary phonics in a

102
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,520
standard model

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,400
which means that needs seem to be in the

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,520
land of crypto Mania

105
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,220
however in the ac0 fingering setting

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,979
only in the mini crypto Primitives such

107
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,840
as the one-way function are known to

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,100
exist

109
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,880
while we achieve nisk

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
so our construction may have provided

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,040
evidence that this case in the land of

112
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,860
mini Crypt even in the standard setting

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,380
and it will be interesting to prove it

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,340
thank you
