00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,040
hello everybody my name is Barbara and I

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,259
am a PhD student at the Technical

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,380
University of darmstadt and in this

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,599
video I want to give you an overview of

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,000
our paper Nostradamus ghost Phantom

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,699
which analyzes the Nostradamus attack on

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,880
hash functions and the quantum setting

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,460
this paper is a joint work together with

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,859
Mike fishlein and mod support

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,740
in case you liked this video and want to

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,019
know more about our paper I would like

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,239
to invite you to hear my talk at Asia

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,000
group and yeah of course to read our

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
paper

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
I will provide all the relevant

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,620
informations on my last slide

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,840
probably you have here the name

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,660
Nostradamus before

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,180
Nostradamus was a well-known pharmacist

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,940
of the 16th century who published poems

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,520
in order to predict the future

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,940
we could call this approach somehow

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,940
secure since it requires real magic to

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,280
write believable poems about future

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
events and it's hard to pretend to be a

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,460
Nostradamus or in other words to be a

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,159
Nostradamus attacker if you are a

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,439
non-musician

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,040
in 2006 cats and Kuno introduced the

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,240
modern Nostradamus who uses cryptography

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,240
instead of poetry for his predictions

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,700
and for them furthermore Carlton and

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,799
Kuno analyzed the effort of a

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,439
non-magician to be a modern Nostradamus

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,000
attacker

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
So This Modern Nostradamus wants to

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
prove his prior knowledge about a

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,820
specific specific event with the help of

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,200
a hash function

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,540
for example he wants to predict the

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,520
numbers of the lottery draw next

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
Saturday

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,060
this would happen like this

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,060
before the lottery draw he commits to a

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,920
hash value by Target and says hey

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,100
I know the lottery numbers but I cannot

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,560
tell you which numbers because then you

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,720
could see the lottery

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,739
and um yeah we don't want this but what

50
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,760
I can tell you is the hash value of my

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
prediction which I would send you after

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,879
the lottery draw and hey you don't need

53
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,420
to try to guess the lottery numbers

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,860
based on this hash value by Target

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,940
because I add a secret signature M to my

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,940
prediction to avoid this

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,879
and afterwards he publishes a document

58
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,940
containing the correct prediction as

59
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,420
well as his signature and having this

60
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,180
hash value by Target

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,819
of course this picture of a modern

62
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,640
Nostradamus is just something to keep in

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
mind to have an intuition

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,459
nonetheless this is a desirable security

65
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,160
property for a hash function that this

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
can only happen if someone knows a

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
lottery numbers

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,220
and there's some assumptions we can

69
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,400
specify the effort of Kelsey and kuna's

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,720
rosadamus attack

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,480
which is a generic attack this means

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,599
that the adversary do not exploit any

73
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,200
concrete details of the Hedge function

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,400
our contribution is the development of a

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
Nostradamus attack in the quantum

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
setting which is a generic attack as

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,260
well and shows that the time complexity

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,319
can be reduced significantly if the

79
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,739
quantum adversary is allowed to use

80
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,120
crowbar's algorithm

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,340
you can see it here

82
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,159
The Factor before n

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,940
changes from two over three to three

84
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,599
over seven

85
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,120
moreover we give a lower Bound for the

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,120
quantum Nostradamus attack by using a

87
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
result of Leo and xandri which proves

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,420
that our attack is essentially optimal

89
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,640
and this is what you can expect from a

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
Target Asia group first I will explain

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,060
our Quantum attack and then I will show

92
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,440
you the proof idea of the lower bones

93
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,680
and as promised you can hit find here on

94
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
my last Slide the link to the full

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,180
and also another link where you can find

101
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,280
thank you for the attention and maybe

102
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,299
see you then again
