00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,840
hello

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,580
um I'm here to encourage you to come and

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,740
see my talk on threshold linear

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,200
homomorphic encryption on Z over 2 to

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,400
the KZ

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,679
so this is Joint work with guillem

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,160
questions and Fabiola Young

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,640
so in this work I suggest the title we

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
provide the first threshold linearly

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,960
homomorphic encryption scheme whose

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,539
message space is set over to the KZ for

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,359
any positive integer k

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,399
now threshold public key encryption

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,920
protocol is a public Key System where

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,680
the private key is distributed among n

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,180
different servers

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,000
it offers high security since no single

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,340
server is interested to perform the

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,500
decryption in its entirety

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
and it's also the core component of many

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,899
multi-party computation protocols which

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,120
involve mutually distrusting parties

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,300
with common goals

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,520
so threshold public key encryption

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,980
Protocols are even more useful when they

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,099
are homomorphic this means that public

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,220
operations on ciphertexts translate to

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,479
operations on the underlying plain texts

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
in particular at eurocrypt 2001 Cramer

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,740
Dam guard and Nielsen provided a new

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,439
approach to multi-party computation from

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,600
linearly homomorphic threshold

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,240
encryption schemes

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,619
in parallel

35
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,740
there's also been a recent interest in

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,799
developing multi-party computations

37
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,259
modulo 2 to the k for a certain integer

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,520
k

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,860
this choice is driven by the fact that

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,880
modern CPU computations are performed

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,460
in such a ring hence if the multi-party

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,079
computation protocol performs

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,720
computations modulo due to the k

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,600
protocol designers can directly apply

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
optimizations they are often expensive

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,640
to emulate if a different modulus is

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,720
used

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,960
so multi-party computation would benefit

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
from an encryption scheme with such a

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,940
message space that supports distributed

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,160
decryption

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,959
and this is exactly what we have

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,180
developed in this work a threshold

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,280
linearly homomorphic encryption scheme

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
whose message space is Z over 2 to the

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,720
KZ for any k

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,459
our construction uses class groups of

58
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,040
imaginary quadratic Fields like the

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,560
encryption schemes modulo and odd prime

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,340
Q of gastanyas and legumi from ctrsa

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,140
2015.

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,120
however as is often the case in number

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,780
Theory moving from an odd prime Q to 2

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,379
or to 2 to the K is not an easy task

65
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,780
and as we'll see in my talk

66
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,000
plugging the modulus to be true to the K

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,760
in their framework doesn't work

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,700
and so if you come to my talk you will

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,760
find out how we overcome this challenge

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,239
how we manage to realize for the first

71
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,239
time a public key encryption scheme with

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,940
all three of these properties

73
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,640
I hope to see you next Tuesday

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,299
goodbye
