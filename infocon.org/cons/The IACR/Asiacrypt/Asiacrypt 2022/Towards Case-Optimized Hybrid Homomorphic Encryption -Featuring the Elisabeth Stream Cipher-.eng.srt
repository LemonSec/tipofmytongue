00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
hello my name is and I'm going to

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,860
introduce a paper to our case optimize

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,180
here with a demomorphic encryption

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,480
featuring the visibility screensaver

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,940
hybrid thermomorphic encryption or HTT

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,040
for short is a tool used in fully

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,599
homomorphic encryption to reduce the

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
bond with usage by sending anomomorphic

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,260
encryption of the key of a small

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,600
symmetric scheme to the server and then

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,859
using that scheme for every other

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,180
transfer

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,580
if expansion ratio of this red scheme is

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,500
smaller than the gray it's a win

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,300
which is an app to automatically get

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,098
from the Redbox to the Grapevine server

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,860
side and a person called transfering it

18
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,760
can get some time to do

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,140
several energy schemes are emerged over

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,239
the years trying to optimize and aspect

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,160
or another of the transitive array

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,719
without of them have measured their

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,480
performances as Standalone schemes

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,700
skills we on the other one sync an

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,079
entity scheme should always be

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
considered with respect to a relevant

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,379
use case and with that in mind we

28
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,480
created a new scheme called azervet as a

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,680
successor of current state of the art

30
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,260
crypto system Philip

31
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,000
Elizabeth has been designed to be easy

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,159
to evaluate on multiple threads and can

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,659
stock up to 4-bit messages in every

34
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,040
Cipher text

35
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
mitsubish data a rule for an easier

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,820
integration with a common fact use case

37
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,460
neural network inference

38
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,439
we showed that with some tweaks applied

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,180
on the network prior to any encryption

40
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,979
it is possible to evaluate the small

41
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,540
neural network with a little bit safer

42
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,580
text as input

43
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,200
this comes at a cost on the inference

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,939
time which can be reduced with some Bond

45
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,080
viscosity optimization

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,180
however using either bet proved to be

47
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,640
worthy from the very first inference on

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
the previously manual optimization are

49
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,399
also rapidly compensated
