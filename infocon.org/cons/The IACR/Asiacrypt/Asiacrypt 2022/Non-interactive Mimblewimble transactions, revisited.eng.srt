00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,019
hi my name is Michaela and this talk is

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,060
about bimbo wimble non-interactive

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,760
transactions this joint work with KR

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,420
foxpower

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,320
gimbawimble is a cryptocurrency

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,199
initially proposed in 2016 by an

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,180
anonymous author going by the name of

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,279
Tom Elvis chatosaur the name of

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,840
Voldemort in the French edition of Harry

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,920
Potter

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,260
it is based of three main ideas from

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
Gregory Maxwell initially envisioned for

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,539
Bitcoin namely confidential transactions

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,120
which have privacy on the top of Bitcoin

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,100
by replacing plain text values with

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,559
homomorphic commitments

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,500
coin join which has anonymity on the top

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,719
of Bitcoin by allowing transactions to

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,700
be merged and shuffling inputs and

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,320
outputs so to destroy the link between

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,820
them

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,520
and transaction cut through which is not

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,320
really available in Bitcoin but should

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,980
allow to provide scalability by removing

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,899
unnecessary data from the blockchain

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,520
like outputs that have been already

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,379
spent

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,600
in this talk we will use another key

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,820
idea namely stealth addresses that have

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,500
been initially proposed in crypto node

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,420
and are now used in cryptocurrencies

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,280
such as Monero

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,920
since 2016 a number of cryptocurrencies

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,680
have started to use nimblewimble like

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,799
beam or green and more recently mimbo

36
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,500
wimble coin or an extension of Litecoin

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,540
called mweb

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,540
in late 2018 together with Kirk Fox

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,420
Bauer and yaniquezel we published a

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
formal security model for mimo wimble

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,220
called aggregate cache system and we

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,680
proved that the initial version proposed

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,960
in 2016 satisfies this model

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
in this work we strengthened this model

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,340
by giving stronger security guarantees

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,920
and stronger anonymity guarantees to our

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,740
model and then we provide a new schemes

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,399
that satisfies these properties

49
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,840
this scheme also allows for

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,939
non-interactive transactions and small

51
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,100
variants of it are now in use by nibble

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,799
wimblecoin and by Litecoin

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,119
where the first one to provide

54
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,920
non-interactive transactions in the

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,479
wimble and to have it deployed in the

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,899
real world

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,239
the Breakthrough of mimbo wimble is that

58
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,340
it is possible to activate transactions

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,200
more interactively while preserving

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,340
security

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,980
for instance it is possible to aggregate

62
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,319
transactions a transaction transaction

63
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,879
Prime and a transaction transaction

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,580
second into a new transaction while

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,040
preserving security

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,540
additionally and this is the cut through

67
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,700
idea that I was talking about it is

68
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,500
possible to remove outputs that are

69
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,819
immediately being spent

70
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,319
unfortunately some metadata information

71
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,019
namely the access which guarantees that

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,120
a transaction is balanced is not

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,819
spending more money than allowed

74
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,280
in an aggregate once aggregated

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,739
these make the information leaks

76
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,019
information about the constituent

77
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,060
transactions and so it could be used to

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,519
relate inputs to outputs this is one of

79
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,560
the open problems in our model that we

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,879
tackle

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,560
secondly

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,720
in order to make a transaction in mimbo

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,340
wimble you need both sender and

84
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,739
recipient to be online there is no

85
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,959
concept of wallet or address to send

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,180
money to this is very different from

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,519
other cryptocurrencies and this is the

88
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,780
second problem that we tackle

89
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,560
additionally something that was not

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
considered in our previous model was

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,819
what happens if an adversary tampers

92
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,620
with transactions before they reach the

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,760
Ledger

94
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,340
our new notion transaction binding says

95
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
that once a transaction is broadcasted

96
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,140
only the intended recipient can spend

97
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,399
that particular output

98
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,099
our new notion of privacy says that not

99
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,659
only the values in a transaction are

100
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,239
hidden but also that it is not possible

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
to decompose and aggregate transaction

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,040
relating inputs and outputs that belong

103
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
to the same simple transaction

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,099
also we enforce that recipients of our

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,099
transactions are hidden and only the

106
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,599
recipient can understand what's

107
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,220
happening in a particular transaction

108
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,760
output

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680
the two key ideas in order to achieve

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
these are stealth addresses and

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
transaction offset

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,298
stealth addresses allow us for having

113
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,620
non-interactive transactions and they're

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,560
roughly speaking work as follow

115
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
you know when Alice wants to send some

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,639
money to Bob

117
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,979
it will generate a one-time public key

118
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,340
from Bob's public key an observer cannot

119
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,900
link the one-time public key to the

120
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,639
public key itself

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,460
Bob has Associated to the public key A

122
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,100
View key and a secret key from The View

123
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,020
key it is possible to generate the

124
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,780
one-time public key so Bob can just scan

125
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,699
transaction outputs to find the ones

126
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,280
that belong to him using the secret key

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Bob will be able to span

128
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
the output related to the one-time

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,639
public key that was generated

130
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,880
perception offset add a way of providing

131
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,979
privacy to

132
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,620
non-interactive coin joint and the way

133
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,400
to do that is to add a new random offset

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,639
to the access in such a way that when

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,919
merging transactions together no

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,620
information about the single accesses

137
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,900
reveals information about the outputs

138
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,280
and the inputs

139
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,320
this feature was already available in

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
green for a couple years but we provide

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,340
the First Security models of its

142
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,359
guarantees in this work

143
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,680
the resulting transactions in our scheme

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
look something as follows we have the

145
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,940
one-time public keys that were

146
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,800
introduced with stealth offsets and that

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
allow for non-interactive transactions

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,259
and the signatures that are on there

149
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,560
this one-time public key now these

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,300
signatures do not relate inputs to

151
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,460
outputs instead we use an equation

152
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,220
similar to the one that we've just seen

153
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,800
for the access to provide it a

154
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,960
transaction is valid

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,060
you know to provide privacy as mentioned

156
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,460
before we have these transaction offsets

157
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,139
to be included

158
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,660
and as in vanilla member wimble and

159
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,940
confidential transactions the value of a

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
transaction are replaced with a

161
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,840
homomorphic commitment to them

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,820
paired with a range proof that the

163
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,060
proves no other wrap was done

164
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,280
wrapping up we strengthen the model of

165
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,699
aggregate care system of euroquip 2019

166
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,400
and we provide a new scheme that allows

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,380
for an interactive transaction and our

168
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,900
scheme is in use by mimbo wimblecoin and

169
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,099
by Litecoin thank you
