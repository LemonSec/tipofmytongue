00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,040
hello everyone it's a great time to

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,500
share our work on glitching a text of

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,280
Pusha 3 with you at the Asia crypto 2022

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,040
so in this smart talk I will give a

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,440
brief introduction of the previous works

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,920
and our progress let's first have a look

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,039
at the shelter harsh family it consists

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,880
of six in instances and Each of which is

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
based on the sponge construction with

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
the paychecker permutation as the

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,520
underlying permutation in the previous

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,480
works at most five runs are covered and

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,300
in this work we present the first six

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,540
run the Christian attack Sanctuary the

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,640
previous Works take a three-step

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,539
framework that is a first generate the

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
cladding Trail and then construct

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,760
connectors and at the last exhaustive

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,460
research for glitching pants

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,059
the limitations are from two aspects for

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,580
gliding Trail is difficult to find

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,500
better Trails because it's highly

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,380
dependent on the general Trail search

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,500
which is a difficult problem itself and

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,140
both the collector construction due to

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,420
the quick consumption of the degree of

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,060
freedom is impossible to extend one more

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,960
round in this work we propose a set best

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
trial set toolkit that generates beta

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,900
gliding Trail and the connecting Trail

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,119
and the best sandwich recommend

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,659
six-strand cleaning attacks

33
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:38,540
feminate similar to other two best

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,900
automatic Trail search approach the set

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,079
implementation is quite generic we first

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,020
translate the problem to languages that

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,600
the software can understand and then we

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
solve it in this work we choose crypto

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,799
mini set as our server and describe the

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,340
propagation as well as the objective

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,360
function with the synapse that the

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,459
server can understand

43
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,818
with the set best

44
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,160
toolkit we implement the truncated

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,860
differential Trail search the gliding

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,080
Trail search and the connecting Trail

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,660
search with better results and a good

48
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,220
efficiency

49
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,920
so with the setbacks to hit the attack

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,319
strategy of the Christian attack is

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,440
direct we first generate a foreign

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,260
cladding Trail and then we determine the

53
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,680
two or three round connecting Trail

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,900
and in the connector construction the

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,540
really we only leave the equations on

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,720
messages and the solution styles are a

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,480
subset of message pairs that will follow

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,319
or partially follow the connecting Trail

59
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,739
then in the exhaustive

60
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:00,840
search phase we will enumerate the

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,260
message pairs until a gliding pair is

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,099
obtained so in total we propose the

63
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,099
first six round cliching attacks on

64
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,459
shastri instances and

65
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,480
that include a sixth round uh Collision

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,540
attacks on Shake one to eight in both

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,980
classical and Quantum settings and uh

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,620
uh on the two Quantum Collision attacks

69
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,840
on uh Street 256 and the 224

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,300
um okay that's all for our work thanks

71
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,959
for your listening
