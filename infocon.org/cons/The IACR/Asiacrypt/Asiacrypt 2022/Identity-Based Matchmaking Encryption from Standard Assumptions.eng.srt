00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,620
hello everyone my name is really in this

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,319
video I will give a brief overview of

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,900
our work on building identity based

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,599
matchmaking encryption scheme under the

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,519
standard assumptions in the standard

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,420
model

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,359
this is a joint work with geoton ji

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,300
minwoon and Jiang Wong

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,640
let's start with the introduction of

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,039
identity based matchmaking equipment

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,880
short for ibme which was proposed by a

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,360
Chinese letter in crypto 2019

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,239
here are an authority a center and a

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,300
receiver The Authority First initializes

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,000
the system and produces the most popular

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,680
key mpk and the master secret key msk

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,219
it uses the msk to generate the centers

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,739
and the receiver's secret keys with

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,440
their identities respectively

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
then the center will specify an identity

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,840
of the receiver on the Fly

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,420
and equips the message with his secret

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,299
key and receiver's identity

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,060
was receiving the cipher text the

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,640
receiver will also specify an identity

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,540
of the center he wants to receive from

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,360
decryption algorithm will test if the

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,700
identities satisfy each other

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,040
if yes the receiver will get the correct

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,540
message

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
this is identity based matchmaking

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,759
encryption where both the center and the

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,520
receiver with their own attributes can

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,159
specify fine current access policies the

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,100
other party must satisfy in order for

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,560
the message to be reviewed

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
the concept of IBM me was proposed by

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,579
Attorneys at all in crypto 2019

39
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,860
and they give the first work on their

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320
pth assumption but in the random Oracle

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,939
model

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,640
then Francis proposed the first

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,340
Construction in the plan model but under

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,439
q-type assumption

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,500
so it Remains the problem can we build

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,140
an IBM scheme under the standard

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,598
assumptions in the standard model

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,599
in this work we reserve it and give the

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,720
first construction under sxdh assumption

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,580
in the standard model

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,459
we propose a new technique for Designing

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,200
ibme skins

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,840
our construction is director and does

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,180
not rely on other crypto tools

55
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,580
we present a variety of two level ibe to

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,420
satisfy the same functionality of ibme

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,700
this two-level construction with

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,420
anonymity and delegation consists of

59
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,280
anonymous identity based encryption and

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
signature

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,900
we choose Trends Anonymous idea as our

62
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,560
Baseline which is based on automotive

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,379
and taximers through Peril in Vector

64
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,580
species

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,420
this two level aib corresponding to the

66
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,300
two security requirements of IBM is

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,940
respectively and both security

68
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,700
reductions rely on Waters through system

69
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,019
encryption

70
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,440
in the fourth talk I will introduce in

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
detail how to combine aib and signature

72
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,019
together to build this Q level

73
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,360
construction and apply them in the

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,819
context of ibme

75
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,519
security related content will also be

76
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,019
presented

77
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,480
you can also see the full version of our

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,239
paper on ePrint hope to see you next

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,519
week and our session is next Thursday

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,319
that's all thank you
