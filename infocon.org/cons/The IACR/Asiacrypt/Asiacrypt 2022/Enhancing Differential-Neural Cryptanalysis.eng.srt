analysis the differential neural Crypt

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,940
analysis was proposed by Gore in the

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,139
seminal work in crypto 2019

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,800
in the improved key recovery framework a

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
classical differential is combined with

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,100
a neural distinguisher besides a highly

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,580
selective key guessing strategy was used

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,859
in the framework the neural

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,620
distinguisher is built by training

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,620
neural networks to distinguish two types

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,800
of server text pairs

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,960
pairs whose corresponding plant axis

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,379
have a specific difference and pairs

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,280
whose plant taxes are randomly selected

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,280
tragedies suffer is the smallest version

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,539
of the light which blocks ever specs

17
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,800
3264 which is an ARX server

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,619
the neural network structure is a

19
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,740
commonly used deep residual Network

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,100
to reach any schemes were used to obtain

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,580
up to eight runs in your distinguishers

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,520
this near distinguishers are shown to

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,100
have the pure accuracy than the full

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,020
differential distribution based

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,960
distinguishers

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,180
using this neural distinguishers under

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,360
the improved key recovery framework

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,720
with comparable data complexity the time

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,600
complexity of the tech and 11 rounds

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,659
with reduced obviously

31
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,140
this goes into the next questions to

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,659
what extent is the advantage of

33
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,180
differential neural analysis over

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,299
traditional method and whether the

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,939
advantage generally exists in the crypto

36
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,299
analysis of modern ciphers

37
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,119
to answer the first question we device

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,060
differential neural attacks on morons of

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,780
specs 3264 we found that the previous

40
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,239
differential neural attack is not

41
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,720
optimal by enhancing it the 12 round

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,739
attack can be improved and moreover a

43
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,500
practical key recovery attack on certain

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,800
rounds can be achieved

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,180
accordingly differential neural recruit

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,599
analysis has small potential than its

47
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,940
initially exhibited

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,060
the master developed to enhance the

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,599
attack on its classical components

50
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,720
specifically there are applications of

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,060
generalized the neutral bits

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,819
neutral bits can be used to generate a

53
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,459
structure of data pairs from a single

54
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,340
pair and the confirm or do not conform

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,739
to the prepended classical differential

56
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,180
together

57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,900
thus they can effectively boost the weak

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,080
signal from the distinguisher

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,780
for this we found the simultaneous

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,760
neutral B States

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,580
the conditional simultaneous neutral bit

62
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,720
size

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,780
and switching leads for adjoining

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,760
differentials

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,580
this neutral bits are not intrinsically

66
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,220
linked to neural network-based

67
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,780
cryptanalysis

68
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,599
but I expected to be useful for

69
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,480
converting a better range of weak

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,480
distinguishers to competitive key

71
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,060
recovery attacks

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,180
to answer the second question we produce

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
various neural distinguishers around

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,900
reduced statements 3264 and provided

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,480
comparisons with their full differential

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,780
distribution table based counterparts

77
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,260
the comparison results show that I run

78
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,680
new distinguishers

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,519
accepting values of the safer taxpayers

80
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,159
achieve similar but weaker

81
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,640
classification accuracies than are minus

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,060
one round ddt-based distinguishers

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,260
we conjecture that I runs and these that

84
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,680
accept values of safer text pairs could

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,978
decrypt one and keep wrong and try to

86
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,199
learn the four are minus one round

87
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,620
output different distributions but fail

88
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,380
to learn more features beyond the

89
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,560
distribution of differences

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,840
it says using the differential

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,840
neurocrypt analysis framework the device

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,139
practical key recovery attacks covering

93
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,080
16 rounds

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,660
this indicates that differential neural

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,259
analysis should work in General on

96
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,800
Modern ciphers however their advantages

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,740
might be easier to show and suffers

98
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,860
whose differential like properties

99
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,800
cannot be accurately evaluated using

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,380
existing tools

101
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,880
thanks for your attention
