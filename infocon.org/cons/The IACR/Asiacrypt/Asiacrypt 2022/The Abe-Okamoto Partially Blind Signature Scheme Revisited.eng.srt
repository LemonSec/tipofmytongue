00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
hello welcome to the short video

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,020
presentation about the paper the other

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,120
okamoto partially blind signature scheme

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,580
we visited my name is Julia Kastner and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,380
this is Joint work with Julian loss and

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,639
jayuk Zu

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,680
in this work we consider a partially

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,380
blind signature scheme which is

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,300
kind of like a blind signature scheme

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,420
just that the signer and the user share

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,900
a tag info which for example in the

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,000
context of electronic payments could be

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,859
a monetary value of the message

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,160
signature pairs or it could also be an

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,020
expiration date

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,800
so the signer has a secret key and the

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,739
user has the corresponding public key

18
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,800
and they interact

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,020
in order to get a signature on the

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,120
message on the user side so the user

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
wants a signature on his message

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
and we consider a three move partially

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,840
blind signature scheme which means they

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,579
send back and forth in total three

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,879
messages

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,180
we want two security properties

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,820
so the First Security property is the

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,340
partial blindness this is supposed to

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,320
protect honest users from malicious

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,180
sinus

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,460
and informally we want that the signer

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,159
does not learn which message he's

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,740
signing during the signing protocol

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,119
more formally we have an

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,860
indistinguishability based property

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,140
where the signer gets to keep two

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,360
messages a public key and attack info

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
and then

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
the user gets to pick which message he

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,920
will use in which of the two

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,259
interactions they're now about to have

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,680
they then interact two times and in the

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,079
end if both interactions were successful

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,299
the signer gets to see the message

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,880
signature pairs that came out of it and

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,979
otherwise it only gets to see a special

47
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,979
error symbol bottom

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,200
uh the Sino is then supposed to tell

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,299
which message was used in which

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,920
interaction and wins the game if he

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,740
manages to do that

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,360
the other notion that we want is a

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,700
one-on-one forgeability so this is

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,440
supposed to protect an honest signer

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,140
from a malicious user

56
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,959
and in this case they interact many

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,160
times

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
and if they have interacted L times for

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,420
a given tag

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,480
of the user's Choice the user is not

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,819
supposed to be able to Output more than

62
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,440
L signatures

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,640
for that tag

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,500
the scheme we consider is the other

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,800
okamoto scheme this is basically an or

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,280
proof of two blind snore signatures so

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,920
we have on the sinus side and or proof

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,019
that the signer either knows this

69
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,300
discrete logarithm which is an exponent

70
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,500
x

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,620
or it knows the discrete logarithm of

72
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,040
this hash of the attack info

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
and on the user side we just do two

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,840
times the blinding as we would do in a

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
blind snore signature to obtain this

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,180
kind of or proof of two blind snore

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,720
signatures

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,099
the motivation for why we're looking

79
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,080
into this is that on the one hand it's

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
an efficient discrete logarithm-based

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
partially blind signature scheme

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,379
and there are many other schemes that

83
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,780
use this all-proof technique and as well

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,000
take inspiration from the proof by Aven

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,260
okamoto

86
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,780
examples of such schemes are for example

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,159
they um

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,900
scheme by other which is a

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,379
computationally blind signature scheme

90
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,140
the anonymous credential slide scheme

91
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,319
and also the recent lattice based blind

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,679
ore

93
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,940
and the proof strategy from the other

94
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,580
okamoto paper is of interest for other

95
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,019
schemes that use this all-proof

96
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,459
technique

97
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,340
so in this work we identified a gap in

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,959
the original or one more

99
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,060
unfortunatability proof

100
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,459
and we meant the Gap while achieving

101
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,760
similar bounds to the original work

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,879
if you're interested in finding out more

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,920
about this I hope you come to the talk

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,439
at the conference and also you can check

105
