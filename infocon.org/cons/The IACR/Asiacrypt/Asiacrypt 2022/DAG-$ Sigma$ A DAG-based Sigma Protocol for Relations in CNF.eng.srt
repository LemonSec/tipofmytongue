1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,500
we are going to introduce Vig Sigma a

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,200
dng based Sigma protocol for relations

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,420
in CNF

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,660
As We Know Sigma Protocols are popular

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,240
and are widely used the building block

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
in many cryptographic protocols

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,080
even a binary and the polynomial time

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,140
decidable relation are and an instance

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,119
XY belonging to r a sigma protocol is an

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,660
interactive protocol run by approval and

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,100
a verifier

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,760
and the joint execution a commitment a

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,800
challenge and the response are sent

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
intent by the poor and the verifier well

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,219
the challenge is randomly picked by the

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,000
verifier Sigma protocols for proving k

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,640
out or n partial knowledge is well

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,840
studied

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,660
a relation of K Auto M touch knowledge

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,719
can be informally expressed in this

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,899
junctive normal formula and we call it

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,619
complete kdf relations since the number

23
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,340
of Clauses is the binomial coefficient

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,680
Kom

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,140
it's natural to consider the extensions

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,320
or complete kdf relation first one is

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,439
incomplete KTM formulation the number of

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,659
the crosses of which are less than the

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,259
binomial coefficient Kon

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,560
secondly if we reverse the symbols or

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,680
logic end and logic or we get a relation

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,560
in conjunctive normal formula so we call

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,380
such relation KCF relations

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,780
these people maybe focuses on KCM

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,880
relations in the discrete logarithian

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
City

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,079
relations expressed in CNF are an

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,240
important question of relations in

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,140
practice

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,020
for example many Access Control policies

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,720
are naturally set in CNF and they have

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,939
been discounted in design

43
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,680
attribute-based encryption schemes in

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
addition the instance of the case set

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,899
program are expressed in CF

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,419
we also provide a potential application

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,300
here a startup company wants to shoot

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,239
investors a business plan which is about

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,580
building at least a shopping mall in

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,099
every key neighboring blocks they also

51
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,680
want to show it in a zero knowledgeable

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,440
way in order to avoid the business plan

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
being leaked you can find that the

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,840
relation is also in CNF

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
to the best on our knowledge we find the

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,480
following skins working for KCF

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,620
relations

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,519
the first one is the CDs 94 however it

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,260
may lead to Super polynomial

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,000
communication code

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,379
the second one is a cyclicity program

62
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,500
proposed by Abel it air

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
but is designed for non-inactive

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,220
technology proofs not stigma protocol

65
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,400
more importantly It seems impossible to

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,739
transform less skin into a standard

67
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,340
signal protocol so the cyclicity program

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,760
doesn't have this chances of Sigma

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
protocols therefore a coaching is

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
arranged naturally

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,780
is it possible to construct a more

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,260
efficient stigma protocol for KCF

73
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,720
relations this paper gives an

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,959
affirmative answer to this question in

75
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,180
the discrete logarithm setting the

76
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,280
contributions of this paper are listed

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,019
as follows

78
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,659
we firstly formally Define partial

79
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,120
knowledge for KCF relations

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,120
then we proposed a construction of a

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,120
sigma protocol for KCF relations in the

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,099
discrete low prison setting by

83
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,280
transforming the KCF relations to the

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,280
directed acyclic graphics

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
we call it dag Sigma protocol

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,500
secondly

87
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,099
as an extension we apply our dng stigma

88
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,739
protocols to construct stigma protocols

89
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,319
for incoming

90
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,580
kdnf relations

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,980
you can find the definition of

92
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,000
incomplete kdf relations in our paper

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,540
finally we provide an implementation of

94
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,019
our dag Sigma protocol based on elliptic

95
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,160
curve groups with Key signs of 512 bits

96
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,100
it shows that when proving the relations

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,280
in our experiment and combine it with

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,240
series 94 our dhg Sigma protocol saves

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,900
more than 95 communication costs and

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,080
more than 90 percent running time for

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,900
more details of our construction please

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,120
refer to the flow version of this paper

103
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,840
thank you
