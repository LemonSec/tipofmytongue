1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,920
foreign

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,399
foreign

3
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
foreign

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,520
first afternoon session of the last day

5
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
so we will have three talks in this

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,600
session

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,299
um the two will be outside and then one

8
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,640
will be online

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
so the first talk uh is a functional

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,860
encryption with secure KDC by fuyuki

11
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,000
Kata gawa and the real dish market and

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
we will give a talk

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,259
thank you for the introduction I'm very

14
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,780
happy to talk about our work functional

15
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,660
inclusion with City Academy racing

16
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,239
so here this is a short summary of our

17
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,940
work in this work we introduced the

18
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,599
notion of functional inclusion in if we

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,360
in short with secure key listing and the

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
single decorator from Fe and we also uh

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
propose how to achieve uh these new

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
Notions

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
uh let's start with reviewing the

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,180
classical Fe and its limitation

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,959
in Fe a setup algorithm generator Master

26
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,360
secret key and a key generation

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,040
algorithm takes the function f and uh

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,319
the master secret key and the output a

29
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,379
functional decoration key ska

30
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,459
in public TFE we at the encryption phase

31
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,120
we use uh are they the encryption

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,480
algorithm takes the public key and plain

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,060
text X and output the ciphertext of x

34
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,159
we need the master secret key for this

35
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,599
encryption

36
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,080
and if we have our function reduction

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,340
key SKF uh we can compute f of x from

38
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,620
ciphertext or plain text

39
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,540
this is classical Fe

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
e so the question is can we cancel the

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,040
power of functional regression keys

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,400
so

43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,220
uh if we receive a functional decline

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,000
key then we can compute f of x from the

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,480
ciphertext of X however so even if we

46
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,780
return a functional reduction key uh it

47
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
is meaningless because we can keep a

48
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,120
copy of function reduction key

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,299
so this is a big problem uh in a setting

50
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,900
where by the users frequently changes

51
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,040
like subscription model

52
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,360
and so in cryptography there is we can

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
implement the revocation mechanism in

54
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,379
subsetting

55
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,738
and in particular we have revocabulary

56
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,339
great it's done the answer is no

57
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,139
because uh it is not powerful because we

58
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,620
need to update all ciphatex to revoke a

59
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,120
functional decision key in the

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,220
vocabulary

61
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,180
we we encrypt huge data today so it is

62
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,340
very inefficient to update all sci-fi

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,720
texts

64
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,600
so even if we accept the in efficiency

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,000
there is still a fundamental problem

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,940
so the problem is we cannot prove we

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,120
delete something in classical setting so

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,759
we can update uh functional inclusion

69
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,520
cyphatics then a revoked function of the

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,740
function description key cannot compute

71
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,460
f of x anymore however

72
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,440
there is no guarantee that the order

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,259
ciphertext were properly deleted

74
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,840
if someone keep a copy of ciphertext

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,300
then the revoked functional detection

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,780
key still can compute f of x from copied

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,639
over the ciphatics

78
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,020
so this is a big problem

79
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,060
however in if we consider Quantum

80
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,000
setting uh the situation completely

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,199
changes

82
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,800
in general it is impossible to copy

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
unknown Quantum state

84
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,539
the no cloning theorem said that there

85
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,360
is no General procedure for copying

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
unknown Quantum States

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,100
by using this property we can achieve

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,380
hierarchy content money program copy

89
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,160
protection and include our cryptography

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,000
in addition uh

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,460
we can prove that we delete Quantum

92
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,639
State uh by using the uncertainty

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,639
principle by using this property we can

94
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,620
achieve secure software listing and

95
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,320
cryptography with secure deletion

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,900
so so this is the power of quantum

97
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,759
information

98
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,759
so in this work we focus on functional

99
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,520
inclusion and we introduce the notion of

100
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,940
Fe with secret releasing where we can

101
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,699
delete functional reduction keys and we

102
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,100
also introduce the notion of single

103
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,319
decorator functionality Zone where

104
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,720
functional decision keys are copy

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,139
protected

106
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,639
so uh in a free with secure racing the

107
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,199
big difference is a functional

108
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,720
decoration key is quantum state

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,419
and the key generation algorithm also

110
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,240
generate a verification key for each

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,940
functional Direction key

112
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,360
this verification key is either private

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,500
or public

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,460
in this work we consider

115
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,919
in this work all verification keys are

116
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,259
private

117
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,380
in addition uh we have two additional

118
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,620
algorithms or if we with sticky listing

119
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,440
one is certification algorithm and the

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,139
other is verification algorithm

121
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,539
the certification algorithm takes a

122
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,120
functional decision key and output the

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,440
certificate for for proving the duration

124
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,800
so uh we can generate a certificate for

125
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,020
deletion

126
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,660
the verification algorithm takes a

127
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,880
certificate and the verification key and

128
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,199
output it is valid or not

129
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,819
if the certificate is buried then uh the

130
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,560
function reduction key was securely

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,500
deleted and we can no longer obtain a

132
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,080
full bags from encryption of brain text

133
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,580
X

134
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,300
so this is if we executive thing

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,699
so now we consider the security again

136
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,819
for secretary functional encryption with

137
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,199
stick activity

138
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
in this game the the adversary output

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
the pair of challenge print text x0 and

140
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
X1 and the Challenger returned the

141
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
current ciphatics of x0 or X1 and the

142
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,620
other sorry try to guess the

143
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,419
collectively

144
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,879
during this game the adversary can send

145
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,699
the key queries the other was already

146
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,458
sent function f and the availability

147
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,339
bound n to the Challenger and the

148
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,659
Challenger Returns the functional

149
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,120
reduction key or function f

150
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,219
I will explain the meaning of the

151
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,880
availability band generator

152
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,459
we here we consider a private

153
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,440
verification so the other battery can

154
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,899
send the verification queries the others

155
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,240
are extend the certificate then the

156
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Challenger Returns the soft skate is

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,959
buried or not

158
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,019
so uh in the classical

159
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,740
sorry can send a key query F such that f

160
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,399
of x there is equal to F of X1 uh to

161
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,620
prevent the Caribbean poly bear Wing

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,519
however in this game the adversary can

163
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,459
send the function f such that f of x 0

164
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,060
is not equal to F of X1 if a certificate

165
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,360
for function f is varied because in that

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,459
case the functional regression key was

167
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,000
deleted

168
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
so we consider a secret key function

169
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
setting so the adversary can send the

170
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
encryption queries to the Challenger

171
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
then the Challenger Returns the ciphadex

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,620
and the other person you can send any

173
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,200
encryption queries before duration

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,420
uh this is the meaning of the

175
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,260
availability bound so if uh so before

176
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,240
the other sorry how to put the valid

177
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,100
certificate for function f the other

178
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
sorry can't send any encryption queries

179
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,640
after after the other sorry uh send uh

180
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,399
by the certificate whole F then the

181
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,500
other side you can send the uh

182
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,040
encryption quiz as many as it wants

183
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,940
this capture the uh that this security

184
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,880
game capture secure division because uh

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,320
if the other sorry still has the uh

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
the functional Direction key is not

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,980
directed then the other battery can

188
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,000
probably barely win the game

189
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,019
okay so uh let's uh I I explain briefly

190
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,140
explain the notion of a single decrypted

191
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,420
functional Activision the syntax of

192
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,940
single detected IP is almost the same as

193
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,760
the standard Fe except that function

194
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,459
detection key is a Quantum state

195
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,459
however unlike if he with sticker key

196
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,680
racing this premium does not have

197
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,300
explicit returning process we just

198
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,860
guarantee that the functional decision

199
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,980
key are copy protected

200
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,560
so uh the other in the security game of

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,899
single detector Fe the other battery is

202
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,459
given a functional decision key for

203
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,180
function f and output to possibly

204
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,899
entangle the pirate addiction programs

205
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,980
and a pair of printers

206
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,100
then we test this High rate detection

207
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
programs uh by sending challenge

208
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,940
cyphatics to each uh decoration program

209
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,200
so if both programs can correctly

210
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,680
distinguish the challenge cyphatics even

211
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,260
if the other was already output the

212
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,240
plain texture excellent such that a

213
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,680
holds x0 is not equal to F of X1 uh then

214
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,260
if the other battery can uh these two

215
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,880
programs cannot distinguish the

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,700
challenges ciphertext then we succeeded

217
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,880
in in in

218
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,640
prepending prepending preventing copying

219
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,060
uh function reduction key because if the

220
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,579
other three can succeed in copying

221
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,980
function detection key the adversary

222
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,380
Trivium

223
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,920
this is a singular functioning

224
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,100
okay so let's see how to achieve a

225
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,160
secret kfv with secure racing

226
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,940
and first I explain uh the building

227
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,839
block of our construction uh encryption

228
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,420
with satisfied duration this is a kind

229
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,000
of Dr of encryption with secretary

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
listing uh in this primitive encryption

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,100
algorithm is quantum and takes uh paint

232
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,880
extend and secret key how to put a

233
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Quantum Cipher text and the

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
corresponding verification key

235
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,079
and we also have directional algorithm

236
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,420
and verification algorithm the duration

237
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,700
algorithm takes the quantum ciphertext

238
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,920
and how to put the proof of derivation

239
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,220
it is a certificate for deletion and the

240
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,019
verification algorithm takes the

241
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,420
certificate and the verification key how

242
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,300
to put the certificate is varying or not

243
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,060
this now I explained the security notion

244
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,459
for certified duration for secret key

245
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,380
encryption the other was sorry how to

246
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,320
put the pair of challenge print text in

247
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,079
the random the Challenger returns a

248
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,600
challenge ciphertext of X there on the

249
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,899
X1

250
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
verification queries

251
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
and if a such bit for the challenge

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,779
ciphertext is buried then the Challenger

253
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,459
rebuild a secret key to the other sorry

254
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,800
and the adversary can also send the

255
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
encryption queries you see because this

256
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,940
is the secret key encryption set

257
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,760
so this captures the duration of

258
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,120
cyphatics because if the adversary still

259
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,480
has the challenge cyphatics then by

260
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
using secret key the adversary can

261
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,779
Premiere win this game

262
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,060
okay

263
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,880
and we can achieve this fantastic Pro

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,060
fantastic primitive by using uh Standard

265
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,459
Security encryption Rascal the secret

266
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,320
language

267
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,720
which is uh based on one function

268
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,519
now I explain how to achieve their

269
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,040
ability bound secret key Fe with

270
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,740
security Reason by using classical

271
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,040
bounded secret key functional encryption

272
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,360
and ske with secure certified duration

273
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,180
as a key generation phase we first

274
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,920
generate a classical functional

275
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
decoration key for function f and then

276
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,800
we encrypt this classical functional

277
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,440
reduction Key by using encryption with

278
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,060
satisfied duration

279
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,220
so our functional detection key is a

280
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,880
quantum ciphertext and the verification

281
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,820
key of SK with satellite duration is our

282
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,459
verification key

283
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:16,019
at the encryption we first encrypt pre

284
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,779
and text X by using classical secretary

285
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,740
functional encryption and we append the

286
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,320
secret key of ske start with certified

287
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,480
duration

288
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,820
uh this is our Quantum cyphatic oh no no

289
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,500
no classical cyphatic right

290
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,600
so uh the security behind our

291
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,459
construction is our sport

292
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,940
if we delete functional reduction key

293
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,820
this is the Quantum cyphatics of SK with

294
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,279
satellite direction if we delete this

295
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,220
Quantum cyber text before we given the

296
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,279
cipher text which include the secret key

297
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,160
of SK with satellite duration then we

298
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,360
cannot get a

299
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
so uh thanks to the security certified

300
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,720
duration of security of the SK with such

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,540
high duration even if the secret key of

302
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,839
SK with saturation is rebuild we have no

303
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,300
idea about the derivative function of

304
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,920
the equation key

305
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,760
however if we're given the ciphertext

306
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,920
before we delete the functional

307
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,320
Direction key then we can recover the

308
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,839
classical function of the action key so

309
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,360
uh we can only achieve zero availability

310
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,820
boundary

311
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,660
foreign

312
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,259
classical setting we can

313
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,579
obtain bounded Collision resistance

314
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,980
functional encryption from one bounded

315
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,639
scheme uh so it is natural to try to use

316
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,800
the known transformation technique

317
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,199
however we cannot apply the known

318
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,900
technique because our starting point is

319
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,819
derivative zero availability will keep

320
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,400
on the screen notice one boundary

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,459
so uh however uh uh there is the

322
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,059
observation if we relax the setting it

323
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,819
is uh we can achieve the inner ability

324
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,760
bound scheme uh in

325
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,319
more precisely

326
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,520
so if we consider we if we accept

327
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,440
stateful encryption and non-negligible

328
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
security bound

329
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,919
then we can achieve an availability

330
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,679
bound scheme in the static setting where

331
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,059
n is fixed at the setup phase

332
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,980
bound means uh the the security

333
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,100
advantage of the other sorry is one over

334
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,340
polynomial which is the is the

335
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,340
non-negligible

336
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,520
uh we call this security uh one over

337
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,460
Alpha security

338
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,120
um

339
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,760
however uh we want to remove this

340
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,140
Resurrection

341
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,700
so uh somehow we need to amplify the

342
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,600
security

343
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
uh and the improve improve the Security

344
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,900
Bank

345
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,320
so uh we transformed their ability bound

346
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,260
scheme uh into any availability bound

347
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,900
scheme with negligible security via a

348
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,580
future transformations

349
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,299
first we obtain any availability band

350
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,760
scheme with state three inclusion and

351
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,280
static small and over capital and

352
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,320
security by using simple parallel

353
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,820
replication

354
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,240
second we obtain an ability bound with

355
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,660
static negligible security by using set

356
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,240
homomorphic circuit sharing

357
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,480
and finally we obtain our goal in our

358
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,400
ability bound with negligible security

359
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,220
by using power adaptation with some

360
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,299
optimal some efficiency property

361
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,700
in this work we focus on the second

362
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,799
transformation because it is the most

363
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,380
interesting part so we omit the other

364
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,720
two uh to transformation in this talk

365
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
please see the paper for the video

366
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,059
and in the second transformation we use

367
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,000
the half security which is obtained by

368
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,559
We Set uh setting uh capital N to two

369
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,140
times smaller

370
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,740
in homologous sharing we can generate a

371
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,559
share of input X and the share of

372
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,000
function f

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,960
and from each here we can compute the

374
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,559
share of the output f of x by connecting

375
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,140
all shares of the alphabet we can

376
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,740
recover the output f of x

377
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,460
so and even if we are given uh all

378
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,679
shares of X and F except one share of

379
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,460
input X we cannot tell whether the

380
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,360
encoding comes come from x0 or X1

381
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,179
uh this is the homologous sharing

382
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,260
and we use the M instances of half a

383
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,280
secure scheme uh to to achieve our Fe

384
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,500
so by using if we we encrypt each year

385
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
and we also generate a functional

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,940
decision key for each set of function f

387
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,380
by the functionality of Fe we can uh

388
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,220
compute each share of the output by

389
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,120
using a chrome from each instance of Fe

390
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,360
and we can also recover f of x

391
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
and each Fe is half secure so at least

392
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,140
one instance of these M instances is

393
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,660
secure with probability probability one

394
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,000
minus one over two to the m

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,760
so uh

396
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,780
so

397
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,620
our scheme is secure and

398
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,679
the Security Bank is one over two to GM

399
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
which is negative

400
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,419
so this is the the high level overview

401
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,120
or second transformation

402
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,239
yeah

403
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,059
so and in the previous slide I explained

404
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,760
to explain our essential idea we use the

405
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,039
homologous secret sharing however this

406
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,160
primitive means the irw Assumption

407
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,400
um but in our actual construction we use

408
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
a weaker variant set homo secret sharing

409
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,039
which can be obtained from standard

410
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,159
one-way function so our construction is

411
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,900
based on one way functions

412
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,559
the construction to explain our idea

413
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,000
let me summarize my talk in this work we

414
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,679
presented the new Notions for functional

415
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,740
encryption if we with Curious Thing and

416
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,600
the single regulator Fe

417
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,360
we also proposed bounded Collision lead

418
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,880
Center secret key Fe with secure listing

419
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,559
from one functions

420
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,860
also I omit the construction uh we also

421
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,960
propose the collusion resistant single

422
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,539
public key functional language from

423
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,400
indistinguishability obstacion and

424
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,020
one-way functions

425
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,799
that's it thank you for your attention

426
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,799
foreign

427
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,980
for questions

428
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,700
any questions online

429
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,840
maybe I'll ask a simple one can you

430
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,760
comment on the possibility of getting

431
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,100
Maybe

432
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,039
uh public verification

433
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,220
uh yeah it is a very nice question so

434
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,600
yeah

435
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,720
uh I think it's possible under if we use

436
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,260
some stronger uh conjecture uh it is

437
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,080
known that we can achieve uh public

438
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,299
verification sorry about that but at

439
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,640
least we need a very strong assumption

440
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
or conjecture so it is open to achieve a

441
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,140
public meditation from standard

442
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,220
assumptions

443
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,919
let's see thank you yeah so let's thank

444
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,480
the speaker again thank you

445
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,760
foreign

446
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,729
[Music]

447
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,520
thank you for the introduction I'm

448
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,280
Kakashi and I will talk about this work

449
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,379
uh with tomoyuki

450
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,880
so

451
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,220
if you believe that quantum computers

452
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,539
are more powerful than classical

453
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,020
computers then it is in Azure to ask if

454
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,960
we can verify the correctness of content

455
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,320
computation by using classical computers

456
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,659
and it has been your long-standing open

457
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,940
problem in the field of quantum

458
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,780
computation and in 2018

459
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,240
Mahadev resolved this problem

460
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,820
affirmatively by using the AWS function

461
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,760
after Mahadev the Breakthrough there are

462
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,159
a lot of follow-up works like making

463
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,400
Mahadev protocol I mean the summit

464
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
amplification for the protocol and run

465
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,780
reduction or a non-interactive Devon

466
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,400
average version but my heart is protocol

467
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
will succinct augment much

468
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
and especially in this work we focus on

469
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,240
non-interactive day on average music for

470
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,679
qma

471
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,520
and here the qma is just a Quantum

472
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
version of NP or more precisory Ma

473
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,799
uh where the weakness and the

474
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,679
verification algorithm can be content

475
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,620
and I remark that even though we

476
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,500
consider such a Quantum language but we

477
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,840
still require the verification of the

478
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,939
music uh to be classical

479
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,559
and uh there are several words about

480
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,799
existing Works about classical music or

481
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,480
PMA and first I review work by allergic

482
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,059
guitar and uh

483
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,120
so in nivik we

484
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,400
intuitively need either interactive

485
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,740
protocol between approver and verifier

486
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,559
where uh prover can non-interactively

487
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,279
prove some statement is true in such a

488
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,200
way that verifier doesn't want anything

489
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,080
beyond the correctness of the statement

490
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,779
and it is easy to see that that is

491
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,940
impossible in the playing model and we

492
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
have to introduce some kind of setup

493
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,179
assumption and in this work I mean in

494
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,020
acdh20 they configure this kind of setup

495
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,900
where the trusted party first generator

496
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,659
correlated proven key and verification

497
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,679
key and send them to the approver and

498
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,140
fire respectively

499
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,559
and uh formally speaking we have to we

500
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,140
can require the protocol to satisfy

501
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,260
three properties completeness thousands

502
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,080
in their marriage at the usual and there

503
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,600
are a good thing of this protocol is

504
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,460
that this is based on standard

505
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,500
assumption which is the LW assumption

506
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
and also both the fit app and

507
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,720
verification algorithm are completely

508
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,620
classical on the other hand uh drawbacks

509
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,440
of this protocol is that it is in the

510
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
secret parameter model where the trusted

511
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,820
part you have to generate a correlated

512
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,220
proving key and verification key and

513
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,240
also it relies on random Oracle and also

514
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,460
it only satisfies computational

515
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,960
soundness and complications

516
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,600
and let me review another existing work

517
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,380
of classical Liberties for qma which is

518
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,960
by uh for a danger guitar

519
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,440
and in in their work they consider a

520
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
different kind of effective model and

521
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
namely so we consider some setup

522
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,480
algorithm that power receives a common

523
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,000
reference bring to both River and

524
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,659
re-fire and in addition to that verifier

525
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,059
has to send some Quantum information to

526
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,520
the plural as a pre-processing

527
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,640
and after the setup the approver can

528
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,460
non-interactively generate uh proof I

529
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,279
mean classical proof and the good thing

530
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,100
about this protocol is that education

531
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,620
standard assumption LW assumption in the

532
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,380
standard model and also the online

533
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,080
verification is practical

534
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,580
I mean online application means the the

535
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,140
verification after receiving the proof

536
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,480
Pi on the other hand

537
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,140
apparently the before I have to have to

538
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,940
have some content power because it has

539
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,520
to send Quantum information at the

540
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,279
processing phase and author again it

541
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,279
only satisfy computational sounds and

542
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,480
computation of the marriage

543
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,919
and the ultimate goal in this direction

544
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,220
is to contract classically verifying it

545
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,799
for qma in the theory model

546
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,820
aware the attractive setup only

547
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,760
generates a common string and just

548
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,260
publish it to everyone

549
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,679
and this is the idea model but

550
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,900
unfortunately uh there is no known

551
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,039
Construction

552
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,020
from standard assumption

553
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,720
and even with content verification

554
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,480
and there is one heuristic construction

555
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,620
of the genetic from obfuscation by about

556
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,799
taking malabota but we don't have a

557
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,340
security proof in the standard model

558
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,779
and uh

559
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,779
this problem is very challenging problem

560
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,159
so in this work uh other steps for this

561
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,860
goal we find a new trade-offs among

562
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,279
assumptions security and models for

563
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,020
graphically five minutes okay

564
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,659
and especially if we give three new

565
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,659
constructions of politically verified

566
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,080
organic perfume a uh with incomparable

567
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
pages and from now I will explain them

568
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,039
one by one

569
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,539
and the first construction looks like

570
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,299
this but for this construction we

571
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:01,740
configure uh set up where that generates

572
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,559
a Content proven key and the classical

573
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,020
verification key and send them to the

574
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,620
river amplifier respectively

575
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,039
and after the fit app the proof is

576
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,659
classic and also purification is

577
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,520
classical

578
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,380
and we proved that our

579
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,740
scheme started by both statistical

580
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,200
soundness and statistical knowledge

581
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,559
without assuming any assumption

582
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,779
now you might think that this is to be

583
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,960
true but actually this is possible

584
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,539
because of such a very strong set of

585
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,779
assumption uh where the Fed Up algorithm

586
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,299
generates the correlated content proven

587
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,000
key and verification key and afterwards

588
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,880
in such a fitting it is already known

589
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,059
that unconditionally secure a need for

590
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,399
NP is possible in the classical setting

591
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,399
and also in the content setting if we

592
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,659
allow the verifier to be content it is

593
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,659
it was already known that needed for Q a

594
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,360
in such a model but possible

595
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,559
so we can continue our contraction as a

596
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,240
variant of the

597
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,600
the protocol by bg20 where we replace

598
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,820
the content proof with classical proof

599
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,100
at the cost of making the proven key

600
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,059
content

601
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,299
an aerotic and contraction Works in this

602
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,740
kind of model and this model is actually

603
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,480
uh exactly the same as the model of

604
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,539
cvv20 if you remember so I will explain

605
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,480
that again so as the first setup

606
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,700
algorithm generates a common reference

607
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,159
string and that just distribute it to

608
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,440
both parties and in addition to that

609
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,340
provide generates a Content message

610
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,360
and we prove that our contraction is a

611
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,399
dual mode need under the elderly

612
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,279
assumption and that means that there

613
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,159
were two computationally

614
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,080
indistinguishable modes and the one of

615
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,600
the most is The Binding mode where

616
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,360
statistical samples and in the other

617
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,700
mode which is hiding mode the

618
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,919
statistical denial

619
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,140
and this is a strict Improvement of

620
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,159
dvd20 because this is exactly in the

621
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,020
same model based on exactly the same

622
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,720
assumption but they only proved

623
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
computational soundness and

624
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,860
computational average and they

625
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,679
explicitly mentioned it opened to make

626
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,620
either of them statistical and we

627
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,000
resolve this problem

628
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,260
Arafat contraction if in this model in

629
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,580
this model

630
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,779
uh

631
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,720
approver and verifier shared some

632
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,539
entangled content States as a setup and

633
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,360
we call it the Bell peer model and we

634
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,080
construct music for qma in touch mode

635
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,980
and this such unique was

636
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,000
was a open problem posed by Bruno and

637
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,600
this also result their open problem

638
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,640
and there are we show that our

639
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,039
construction classified computational

640
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,080
soundness and the computation of the

641
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,419
knowledge uh in the content run work

642
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,720
model

643
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,880
okay so these are three constructions

644
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,740
which we construct in this work and from

645
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,539
now I will briefly explain the

646
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,080
techniques

647
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,899
so before explaining our contraction let

648
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,960
me introduce some technical tool the

649
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,620
first is locally simulated state

650
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,019
and the support that you have we have

651
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,659
some State domain X and the weakness W

652
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,700
for some qma problem

653
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,679
then we can generate some special State

654
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,200
Quantum State called history

655
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,080
and we require the following two

656
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,919
property uh for history heat first there

657
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,980
is some verification algorithm and some

658
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,320
are for better with inverse polynomial

659
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,599
Gap

660
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,500
following first if x is the if instance

661
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,460
and verification takes uh the honest

662
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,339
regenerated history State then the

663
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:24,719
verification accepts with the

664
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,300
probability of lift Alpha on the other

665
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,239
hand are the thunderness if x is a no

666
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,199
instance then for any Quantum State Phi

667
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,659
Prime verification accept with

668
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,719
probability at most beta

669
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,460
and uh

670
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,219
as a third property of verification

671
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,060
algorithm measured at most three qubit

672
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,739
of the histories

673
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,960
we are seeing some constant and

674
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,239
especially in the paper C is said to be

675
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,619
five

676
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,680
another additional property we require

677
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,800
local simulatability which means that

678
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,780
any c qubit of a history State can be

679
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,660
efficiently simulated from X or without

680
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,359
using the weakness

681
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,540
and the work by Brother Band and the

682
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,760
gorilla uh constructed statue I showed

683
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
how to generate such a history State no

684
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,020
I mean locally simulated from any

685
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,820
statement and written pair of qma

686
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,300
problem

687
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,920
So based on such a locally simulator

688
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,520
history State they constructed needed

689
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,060
for qma in the secret parameter model at

690
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,079
followers

691
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,240
so let N be the length of the history

692
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,359
State and then the setup a rhythm first

693
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,920
generate n kit K1 to K N of quantum one

694
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,940
time part

695
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,900
then also choose sometimes with f of

696
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
side C which is supposed to be the

697
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,420
subset on which we find verification

698
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,339
algorithm measures

699
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:10,079
and then the setup algorithm send K1 or

700
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,980
or Keys K1 to K N to the proverb of The

701
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,700
Proven key and the only fans k i

702
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,220
corresponding to the subset s to the

703
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,680
fire of the verification key

704
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,480
then for proving some uh qma statement

705
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,079
the river first generator history State

706
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,220
corresponding to X and W and then

707
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,740
encrypt this history state by using the

708
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,200
key of the content wanting path and

709
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,020
because uh proverb is encrypting content

710
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,760
stage for the five protective both

711
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,839
content and then the verifier decrypts

712
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,200
the correcting corresponding part

713
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,020
of their history state which respond to

714
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,680
the sub path and by recovering that part

715
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,200
of History state it can run the

716
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,880
verification of the history State

717
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,480
because the subject f is defined to be

718
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,300
the set subset on which verification has

719
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,359
to measure the history

720
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,180
and it is easy to prove that this

721
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,760
contraction 35 completeness and

722
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,520
soundness by using those of the

723
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,119
verification algorithm of the uh history

724
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,640
of state and uh

725
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,859
there is only your inverse polygap but

726
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:31,079
that can be either Amplified by using

727
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,060
power application and through their

728
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,000
knowledge it also simply for from

729
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
locally local simulatability

730
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,579
and this is the starting point of our

731
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,359
path construction but uh our motivation

732
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,660
is to achieve classical verification but

733
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,460
apparently it is not practically

734
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,640
purifiable because proof proof itself is

735
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,299
content

736
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,740
and we want to make the communication uh

737
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,700
classical at least and uh for this goal

738
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,359
we rely on content reputation

739
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,820
so very roughly speaking content

740
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,579
teleportation is a technique to replace

741
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,920
some Quantum communication with

742
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,260
classical communication assuming that

743
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,900
the two-party shares them enter the

744
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,000
state from the beginning and so this is

745
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
exactly what we want to do so let's try

746
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,980
to apply Quantum interpretation to the

747
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,240
Broadband Construction

748
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,760
so the result it looks like this

749
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,579
so by using the quantum computation now

750
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,980
the communication between the proverb

751
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,380
and verifier becomes classical

752
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,619
on the other hand for using the content

753
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,800
teleportation we have to assume that the

754
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,020
approver and the fire shifts and

755
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,760
entangle State

756
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,300
so this means that verifier has to keep

757
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,240
some Quantum state to run this

758
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,460
verification protocol this means that

759
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,040
the verifier is still not completely

760
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,420
classical

761
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,260
and here we make another of the vision

762
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,440
we observe that the verification

763
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,619
algorithm of the history State actually

764
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,839
only performed measurements in the power

765
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,720
basis and this commutes with quantum

766
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,660
teleportation or more precisory if you

767
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,480
are familiar with quantum teleportation

768
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,599
recall that up for quantum teleportation

769
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,660
the receiver only has to correct power

770
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,060
errors so such a correction of power

771
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,480
error uh commute with measurements in

772
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,480
power basis so our idea is to let the

773
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,780
setup algorithm uh

774
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,200
do the measurement at the setup phase

775
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,720
and as a result the our first

776
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,359
construction looks like this so before

777
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,880
doing the quantum interpretation the

778
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,839
algorithm first measure the provided

779
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,839
half of the of the entangle state to get

780
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,040
some measurement outcome and this

781
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,920
outcome is used as a verification key so

782
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,640
as a result the fire now becomes

783
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,520
completely classical and this is our

784
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,060
first Construction

785
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,820
next I briefly explained the idea for

786
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,160
our second construction and second

787
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,260
contraction is based on the first

788
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,180
construction and here I describe fast

789
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,119
contraction and uh for the First

790
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,579
Security of the first Construction

791
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,320
the following two properties are

792
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,400
important

793
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,579
first profanity

794
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:44,220
p i mean proverb should not know the

795
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,280
subset F and second for their marriage

796
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,420
property verifier should not know k i

797
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,540
for I that doesn't belong to f

798
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,960
and uh in the first contraction we

799
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,480
ensure this property by relying on

800
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,359
traffic setup but uh

801
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,960
it is easy to see that this property I

802
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,720
mean this can be actually

803
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,119
exactly what can be achieved by using

804
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,060
oblivious transfer so our idea is to

805
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,520
Simply replace the correlated key

806
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,760
generation with the original

807
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,359
and uh especially by using dual mode

808
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,960
probably be a transfer a based on lwe or

809
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,560
we can get a drawer mode music

810
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,220
and this is our second contraction

811
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,040
and the arrow thread construction takes

812
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,680
a little bit different route but uh

813
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,980
basic idea is similar so whoever sounds

814
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,800
contraction we start from three round

815
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,040
public point of knowledge for qfa uh

816
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,619
where the first method is content and

817
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,200
this is also proposed by broadband and

818
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,520
Google

819
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,000
and uh the well-known technique to

820
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,700
convert three round protocol into don't

821
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,560
interactive protocol is the Fiat semi

822
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,740
transform however we have semi-transform

823
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,140
doesn't work if the first message is

824
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,320
content because in fiately transform we

825
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,480
have to Hash the first message to

826
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,280
generate the second message but we don't

827
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,880
have a good hash that takes your content

828
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,720
message

829
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,480
and that has to the thickened classical

830
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,839
message so we cannot directly apply

831
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,579
virtually transform

832
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,300
and our idea is again apply content

833
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,640
teleportation to make the first message

834
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,960
graphical

835
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,660
and by using Quantum interpretation now

836
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,300
the fourth method becomes classical so

837
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,560
we can simply apply Fiat Shamir and uh

838
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,800
and uh we can rely on the known

839
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,780
technique in the quantum random model to

840
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,420
prove this is indeed secure network and

841
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,400
because we are now using content

842
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,740
reportation so we have to assume that

843
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,520
the

844
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,599
this is why our construction is in the

845
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,579
building

846
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,740
and this is the summary and this is a

847
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,780
comparison table among classically

848
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,900
verifiable needs for GMA

849
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,839
and uh remaining very important open

850
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,200
program is again uh Contracting music

851
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,260
for qma in the theory model from

852
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,319
standard assumptions and even with even

853
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,619
with content gratification this is a

854
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,420
very difficult problem and this is a

855
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,640
very important problem and that's it

856
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,779
thank you for your attention

857
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,119
foreign

858
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,220
thanks for the talk so

859
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,560
um for the third construction the

860
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,599
security assumption is the Quran does

861
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,220
this mean and the security is

862
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,400
computational does this mean there is a

863
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,220
bound also on the runtime of the

864
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,640
adversary or only the number of queries

865
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,839
is bounded

866
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:26,520
thank you for the question this only

867
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,380
bounds the number of queries

868
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,040
thank you

869
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,940
any more questions

870
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,500
okay so let's thanks Takashi

871
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,339
so the third talk is uh given online

872
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,380
foreign

873
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,000
[Music]

874
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:28,500
and Jen will give the talk

875
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,960
all right

876
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,339
okay uh can you hear me

877
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,500
yeah thanks for the introduction

878
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,740
uh good afternoon everyone and the title

879
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,440
my talk today is General properties of

880
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,619
one bit commitments I'm jinyan from

881
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,400
China university

882
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,300
so A Story begins with since our world

883
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,640
is quantum we can ask the following

884
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,140
motivating question

885
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,540
can we Face unconditional Quantum

886
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,300
cryptography solely on principles of

887
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,520
quantum mechanics

888
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,859
uh Stephen wissner might be the first

889
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,400
person to explore this possibility back

890
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,000
in early 1970s he started a Quantum

891
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,180
money

892
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,460
inspired by business idea to bring

893
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,380
things ending with two different states

894
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,960
were intensively started in early days

895
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,240
of quantum cryptography

896
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,880
the first primitive is a Quantum key

897
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,980
distribution

898
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,880
and blessed and Burnet and Brussels the

899
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,400
independently Earth have developed the

900
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,040
two slightly different

901
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,339
uh Quantum key distribution distribution

902
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,160
protocol which was finally approved on

903
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,780
conditional secure

904
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,140
however at least unfortunate for Quantum

905
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,319
bit commitment or proposed schemes in

906
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:00,440
early 90s were finally broken

907
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,760
so

908
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,740
the possibility of quantum bit

909
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,260
commitment was finally settled in the

910
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,920
middle 90s Mayors and law and the child

911
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,220
independently have proved that a qpc is

912
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,420
impossible

913
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,180
at least a really big blow to ambitious

914
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,660
Quantum cryptographer since then QVC

915
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,339
seems that

916
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:26,280
are in a subsequent almost two decades

917
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,000
there were little progress studying qpc

918
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,240
until recently a Quantum bit commitment

919
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,900
and revised and also in the difficult

920
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,380
message that is we compromise to

921
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,900
introduce computational hardness as

922
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,380
starting computational qpc

923
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,140
this is ironically in contrast to the

924
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,540
original motivation of starting Quantum

925
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,540
cryptography unconditionally however

926
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,119
this is actually the starting point of

927
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,540
this work

928
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,900
so uh in this work we proposed to base

929
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,240
Quantum cryptography on computational

930
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,380
basis or qpc and all its two equivalent

931
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,500
complexity theoretic objects induced by

932
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,520
it

933
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,819
and I will not let several exciting and

934
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:20,339
some work somewhat surprising results

935
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,800
are obtained towards this research

936
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,040
Direction in this and subsequent work

937
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,099
so let me go into the detail

938
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,160
I will first introduce a canonical QBC

939
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,859
and it's two complexity theoretical

940
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,520
formulations

941
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,800
and we first refer to this two

942
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,220
complexity periodic objects the object

943
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,760
one is two examples of efficiently

944
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,099
generated Quantum States let us

945
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:53,160
statistical interest distance but

946
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,220
computationally indistinguishable

947
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,980
when we compare it with this classical

948
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,040
count part A namely two examples of

949
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,440
efficiently constructible probability

950
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,800
distributions let us display far but

951
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,339
computationally indistinguishable

952
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,520
uh total acts show that this classical

953
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,460
classical counterpart is equivalent to

954
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,500
one functions

955
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,079
and in turn so the random generator

956
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,720
so this first object can somehow read

957
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,359
its Quantum computational indisting

958
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:34,759
crucibility or pseudo randomness

959
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,400
and this object is also known as if EFI

960
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,020
in a subsequent work

961
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:47,339
now let's turn to the second object it

962
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:48,720
can be viewed as a computational

963
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,339
navigation of one man's theorem

964
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:54,440
consider at least two Quantum States

965
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,960
they are identical in a relation C but

966
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,540
different in a registered are

967
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,140
so one man's theorem ensures that like

968
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,200
this unitary U that can transform the

969
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,440
left state to the right state

970
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,079
here we impose some complexity

971
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,220
assumption that such U does not is not

972
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,480
efficiently realizable

973
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,900
so this gives the second object which we

974
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,960
just called woman it is two examples of

975
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,319
efficiently generated Quantum states

976
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,900
such that the reduced states are in the

977
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,420
emergency are statistic statistically

978
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,560
closed

979
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,020
but let us not exist efficiently

980
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,319
realizable U performing on register are

981
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,720
that transform the state from one

982
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,959
example to the state to from the other

983
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,800
so this second object uh can be read at

984
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,480
some complexity of transformation

985
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,260
so now we have the two complexity

986
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,660
theoretic objects that seem quite

987
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,900
different in nature EFI assumes no

988
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,480
Quantum polynomial time distinguisher

989
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,059
while one man assumes no Quantum

990
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:18,599
polynomial time Transformer

991
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,420
and the second result I will introduce

992
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,599
in this talk is EFI and woman are

993
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,339
equivalent that is EFI exists if and

994
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:33,020
only if woman exists

995
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,300
but how to relate these two objects

996
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,900
together after all it seems different in

997
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,319
nature

998
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,780
the answer is they can be unified with

999
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,240
canonical non-interactive Quantum bit

1000
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,720
commitment

1001
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,420
so let me illustrate the relations by

1002
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,339
this picture we have EFI and woman

1003
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:03,480
if you look closer at least EFI it is

1004
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,119
just actually canonical computationally

1005
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,960
hiding statistically binding qpc in

1006
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,440
disguise

1007
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,020
and similarly this woman is just a

1008
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,119
canonical statistical hiding

1009
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,160
computationally binding qpc in disguise

1010
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,520
so also in this work we that establish

1011
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,200
the equivalence between these two

1012
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,960
flavors of canonical qpc

1013
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,380
and in turn EFI and woman

1014
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,000
so seeing from cryptographic perspective

1015
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,300
we have two flavors of qpc

1016
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,880
while seeing from the complexity of the

1017
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,000
lack of perspective we have efy and

1018
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,240
women respectively

1019
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:57,300
oh sorry

1020
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,420
so I have not talked about the monitor

1021
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,040
qpc so let me introduce a

1022
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,339
for in Greater detail uh lucky they can

1023
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:09,980
be represented by

1024
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,800
q0q1 an example of polynomial time a

1025
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,079
uniformly generated unitary Quantum set

1026
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,819
pair

1027
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:21,960
to commit at bit B we perform QB on C

1028
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,260
and R that are initialized in all all

1029
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,160
the local bits

1030
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,380
in the commit stage I will just send the

1031
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,119
Regency to a receiver

1032
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,579
and in a reverse stage to open B we send

1033
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,059
the register R to the receiver

1034
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:45,660
who will perform the inverse of QP on

1035
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,079
scene R to check if date returned to all

1036
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,559
zero States if yes except a reject

1037
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,339
otherwise

1038
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:00,200
we note that it's opening it's canonical

1039
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,940
in a sense that it makes use of the

1040
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,760
reversibility of quantum computation to

1041
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,740
modify the standards computation in a

1042
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,819
commit stage

1043
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,359
one can compare it with its classical

1044
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,880
counterpart for classical canonical

1045
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,640
opening the center sense is random coins

1046
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,240
used in like mid-stage receiver who will

1047
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,059
check that this coins explained or are

1048
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,339
considered consistent with the sender's

1049
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:29,779
message in a commit stage

1050
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,619
so uh let me introduce the security of

1051
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:38,760
canonical QBC hiding is simple it just

1052
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,099
says the commitment to zero and

1053
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:44,940
commitment to one uh red Quantum States

1054
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,480
in a register C these two states are in

1055
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,680
this indistinguishable

1056
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,740
statistical or canonical or

1057
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,459
computational indistinguishable

1058
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,400
by its binding property which we call

1059
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,819
only depending states that any malicious

1060
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:08,760
standard cannot open only a zero

1061
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,359
commitment or one commitment at one or

1062
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,160
zero

1063
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,599
and we highlight that here A Center is

1064
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,000
honest in a community stage but can

1065
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,180
cheat uh deviate in arbitrary way then

1066
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,160
we will state and that's why we call it

1067
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,280
only

1068
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,920
formally for any unit radio may be

1069
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,839
unbounded or polynomial sites are

1070
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:34,940
bounded

1071
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,839
performance view or on Quantum State q02

1072
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,819
and the resulting state is almost

1073
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:46,579
orthogonal to Q100

1074
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:51,540
uh we know that either the hiding or The

1075
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,980
Binding properties should be

1076
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,740
computational and since the qpc is

1077
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,660
impossible unconditionally

1078
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,319
so we have two flavors of qpc with just

1079
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,319
one-sided statistical security either

1080
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,720
statistical hiding or statistical

1081
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,420
expanding

1082
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,240
so our second result can be received

1083
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,000
with stated as a canonical QBC is

1084
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,599
symmetric that is not canonical studies

1085
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:20,940
statistical height binding could be C

1086
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,140
exists if and only if canonical

1087
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:28,819
statistically hiding qpc exists

1088
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,680
okay so let me talk about a little bit

1089
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,680
of history about technological QBC it

1090
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,480
comes from the study of complete

1091
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,480
problems for Quantum statistical or

1092
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,700
perfect physical knowledge and more

1093
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,680
General Quantum impact interactive

1094
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,260
proofs

1095
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,319
initial study is initialized initialized

1096
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,839
by what then

1097
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,839
watches

1098
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,920
let's look at the complete problem for

1099
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,780
Quantum statistical their knowledge

1100
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,260
proof uh it is an example of polytime

1101
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,540
uniformly generated Quantum circuit pair

1102
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,740
to 0q1 and performing on scene R such

1103
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,440
that the change distance between low

1104
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,140
zero and the low one is at least two

1105
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,140
thirds this is four years instance

1106
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,540
while for no instance their choice

1107
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,339
distance is normally one-third

1108
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,280
we know that this is already gives an

1109
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,859
instance dependent statistically hiding

1110
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,140
and the statistical binding canonical

1111
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,859
QVC scheme after some polarization

1112
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:43,859
polarization

1113
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,400
okay uh this is a takeaway message I

1114
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,960
would like to send to you

1115
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,380
canonical QBC has two clean and simple

1116
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,440
to stick to State complexity theoretic

1117
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,900
formulations that turns out to be

1118
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,680
equivalent

1119
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:10,440
okay next let me talk about the

1120
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,079
complexity assumption in mini Cube grip

1121
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,420
and its relation with our work

1122
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,460
but in partly adults have identified

1123
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,119
five possible classical words and

1124
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:27,000
playing Led I believe in one of them but

1125
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,059
unfortunately we do not know which one

1126
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,480
in this work we focus on this mini Crypt

1127
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,559
world and we studied Quantum compat that

1128
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,859
is a mini qcrypt allowing both Quantum

1129
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:44,839
computation and communication

1130
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,140
in a classical Minicraft work a basic

1131
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,299
assumption is when we functions

1132
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:54,200
based on which we have a bunch of

1133
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,480
important Primitives list here

1134
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,040
by turning into the quantum counterpart

1135
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,920
mini Cube creeped besides what are

1136
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,460
limited left but one obscure we in

1137
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,220
addition have oblivious transfer and

1138
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,740
Quantum money

1139
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,099
but it is open what is the basic

1140
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:21,319
assumption in medical crease world

1141
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,140
they are already two candidates the

1142
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,839
first candidate candidate is natural and

1143
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,339
namely a Quantum secure when we

1144
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,400
functions and recent and more recently

1145
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,880
there is a second candidate namely a

1146
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,380
pseudo random Quantum States

1147
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,599
and we know that there is a black box

1148
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:47,119
separation between these two candidates

1149
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,599
in this work we propose yet another

1150
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,059
candidate for the basic assumption in

1151
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:56,880
medical Crypt it is actually a

1152
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,859
complexity assumption with three

1153
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:00,660
equivalent formulations

1154
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,480
the first is canonical Quantum bit

1155
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,059
commitment with one-sided statistical

1156
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:07,319
security

1157
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:11,040
the second is EFI can be read at the

1158
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,839
quantum equivalence of classical 1

1159
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,359
function or pseudo randomness

1160
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,200
and the third is woman can be with with

1161
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,140
the computational navigation of OMS

1162
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,558
theorem

1163
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:28,859
and uh but with the first result I will

1164
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:31,740
introduce this talk can allow us to

1165
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,160
close out this canonical world uh we

1166
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,079
prove that Quantum bit commitments

1167
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,380
exists if and only if canonical Quantum

1168
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,119
vitamin from bit commitments exist

1169
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,119
actually we prove the following a loud

1170
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,680
club theorem

1171
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,380
it states that if a Quantum bit

1172
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,780
commitment scheme is secure against the

1173
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,240
perfect purification attack or

1174
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,700
equivalently its purification is

1175
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,520
semi-owned is secure then it can be

1176
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,160
compressed into a scheme of economic

1177
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,119
form

1178
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,660
uh this this theorem proof is very

1179
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,480
simple but it has many impressive

1180
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,359
features which I do not have time to

1181
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,299
talk about in this talk element

1182
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,520
contribution technical contribution of

1183
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,780
this work is we studied security against

1184
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,940
purification attack for the purpose of

1185
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,900
application of this load clubs theorem

1186
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,720
which I skipped here due to the time

1187
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,899
limit

1188
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:40,220
uh you need to follow up follow-up work

1189
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,780
it allows us to close out this

1190
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,599
restriction for one-sided statistical

1191
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,740
security

1192
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,680
so seeing from this you can see that the

1193
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,020
quantum bit commitment this notion is

1194
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,619
very robust

1195
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,920
so there are several evidences or for

1196
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,339
reasons to support our proposal of

1197
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:07,319
basing a Quantum crypto on qpc

1198
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:10,799
the first is at just set the notion of

1199
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,040
QBC is very robust

1200
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,440
the second is the formulation of two

1201
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,079
equivalent complexity theoretic objects

1202
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:22,500
are clean and simple to State they are

1203
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,359
suitable to serve as a complexity

1204
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:25,559
assumption

1205
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:28,920
the third is EFI has a classical

1206
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,260
counterpart that that is well known

1207
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,260
equivalent to one-way functions

1208
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,460
the first is a qpc is weaker it can be

1209
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,920
constructed from both a Quantum scale

1210
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,500
when we functions and pseudo random

1211
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,839
Quantum States

1212
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,020
the fifth is that qpc is not only

1213
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,680
sufficient but also necessary for some

1214
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,480
important Primitives

1215
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,099
are including a Quantum material

1216
01:02:56,099 --> 01:03:00,859
knowledge and oblivious transfer

1217
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,059
in contrast it is Uncle Uncle unclear if

1218
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,579
when we functions or so so the random

1219
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,799
Quantum states are necessary for

1220
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,119
cryptographic applications

1221
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:21,059
so ah let me conclude my talk uh with

1222
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:24,420
these pictures uh we know that in other

1223
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,700
words we know that from Quantum scale 1

1224
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,000
functions and pseudonym Quantum Quantum

1225
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,720
States we can construct QBC or qpc of

1226
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,180
electronic form

1227
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,940
in this work we established these two

1228
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,339
equivalences namely the equivalence

1229
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,520
between qpc and qpc of the canonical

1230
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,160
form as well as the equivalence between

1231
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,200
two flavors of qpc

1232
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,059
so it implies that from at least two

1233
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:58,740
assumptions we can construct a canonical

1234
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,399
qpc

1235
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,640
and we also observe that two flavors of

1236
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,540
canonical QBC are equivalent to EFI and

1237
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,000
who are met

1238
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,780
and we propose to study all these bunch

1239
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,599
of equivalent objects at the basic

1240
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,940
complexity assumption in mini Cube

1241
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,240
clipped

1242
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:30,240
last let me mention some open problems

1243
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,079
that interests me most the first is can

1244
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,480
computational binding error of a

1245
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,420
canonical qpc be reduced say from one

1246
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,420
half or even inverse polynomial to be

1247
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,780
negligible where a parallel repetition

1248
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,940
now this question we got Quantum

1249
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,619
hardness amplification

1250
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:53,700
and I think it can be viewed as a

1251
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,280
amplification for one minutes in the

1252
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,740
classical world

1253
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,680
the second question is it is interesting

1254
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,520
explore whether QBC conversely imply

1255
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,700
through the random pseudo random Quantum

1256
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,059
states of any sort and in my opinion

1257
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:14,160
this can be viewed as a Quantum compact

1258
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,440
of a classical pseudonym generator

1259
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,500
and the third question is can qpc so at

1260
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,099
the foundation of Q crypto let it find

1261
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:29,940
more applications of qpc and show that

1262
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,299
many other cryptographic applications

1263
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:37,140
conversely imply QBC

1264
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:40,098
okay

1265
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,680
okay

1266
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,040
I do not have much time to talk about

1267
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,700
recent developments so let me stop here

1268
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,119
thanks for your listening

1269
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,079
foreign

1270
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,480
so actually we do have like five minutes

1271
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,700
left for the session so if you want you

1272
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,660
can maybe

1273
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,578
tell us about the last slides

1274
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,020
a lot this last slide you mean yes okay

1275
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:33,180
so uh so in this uh follow-up work they

1276
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,819
Explore More equivalence between Quantum

1277
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:39,420
crypto and the QBC and if I put more

1278
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,720
equivalent objects uh in this bucket we

1279
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,579
have shown that a bunch of equivalent

1280
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,380
objects

1281
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,520
and in this second paper a late floor

1282
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,260
yet another candidate complexity

1283
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,720
assumptions which they called when we

1284
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,599
State generator and it's open whether it

1285
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,520
is equivalent to a QBC

1286
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,819
is open okay but there are some recent

1287
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:08,220
progress towards this question

1288
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,339
and in this third paper I'll study a

1289
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:13,920
Quantum State Quantum State commitments

1290
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,280
they discovered a lot in my opinion

1291
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,119
rather surprising hiding Biden Duality

1292
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,559
which can explain symmetry for qpc is

1293
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:28,440
established in this paper from a higher

1294
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,299
level

1295
01:07:30,299 --> 01:07:33,539
and in its first paper inspired by

1296
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:35,960
equivalence between swapping and

1297
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,880
distinguishing they give a much more

1298
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,280
efficient compiler for the symmetry of

1299
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,059
QBC just using another single qubit you

1300
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,780
can see our paper our people use

1301
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:51,119
plural symmetry with a Quantum oblivious

1302
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,760
transfer which is very complex

1303
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,760
uh income in comparison

1304
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,799
finally uh this in this work uh Brasky

1305
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:04,799
explore cosmology and crypto by

1306
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,839
replacing the use of quantum skill one

1307
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:10,200
functions in previous study with its EFI

1308
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,299
or qpc and he established so that this

1309
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:19,020
cosmology and Cube crypto are equivalent

1310
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,899
let's sum

1311
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:25,020
exciting work just happened in September

1312
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:29,540
and October a bunch of people uploaded a

1313
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,198
online

1314
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,120
yeah

1315
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,299
okay thank you so let's thank again and

1316
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,700
all the speaker of the session again

1317
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,800
[Applause]
