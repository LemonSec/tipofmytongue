00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,200
welcome everybody to the second invited

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,420
Talk of the conference it gives me great

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,460
pleasure to introduce Professor Damian

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,340
steli uh Damian is a professor in the

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,320
department of computer science at ens

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,900
Leo he received his PhD from University

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,160
Nancy in 2005. he was a postdoc at the

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,439
University of Sydney and then a cnrs

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,980
researcher until 2012.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,980

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,460
which have recently been selected by

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,620

[Applause]

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,260
thank you shweta for the introduction

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,820
so first I'd like to thank the organizer

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,740
so booster the program chairs and the

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,659
general chairs so I had a very good week

27
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,799
boost with the papers and the

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,960
organization so thanks uh thanks to the

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,220
chairs

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,119
uh so um yeah I'm going to give a like a

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,180
talk on uh efficient latest based

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,240
encryption so first um so I didn't know

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,119
how to start the talk last week but then

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,780
uh I got uh like I got some help from uh

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,180
from the French president

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,960
uh so who tweeted like 10 days ago so he

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,939
he was visiting by Donna

38
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,920
during this visitor so it's uh so the

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,479
Tweet is in French but the explanation

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,680
is in English

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,720
uh during the visit he had a first

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,799
diplomatic post Quantum communication

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
between uh France and the US

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,979
and uh so I was I was puzzled by this

45
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,979
tweet not only by the by the reference

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,440
to metrics which I found a bit uh I

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,680
don't know uh but uh so I I wanted to

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,599
know what was inside what uh what was

49
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,239
used on uh for for this uh for this

50
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,360
communication and uh it turned out that

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,480
it was using a deletion for Signature

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
and a photo camera for uh for the for

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
the encryption

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,599
and uh so it was a it was it was just

55
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,180
like photo camera why why photo camera

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,459
uh rather than cable why why are you

57
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,580
spending effect of 12 uh what is the

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,160
underlying reason and uh and what came

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,500
to my mind is uh yeah maybe they want to

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
avoid algebraic like this season for

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,560
some reason

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,879
uh

63
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,739
uh but that also doesn't sound very

64
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,080
consistent because then why why deletion

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,239
now so which is also relying on

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,720
algebraic agencies so so in particular

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
for encryption uh there have been

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,340
conflicting messages about the use of

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,260
algebraic season and uh so yeah I'd like

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,140
to join this talk to have an overview of

71
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,540
what is known in terms of security and

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,640
assumptions

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
okay so uh so I'm going to talk I'm

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,500
going to start with Andrew

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,379
and then I talk about ring lwe and

76
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,720
modular double reconstruction so and

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,060
then I will wrap up with uh with some uh

78
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,379
uh open directions

79
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,659
that I find interesting

80
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,659
okay so uh let me recall the LG bike

81
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,980
setup

82
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,560
so we have to ring some so first there

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
is a polynomial ring R which is e of X

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,560
modulus and uh integer polynomials which

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,159
is Monique and irreducible

86
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,900
uh so it plays on the same role as the

87
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,659
integers so you instead of integers you

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,060
take your integer polynomial so and then

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,280
uh there is a remote queue version of

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,580
that ring RQ where Q is a small integer

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,379
uh larger than a two uh gzq of X but the

92
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,320
same polynomial fire and uh by default

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,620
in this talk I will use a fire as a

94
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,660
power as a power of two cyclotomic

95
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,880
polynomial which is x2z n plus one with

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,320
n a power of two

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,639
which seems just fine as far as We Know

98
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,160
uh okay so what do we need to know about

99
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,040
these rank some uh so these are rings we

100
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,979
can add and multiply

101
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,440
that are related to some deep algebraic

102
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,020
number Theory but I won't comment on it

103
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,320
too much during the talk

104
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,360
and what we also need now is a notion of

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,240
size of elements in the ringer and an

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,220
element of the ring is smaller of the

107
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,680
Ring are smaller if its coefficients

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
have smaller magnitudes or small

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,600
absolute values this is the coefficients

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,639
of the polynomial are integers and if

111
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,380
these integers are smaller than I

112
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,060
consider that the ring element is small

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
okay so the first insensation of a

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,100
public key encryption scheme from

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,440
algebraic lattices was from Andrew in

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,820
1996 and I want to insist on that data

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,520
so that's 25 years old now so this kind

118
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,360
of assumptions are not really new

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,979
in particular it's 10 years older than

120
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,060
lwe if you think of it

121
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,220
uh so the scheme is pretty simple

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
so I wanted to recall it here uh just to

123
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,419
to uh to to to Define precisely what we

124
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,560
are talking about

125
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,100
so kijena I sample two elements f and g

126
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
small in the ringer

127
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,300
and I Define f Prime to be three f plus

128
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,940
one but that's mostly uh like a cosmetic

129
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,720
uh version of iPhone uh just to mix a

130
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,280
decryption simpler

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
uh H is a ratio of the two polynomials

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,060
mad queue and then the public key is H

133
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,759
and the secret Keys is f Prime of iPhone

134
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,800
okay then then I have two versions of

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,220
encryption to the like historic version

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,199
which is providing some kind of

137
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,139
one-liners one-way encryption

138
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,259
so I sample s mode on and I output three

139
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,539
h s plus M uh where m is a random input

140
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,780
and the ncpa version which would be

141
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,479
sample s and e smaller and outputs three

142
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,259
times HS plus e plus the message but Q

143
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,900
so in both cases the ciphertext is just

144
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,979
an element mercury and to the Krypton

145
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,419
I multiply by F Prime but q and then I

146
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,220
notice that this is small mat q and then

147
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,960
I reduce much three

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,419
which should give me the message M and

149
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,880
if I also want to recover s once I have

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
Mr it is not too difficult

151
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,759
okay so in the next few side I will

152
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,860
concentrate on on key gen and the

153
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,259
one-way version of the encryption schema

154
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,560
so the entry problema is related to key

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,259
recovery so in the in the entry problem

156
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,280
we are given H which is G over F and uh

157
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,479
and there are two versions of the

158
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,060
problem so one one is uh the

159
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,520
distinguishing version or uh where we

160
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
want to distinguish G over F from

161
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,900
uniform and the other one is a search

162
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,060
version where a given H we want to

163
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,699
recover f and g or some awesome

164
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,919
multiplayer some small multiple of the

165
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,599
pair FG

166
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,280
so this is related to um to a latissa

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,319
Ella which is a set of pairs of elements

168
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,620
in R square such that f h minus G is

169
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,240
human Q

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
and now this object is quite Rich from

171
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
an algebraic perspective so it's it's

172
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,180
actually an R module of Rank 2 because

173
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,039
it's a subset of R2 and it subset a full

174
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,979
rank of R2 and uh and module means here

175
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,680
that it's stable under addition so if I

176
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
have two pairs that satisfy this

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,460
equation so some of the pairs are also

178
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,099
satisfy the equation and it's stable by

179
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,080
multiplication by scalar multiplication

180
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
by elements of r

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,940
so if I multiply a pair FG that

182
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,979
satisfies the equation by any element of

183
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,900
the ringer it still satisfies the

184
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,200
equation so it's it's a modular and

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,539
that's exactly the definition of a of a

186
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,299
module here uh it's also

187
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,399
I mean if you interpret the polynomial

188
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,060
sound as integers so you view a

189
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,040
polynomial with integer coefficients as

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,779
an integer as a vector of n integers

191
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,940
then you are living in a subset of Z to

192
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,839
the 2N and it's a z lattice so it's both

193
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,420
a module and the lattice

194
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,580
and it is special in the sense that it

195
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,800
contains a very short Vector F Prime and

196
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
G so if we have a h which is a ratio of

197
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,300
F Prime and G smaller than uh the this

198
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,519
module contains an exceptionally small

199
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,680
vector

200
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,140
okay and uh so and because it is both a

201
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,820
module and the lattice we call this a

202
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,540
modulation

203
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,720
okay so from a from an efficiency

204
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
perspective

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,459
first in terms of correctness or a small

206
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,700
cues of a season and uh and it quite it

207
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,220
can be quite limited I mean like 10 12

208
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,019
bits on

209
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,019
uh and the costs are of all known

210
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,240
attacks grow exponentially with the

211
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,640
degree of the Arena uh and at the same

212
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,380
time all the user operations are

213
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
quasilia in the degree of the range so

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,060
that means all operations are

215
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,500
quasi-linear and the security parameter

216
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,200
to encrypt a linear number of Beats we

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,360
pay a quasi linear timer and so on and

218
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,760
so forth so so it's it's kind of optimal

219
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,820
in terms of asymptotic efficiency

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,360
and and with practical parameters uh so

221
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,700
it's it's convenient because thanks to

222
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,740
the nist postponed standardization

223
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,320
process there have been many

224
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,420
instantiations of these schemes so we

225
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,060
have like very precise figures of uh of

226
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,120
uh instantiations of uh and true and

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,459
other variants uh other public key

228
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,660
encryption schemes that I'm going to

229
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,700
describe later

230
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,000
and uh and uh so it turns it turns out

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
that uh for reason form like uh security

232
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,660
uh equivalent to a uh to to Breaking uh

233
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,459
aes128

234
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,339
uh the public key is around one kilobyte

235
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,680
and so is the safer Tech Stone

236
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,320
so then the size is the fair because uh

237
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,720
some variants use different types of

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,120
assumption different types of noise uh

239
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,300
different types of uh security model and

240
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,640
so on but but the the easy order of

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,260
magnitude is about the same

242
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,700
okay so what do we have in terms of

243
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,380
security

244
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,200
so if you want to prove security of such

245
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,100
a natural scheme or a Varian zeroth

246
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,680
uh so the one-way CP security derives

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,200
from two uh from the harness of two

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,980
problems so first uh you would assume

249
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,620
that H looks uniform which is the entry

250
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,899
decision problem and that would allow

251
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,220
you to replace H by uh the the the the

252
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,040
age generated by key gender or uniform h

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
and once H is uniform you would assume

254
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,040
that uh the functions that takes S and M

255
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,339
are and outputs 3hs plus Emma is one way

256
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,120
uh okay and that looks uh

257
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,339
uh a bit like a ring Elder Village so

258
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,140
it's a it's a it's a variant of search

259
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,120
wringle double

260
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,459
uh if you want to get rid of an

261
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,200
assumption we know how to get rid of the

262
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,279
first one

263
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,399
uh if you take FNG of magnitude about

264
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,300
square root Q uh then I proved uh about

265
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
10 years ago with one steinfelder is

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
that H in that case is actually

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,279
statistically close to uniforma so the

268
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,399
first assumption holds unconditionally

269
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,339
uh but there is a downside to it so in

270
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,279
that if you try to set parameters for

271
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,820
such a large uh choices of f and g then

272
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,339
uh entry encrypt becomes significantly

273
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,940
less efficient

274
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
so what do we know in terms of attack

275
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
some

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,640
uh so there are several parameter

277
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,040
regimes because you can choose Q you can

278
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
choose n you can choose the magnitudes

279
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,839
of f and g

280
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,079
uh so for

281
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,639
cubely and uh and FNG uh like smaller

282
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,680
than Squad few either of the forms

283
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,200
called Q divided by poly or f and g

284
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,279
constant

285
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,399
uh the attacks are are not much better

286
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,040
are either exponential in the degree or

287
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,899
not much better than exponential in the

288
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,180
degree so if if f and g are constant

289
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,519
there is an attack by krushner and Fook

290
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,920
uh which is adapted from the bkw

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,560
algorithm which neuroistic

292
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,700
UST eurosticket uh

293
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,820
exponential and over log Lagana

294
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,579
if you take a larger queue

295
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,820
then different things can happen or if

296
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,980
you take different fngs on different

297
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,839
magnitudes for f and g

298
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,000
if f and g are constant

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,300
then uh lettuce algorithms are perform

300
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,360
far better than usual

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,940
and and these are instances of and true

302
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,339
with Q large and FNG constant should be

303
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,160
considered weak

304
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,060
uh

305
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,160
if you is really too large like 2 to the

306
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
square root 10 hours and it becomes

307
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,500
polytimer

308
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,620
uh whereas if f and g are just below

309
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,339
Sprout Q uh then we don't know anything

310
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,279
special the the best known attacks are

311
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,680
still uh have caused a goal like

312
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,359
exponentially in the dimension

313
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,099
okay so let me move on to ring LW

314
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,200
uh so searching lwe uh was it was

315
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,060
introduced in the paper that I

316
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,420
co-thought at Asia crypto uh 13 years

317
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,620
ago with one Steinfeld uh Tanaka and

318
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,300
shagawa

319
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
uh and the problem is defined based on

320
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,339
the on the distribution or

321
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,180
so we have a secret s in RQ

322
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,000
and uh and uh and the distribution is as

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,120
follows we sample AI uniform in RQ EI is

324
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,180
small in the ringer bi which is AI times

325
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,459
S Plus EI yeah in the ring and then we

326
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,079
output aib area

327
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,440
and the problem is uh to recover s

328
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,139
from arbitrary many samples from Mouse

329
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,820
is distribution

330
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,940
so it's a search problem and uh it's

331
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,579
it's quite related to uh to the one when

332
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,060
s of Andrew

333
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,180
uh and in 2010 or uh Dubai

334
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,860
introduced the decision version of that

335
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,760
problem

336
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,740
where the goal is to distinguish between

337
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,220
Oracle access to the DFS distribution

338
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,260
and the uniform distribution

339
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,320
and they also gave like a search to

340
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,940
decision reduction

341
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,620
uh

342
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,000
uh so if you if you think back about uh

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,060
entry and crypto searching LW gives you

344
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,360
the entering trips one one s whereas

345
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,279
decision ring LW gives you the Android

346
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,540
encrypting distinguishability

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,399
okay so how can we encrypt from uh from

348
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,820
ring LW

349
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,160
so this encryption schema is based on

350
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
the on the

351
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,779
general framework introduced by

352
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,120
uberships

353
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,920
in 2009 or uh very often in the

354
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,279
literature it's it's referred to as a

355
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,300
diffie-hellman-like encryption because

356
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,779
it's really uh looking like a DC Hellman

357
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,899
but additive and with noise on foreign

358
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,399
so it's an instance of ring lwa with a

359
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,980
small s and smoothly than to encrypt

360
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,579
them we glue together A and B so it's a

361
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,180
two by one uh one by two vector and we

362
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,459
multiply by a small T and we add some

363
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,279
noise F and it's exactly wringle w e

364
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,800
it's exactly like kijena but with a

365
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,500
twice Factor uh vector and looking uh

366
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,699
from the left and rather than looking

367
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,280
from the right so it's uh it essentially

368
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,559
is a transpose of kijena

369
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,280
and to this sound t a b plus Alpha we

370
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,199
are down in the most significant bit so

371
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,240
uh the the message that we want to

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,319
encrypt on

373
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,900
and then decryption is essentially just

374
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,619
a vector product an inner product on so

375
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,780
if we inner product C the cipher text

376
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,080
with a vector s and one then we recover

377
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,900
something which is uh Q over two times

378
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,179
the message plus some noise or some

379
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,120
decryption noise and rounding gives the

380
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,219
uh gives a gives a message

381
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,980
so in terms of efficiency

382
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,500
so again I mean the best known attacks

383
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,539
are they have costs that grow uh

384
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,400
exponentially with a with a ring

385
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,640
Dimension all known all the algorithms

386
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,559
that have to be performed by the users

387
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,260
of course that grow quasi linearly with

388
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,059
uh with a ring dimension

389
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,840
so and uh with one in one step when we

390
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,600
encrypt on a number of bits which is

391
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,780
linear in the in the ring dimensional

392
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,700
all right

393
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,039
so asymptotically it's still a very

394
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,200
efficient when you look at it it looks

395
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,020
less efficient and untrue because in

396
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,179
particular the safer textile so now the

397
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,400
the public key has two elements instead

398
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
of one and the cipher text also has two

399
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,160
elements instead of one so it would seem

400
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
that in terms of space so it's uh it's

401
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,700
twice worse

402
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
it's actually not the case because uh

403
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,520
when you implement these the the first

404
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,580
element of the public Keys the ring

405
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,299
element a is only stored as a azucida

406
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,919
used to generate it on so you would

407
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,220
sample a cedar and then a user a hash

408
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,799
function to expand on the cedar to the

409
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,080
element a and uh and that's how you

410
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,840
would represent uh a so basically in the

411
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,020
key you only need to to represent D to

412
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,960
store B the rest is negligible

413
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,260
and uh and uh so it's almost one element

414
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,960
for the key and uh for when you encrypt

415
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,260
on uh if you look at the decryption

416
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,640
equation

417
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,320
uh most of the Beats of B are useless so

418
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,940
only the most significant beat sounds

419
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,400
with very few most significant bits are

420
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,799
useful to get decryption correctness so

421
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,020
when you encrypt them you wouldn't send

422
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,140
the full Cipher text so you would send a

423
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,080
full first half but the second half you

424
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,460
would only send the first the most

425
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,919
significant bits so it's also almost

426
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,440
just a ring a one ring element

427
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,679
and uh and if you look at the instant

428
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,620
stations are provided by uh by the

429
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,480
missed uh post Quantum uh

430
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,940
standardization process

431
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,940
uh then one one such sensation of this

432
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,340
scheme is new hotel which gives you

433
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,799
public key size and Cipher text size of

434
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,980
the same order as uh as the Andrew uh

435
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,380
instantiations that uh that I mentioned

436
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,039
earlier so for the comparison of photo

437
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,740
uh is about 10 times larger so photo

438
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,440
relies on lwe and not on an algebraic

439
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,140
decision so if you want to

440
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,740
to use a non-algebraic lattices compared

441
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,380
to uh to those uh ring LW base or

442
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,120
entry-based schemes and then you you pay

443
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,199
essentially effect obtaining

444
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
okay so now I want to focus on security

445
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,600
uh so ring LW is famous to have uh

446
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,120
because it it has a it has a famous

447
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,539
relationship with ideal SVP in the form

448
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,820
of a Quantum reduction

449
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,640
from ideal SVP to both search and

450
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,320
decision ring LW

451
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,260
so an ideal ideal SVP is just the

452
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,740
shortest Vector problem for a subset of

453
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,080
instant season where this subset

454
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,539
corresponds to ideologicism so what is

455
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,980
an ideal lattice

456
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,440
it's a module of rank one

457
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,360
so it's a subset of r

458
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,559
which is stable now and the addition

459
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,320
which implies that it is a lattice and

460
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,539
it is also stable by scalar

461
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,820
multiplication by elements of r

462
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,220
so it's uh you can imagine this so it's

463
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,640
just like the Andrew Rank 2 module but

464
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,140
where you have only one coordinate

465
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,440
instead of two coordinates

466
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,159
uh so

467
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,380
and and here's this reduction now uh is

468
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,720
also from worst case uh to average case

469
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
so meaning that if you can solve wrinkle

470
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
W uh which is an average case problem

471
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,059
then you can solve any instance of Ideal

472
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,539
SVP

473
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,178
um

474
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,400
okay so I have a couple of comments uh I

475
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,799
want to comment a little on uh on this

476
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,080
on this result

477
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
uh

478
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,700
so first is going only in One Direction

479
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,740
now

480
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,700
so it doesn't mean that uh if ideal SVP

481
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,280
was formed to be easy it doesn't mean

482
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,140
anything on ring LW

483
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,860
because uh you can always reduce an easy

484
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,100
problem to a hard one so that's uh

485
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,080
so you see in terms of uh attacks so if

486
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,840
if one has an attack on ideal sdp I mean

487
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,940
it it doesn't need to carry over to a

488
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,260
ring LW

489
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,500
so that the first observation

490
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,659
the second one

491
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,900
is that in terms of setting parameters

492
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,340
it's not uh so interesting

493
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,799
because uh so if you want to if you want

494
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,679
to set parameters against the best known

495
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,539
algorithms or the best known concrete

496
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,539
attacks against worst case ideal sdp and

497
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,620
then

498
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,140
you need to figure out how to customize

499
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,360
the best known attacks against ideal sdp

500
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,940
against worst case ideology which is not

501
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,640
uh which is not convenient I mean it's

502
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,360
uh to to to test algorithms so and and

503
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,580
to see uh how far they can go it's much

504
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,960
easier if you start from average case

505
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,720
instances on

506
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,460
uh so

507
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,679
in my opinion the main value of this uh

508
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,880
of this reduction are uh is that

509
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,140
uh ring lwe is in a sense General enough

510
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,200
to capture the whole uh hardness that

511
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,179
you can have in ideal SVP

512
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,620
so there is also a relationship to

513
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,100
Andrew Which is less known

514
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,020
uh which is of the form of a reduction

515
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,360
or from decision and true to search

516
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
angle w e so this uh this reduction you

517
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,980
can find in the

518
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,460
in the survey by Christopher curtain a

519
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,220
decade of lattice cryptography

520
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,539
uh

521
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,640
and I don't think it's been published uh

522
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,380
anywhere else

523
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,559
uh and the reduction is quite it's quite

524
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,820
Elementary

525
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,860
so in particular it shows that if you

526
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,020
can break her searching LW you can break

527
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,580
control so if if you can break uh ring

528
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,860
Elderberry based schemes you can also

529
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,260
break Andrew bass clips

530
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,260
uh so the reduction is as follows on so

531
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,539
you have an H in RQ and you want to

532
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,559
decide whether it's uh of the formal

533
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
G over f with G and F small

534
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,720
or uniform

535
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,900
and uh so this HR what you do is what

536
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,760
you do with it is the following so so to

537
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,159
to find out whether H is uniform or of

538
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,440
the entry form and you are allowed to

539
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
use a search angle double URL account

540
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
okay so what you do is to send if you

541
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
sample S and E small

542
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,360
and you create them uh so the the the

543
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,440
one sample of uh ring LW instance H H

544
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,720
times S Plus e

545
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,559
okay so if H H times S Plus e if H was

546
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,840
uniform then this is a true ring LW

547
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
sample

548
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,919
and if H was not uniform maybe it's not

549
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,480
a ring elderly sample

550
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,520
okay and then you send it to the ring LW

551
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,940
Oracle if it recovers on the answer then

552
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,299
you say uniforma and else you say enter

553
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,720
okay so first if H is uniform indeed now

554
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,179
the ring lwarkle will recover s on the

555
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,299
same s and uh and then the the output is

556
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,620
correct

557
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,419
what's more interesting to see is what

558
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,299
happens is H is a f of G or G over f

559
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,340
with a G and F small

560
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,320
uh and then you you can consider the

561
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,360
following equations so H times S Plus e

562
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,960
is can also be written as H times S Plus

563
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,640
F prime plus e minus G Prime

564
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,919
because the F Prime Times H cancels out

565
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,779
with the G Prime

566
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,200
so that means that the essence is not

567
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,679
properly defined when you send our HS

568
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,760
plus e

569
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,400
so it's undetermined so in particular

570
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,279
the ring lwr kernel is going to have a

571
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,080
hard time and figure out figuring out

572
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,320
whether it was HS plus e or HS plus f

573
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,140
plus e minus G prime or some variant of

574
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,779
it so with some probability it will make

575
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,200
a mistake

576
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,940
that means this was a natural instance

577
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,779
okay so what do we know in terms of a

578
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,400
taxon

579
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,580
so for ideal SVP uh

580
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,159
for polynomial approximation factors all

581
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,440
known attacks are still have a curse

582
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,240
that grows exponentially in the

583
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
dimension

584
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,960
uh

585
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,039
things uh become interesting from a

586
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,960
crypto analysis perspective when the

587
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,059
approximation Factor increases

588
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,900
and then uh we have a significantly

589
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,820
better attack than for SVP

590
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,620
um for Andrew

591
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,919
when the modulus is put in the Miola all

592
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,440
attacks are have Customs that grow

593
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,620
exponentially with the dimensional uh

594
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,500
and if Q is larger than this and f and g

595
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,200
are constant then lattice algorithms

596
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,480
perform far better than usual

597
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,659
for ring LW we don't have such uh

598
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,960
difficulties on so we don't have a like

599
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,159
a large regimes of parameters for which

600
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,659
such

601
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,000
uh degeneracies occur

602
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,860
and in fact ring LW if you try to

603
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,200
express it as a as a lattice problem of

604
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,340
our modules uh the only known way is to

605
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,880
do it uh results result in modules of

606
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,220
ranks strictly larger than one so we

607
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,260
don't know how to express ring LW as an

608
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,620
ideal that is problema uh in a way that

609
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,659
preserves the geometry and which would

610
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,919
make sense in terms of attraction

611
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,919
okay so now let me let me focus on the

612
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,880
on module LW

613
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,400
uh

614
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,640
because the date is longer so so it was

615
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,620
introduced in 2012

616
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,000
uh

617
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,240
in a paper that doesn't really focus on

618
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,860
the on the

619
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,960
on module elderly harness and it's a

620
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
it's an article by uh bakersky Gentry

621
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,820
and white which is very famous in the

622
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,279
fhe literature

623
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,039
and they wanted to have a framework that

624
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,059
captures both LW and ring lwe and the

625
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,120
Define uh what they call generalized LW

626
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,799
which is actually what is known to their

627
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,320
so it's it's a generalization of both LW

628
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
and ring LW

629
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
so it's also defined in terms of a

630
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,059
distribution so we have a secret s

631
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,900
which is not an RQ element but a vector

632
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,640
of RQ elements

633
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,940
and the distribution D of s is obtained

634
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,200
as follows so AI is now a vector of RQ

635
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,460
elements

636
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,940
yeah yeah it's a small noise

637
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,399
in the integer Arena and r

638
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,539
bi is AI in a product S Plus EI and then

639
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,820
you output aibi

640
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,200
okay and the Searcher would be find s

641
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,059
from arbitrary many samples from the

642
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,120
others and decision or consisting

643
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,220
distinguishing between G of s and the

644
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,659
uniform distribution

645
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,360
so if you take k equal one or you

646
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,779
recover exactly ring LW

647
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:58,020
if you take a naught equal one or the

648
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,120
degree of the ringer to be one then you

649
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,100
recover exactly LW

650
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,919
so it provides on the transition between

651
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,840
ring LW and LW

652
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,220
okay so again we can use this uh this

653
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,320
design by lubashevsky Palace once again

654
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,919
to encrypta from a module lwe

655
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,380
so it's very similar to what we did with

656
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,080
Ranger bubbly a little bit earlier

657
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,240
so for kitchen we generate an instance

658
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,120
of module LW so we have a matrix a which

659
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,580
is generated from the Cedar and then B

660
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,340
is minus a S Plus e where both S and E

661
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,760
are small vectors from the rhino

662
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
to encrypt on a message mu which has n

663
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,500
bit sum we glue together A and B the two

664
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,840
elements of the public key

665
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,399
and we sample a module LW sample on the

666
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,700
left in the form of T times a B plus f

667
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,399
plus to which we add and the most

668
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,960
significant bits at the right hand side

669
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,360
are the message

670
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
and then decryption is as before it's

671
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,159
just a linear product between the cipher

672
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,580
text and the vector essentially made up

673
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,460
of the the secret key and rounding it

674
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,100
so you have a quick remark on this

675
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,159
schema especially on the data it was

676
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,320
introduced

677
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,620
so if you follow the the nista

678
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,860
discussion so there was a an IP claimer

679
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,480
initiator property Claim by the CRS

680
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
based on the patent by gaboli and Aguila

681
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,620
melko

682
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,159
uh explaining that the patenta would

683
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,280
apply to kyber because uh

684
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,659
[Music]

685
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:48,659
it it looks similar but that patenta is

686
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,419
actually older than uh it's not older

687
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,100
it's uh it's it was filed down later

688
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,940
than than the publishing of

689
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,940
girlfriend

690
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,879
okay so in terms of sizeism

691
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,240
so it's what you get by using module LW

692
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,100
is quite similar as what you get with

693
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,380
Andrew and uh and ring LW

694
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,419
uh so one instantiation uh based on

695
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,399
modular double describer

696
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,440
and then you have public key and

697
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,080
ciphertext sizes or for similar security

698
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,140
levels that are of similar sizes so you

699
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,760
are still around one kilobyte

700
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,100
okay so what uh

701
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,140
what do we know about the relationship

702
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,539
between module LW and ring LW and

703
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,039
modulation

704
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,320
uh so there is a typo in the in the

705
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,260
title of the slider uh I'm not going to

706
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,299
talk about lwcia

707
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,659
so ring LW radio season to modulate the

708
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,820
value and that reduction is quite uh

709
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,279
Elementary

710
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,200
uh and result in the same modulus and

711
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,760
the same noise rate

712
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,140
uh

713
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,539
xenom

714
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,539
we also have a reduction from module lw2

715
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,760
ring LW

716
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,059
but the ring LW modulus is higher uh

717
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,700
with a similar noise rate again

718
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,220
and that reduction uh

719
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,100
is derived from an article by Albertson

720
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,240
deal

721
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,700
on the that was published at Asia Crypt

722
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,260
five years ago

723
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,500
so at a very high level now uh that

724
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,600
means that module LW and ring LW are

725
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,980
somewhat equivalent

726
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,059
if you look at concrete parameters on

727
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,220
for small modulus and reasonable noise

728
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,799
rates it could be that tring LW is a

729
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,320
harder than uh no it could be that

730
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,940
modular WWE is harder than ring

731
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,360
elderberry

732
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,860
they also exists the worst case to

733
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,039
average case reduction for module lwe

734
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,580
which by composition extends on to ring

735
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,040
LW

736
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,020
uh so from module sivp Frank K two

737
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,219
modular to module LW Frank k uh so that

738
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,418
means that

739
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,119
as sooner as there is a as there are

740
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,699
instances of modulus ivp of rankings

741
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,619
that are harder

742
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,619
in the worst case than modular WWE is

743
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,500
hard on average

744
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,780
so it's not so that means we can get rid

745
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,000
of ideologies because we don't need to

746
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,540
rely on uh modules of rank one or ideal

747
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,099
lattices we can actually have harness

748
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,599
that relies on

749
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,418
or modules of rank strictly larger than

750
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,359
one

751
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:55,260
uh and we can also Express module LW as

752
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,859
an instance of modulus ivp

753
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:01,380
meaning that contrary to the reduction

754
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,560
from ideal SVP to Wrangle w e so that

755
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,200
reduction was possibly looser because we

756
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,060
don't know how to express from LW as an

757
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,700
ideal SVP problem in the case of module

758
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,859
lwe that worst case to average case

759
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:16,200
reduction at a very high level now is

760
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,720
not doesn't have the same looseness

761
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,079
uh in particular module LW can be

762
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,900
expressed as a module sivp problem

763
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,660
so it's in a way modular library is the

764
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,899
average case version of modulus igp

765
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,960
okay so now I'm I'm going towards my uh

766
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,240
my conclusion

767
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,079
uh so I have a uh like a summary picture

768
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,940
so

769
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,220
I think this was my first scientific

770
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,400
talk in PowerPoint and uh usually I use

771
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,099
dmail and and then I gave up I gave up

772
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,619
with this slider I tried to do it uh and

773
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,480
then that was too much

774
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,720
uh so here you have the the tablet

775
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,899
version

776
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,680
so

777
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,400
so yeah so here I on this picture I have

778
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,640
a like a ring LW module LW ideal SVP and

779
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
modulus ivp

780
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,859
uh social roles are reductions so ideal

781
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:23,040
SVP reduces both to module sivp

782
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
and in the worst case uh domain in the

783
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
worst case range so the top of the

784
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,640
figure is worst case the bottom is

785
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,260
average case

786
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,500
so ideal sdp reduces to modulus ivpfrank

787
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,599
2 which are uses to modular size utfrank

788
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,400
3 and so on and so forth so these are

789
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,700
like almost treasure reductions

790
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,540
uh less trivial is uh what goes down

791
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,280
uh so worst case to average case

792
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,680
reduction so ideal sdp reduces to ring

793
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,980
LW modulus ivp of Rank 2 reduces to

794
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,720
modular double reference tool modular

795
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,520
size repair franc3 the radio system

796
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,760
module LW franc3 and so on

797
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,400
and you have inclusions also at the

798
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,400
bottom also from left to right these are

799
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,099
easy reduction so ring LW you can plug

800
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,380
in module awf and two you can plug in

801
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,839
modular Adobe effect three and so on the

802
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,900
backwards arose on on the bottom are

803
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,160
more difficult

804
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,160
so the background erosion at the bottom

805
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,300
are the

806
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,460
the

807
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,440
necessitate conditions on the modulus

808
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,800
and the noise rate

809
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,040
and in particular this implies that not

810
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,160
all of these arrows composer so when you

811
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,780
look at such a picture you have to be

812
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,440
very careful on a about the small prints

813
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,839
and and you cannot just take the arrows

814
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,240
and compose the reductions you have to

815
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,280
look at the precise conditions that you

816
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,140
need for the different parameters for

817
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,700
different uh for the different

818
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,359
reductions

819
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,480
um another comment that I want to make

820
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,500
is that in this picture uh so ideal SVP

821
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,040
seems isolated in a way because nothing

822
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,140
points back to Ideal SVP

823
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,560
uh who has a restaurant even if there

824
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
are restrictions on parameter all the

825
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,979
rest is somewhat connected

826
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,020
so there seems to be some kind of at

827
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,359
least on uh from what we know there seem

828
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,040
to be some kind of separation between

829
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,820
ideal sap and uh and the the module

830
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,560
stuff and like the modular double e

831
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,060
modulus ivp and ring LW

832
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,880
uh so in this picture there is a someone

833
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,400
important who is missing her uh so

834
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,480
Andrew

835
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,880
and that's a

836
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,040
that's one of the problems that I find

837
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,900
very interesting these days on

838
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,839
so to find the precise location of entry

839
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,160
in the picture

840
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
uh so in particular it's somewhere

841
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,380
around the dotted line

842
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,119
probably

843
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,480
at least as far as We Know

844
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,440
uh so

845
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,920
in the in a workout uh that we had with

846
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,339
Alice belimari last year at Asia Krypton

847
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,400
we gave two reductions on Entry so we

848
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
showed that ideal sdp reduces to search

849
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,780
and true

850
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,500
uh

851
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,000
we also showed them that uh

852
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
search and true reduces to decision and

853
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,300
true

854
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,280
but it's another variant of search and

855
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,619
tools so these two uh first boxes they

856
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,980
don't compose on so we have a

857
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,540
relationships between ideal SVP and

858
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,160
search and true and such and true and

859
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,920
decision and true but uh but the search

860
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,420
and truths are not exactly the same

861
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,740
um and we also know the decision and

862
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,820
true is no uh no harder than search

863
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,140
regularly so which is why uh

864
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,420
the conjecture that Andrew is around the

865
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,760
dotted line now uh makes sense now it's

866
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,160
it's

867
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,500
ideal sap is no harder than uh than

868
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,420
search and true and decision and true is

869
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,000
no others and self-trick and debris and

870
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,680
there is a suspicion that search and

871
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,440
true is equivalent to decision and true

872
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,140
even though this is another search and

873
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,400
chosen

874
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,760
uh another worker in that direction was

875
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,380
uh described Yesterday by Joanna

876
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,359
who essentially showed them that uh so

877
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,500
that work essentially shows that modular

878
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,619
uh that modulo ideal hdp

879
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,220
so if we work with an ideal svpr column

880
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,800
and true is essentially uh unique SVP

881
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,900
for Rank 2 modules

882
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,200
so which is a worst case problem also we

883
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,180
are looking at trying to modules for

884
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,619
which we have the promise that there

885
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,320
exists something uh unexpectedly shot in

886
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,420
it

887
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,119
uh so

888
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,160
again I mean that doesn't solve the

889
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,760
question of where Andrew lies on uh so

890
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,359
it's it's it gives a worst case uh uh

891
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,900
expression for and true which also lies

892
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,060
on the dotted line now uh most likely

893
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,160
it's somewhere between ideal sdp and

894
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,560
modulus IDP

895
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,300
uh

896
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,859
and and there are plenty of things

897
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,520
hidden essentially uh so the reductions

898
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,560
also have conditions therefore

899
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,079
parameters that are very large all the

900
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,300
reductions are very expensive

901
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,260
uh so there's plenty of of work that

902
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,240
remains to be done in this direction to

903
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,339
better understand the relationship

904
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,520
between and true and and the other uh

905
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,780
module problems

906
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,800
another kind of questions that I find

907
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,320
interesting is a choice of the ringer so

908
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,119
very often we choose this ring of X

909
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,119
which is x2z n plus one so it's most

910
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,920
convenient for implementation and for

911
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,020
analysis because for analysis we are

912
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,180
playing with psychotomics of powers of

913
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,099
degrees powers of two

914
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:05,040
uh for which we know plenty of things so

915
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,359
uh

916
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,880
and uh but but what is impacted by this

917
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,520
choice of fire so an interesting

918
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,060
direction is to find faisan for which uh

919
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:20,040
ring LW ideal SVP or and true are easier

920
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,640
and uh as far as I know we only have

921
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,200
very partial results in that direction

922
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,500
or find a Faison

923
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,020
so on the other side of five find

924
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,800
faizens that have interesting properties

925
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,099
for efficiency or functionality so is an

926
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,619
exclusion plus one the best five for

927
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,500
getting smaller ciphertext or can we use

928
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,660
other defining polynomials to get some

929
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,740
special functionalities

930
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,820
um

931
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,500
so

932
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,920
related to the first problem uh

933
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,380
there is this module product middle

934
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,599
product lwe

935
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,260
which is some kind of variant another

936
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,900
structured variant of LW

937
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,720
which we do not know how to nicely

938
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Express in terms of modules so it's kind

939
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,220
of a weird variant

940
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,540
uh

941
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,060
which I don't describe here but it has

942
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,619
the following properties that it still

943
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,540
allows on for asymptotically efficient

944
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,280
public encryption

945
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,160
even though in practice it's less uh

946
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,380
it's less it's less good

947
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,300
and it it is known to be noisier than

948
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,400
ring elderly for exponentially many

949
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,220
fires of degree energy so it's kind of

950
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,359
Hardcore for ring LW across the choice

951
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,400
of the defining polynomial

952
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,780
and this sum uh maybe can be viewed as a

953
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,440
first stepper

954
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,400
for finding a specific polynomial Phi

955
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,920
which would be hardcore for all the all

956
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,900
the polynomials for all the Rings

957
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,119
because if you get a reduction from

958
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,180
middle product at W2 ring LW so some

959
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,180
kind of reverse some reduction

960
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,680
if you get a reduction from middle

961
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,000
product a little bit to ring a little

962
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,460
bit for a specific fire then that means

963
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,220
that this version of finger library for

964
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,599
this polynomial

965
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,339
is harder as soon as ring LW is hard for

966
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,700
some polynomial file

967
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,579
if I had to better

968
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,780
I would go for Power of Two cyclotermics

969
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,640
but that's a very wild guess huh

970
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,780
okay and the last line of research that

971
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,180
uh that I find quite interesting in this

972
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,140
area

973
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,260
is a is a to look at this possibly

974
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,359
easier problem so ideal SVP and then

975
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,000
true so the only possibly easier because

976
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,560
we don't know reductions in the other

977
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,599
directions but if we look at

978
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,380
uh reasonable uh parameter settings so

979
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,780
these are still very hard so like Andrew

980
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,060
with a polynomial modular so ideal sdp

981
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,160
with polynomial approximation factors

982
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,599
uh as far as we know at this stage we

983
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,200
don't have a strong attacks on these or

984
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,619
strongers and generic latest attacks on

985
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,880
uh

986
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,980
so what can we do with these problems so

987
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,040
so can we use them to do interesting

988
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,079
things so instead of trying to attack

989
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,680
demo which we tried for quite some time

990
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,319
uh can we go look at the problem in the

991
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,359
other from another angle and try to use

992
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,560
this

993
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,960
like possibly weaker problems to have

994
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,359
interesting functionalities or

995
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
interesting efficiency

996
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,280
or or very efficient schemes

997
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,640
and the and the and the one recent uh

998
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,160
set of results in the direction was to

999
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,260
use the entry assumption for fhc

1000
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,280
construction so there was a two

1001
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,040
condition at uh at this Asia crypto to

1002
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,099
use a entry to get faster fhc

1003
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,099
and uh a concurrent work on the same

1004
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,000
topic at CCS so which which shows that

1005
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,940
uh maybe these problems they have some

1006
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,440
like efficiency advantages

1007
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,040
um

1008
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,400
okay so it's time to uh to conclude

1009
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,520
uh so thank you for your attention and

1010
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,800
if uh if you have questions I can take

1011
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,359
them now or offline

1012
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,700
we have plenty of time for questions

1013
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,119
yes

1014
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,720
foreign

1015
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,300
so thanks for the talk

1016
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,220
um how would you compare the security of

1017
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,180
the Ring LW sample and

1018
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,520
a module LW sample of the Sim size

1019
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,140
so so what do you mean by same size in

1020
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,760
the same with the same overall

1021
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,460
dimensional no I mean the the bit you

1022
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,880
need to represent them

1023
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,200
yeah okay so

1024
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,540
I'm trying to figure out the question

1025
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,579
because I I mean it's not uh it's not an

1026
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,260
easy question because uh representing

1027
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,520
the instance

1028
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,579
uh is already tricky because in a module

1029
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:45,960
like double instance you start with a

1030
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,420
vector of AIS

1031
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,960
so so this looks like bigger as an

1032
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,700
instance because you instead of having a

1033
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,339
single a you have a vector of ace

1034
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,859
but all this is stored with the cedar

1035
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:00,839
yeah so let's discussed so basically it

1036
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,060
was zero to represent at least as a

1037
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,180
fresh sample yeah just the CDs mode so

1038
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,099
okay so for use it would have the same

1039
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:09,480
sizeism

1040
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,839
yeah okay then I would say that uh

1041
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,839
module LW is uh is a stronger yeah

1042
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,700
stronger because uh because he so so if

1043
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,940
you write it as an LW instance with ring

1044
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,099
LW you you would have a secret of

1045
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:29,579
Dimension anal but with module awas and

1046
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,500
you have a secret of Dimension n times k

1047
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,940
yeah that's uh

1048
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,859
so it's it's

1049
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,339
possibly significantly harder

1050
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,599
okay thank you

1051
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,280
the questions

1052
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,859
all right then let's thank the speaker

1053
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,520
foreign
