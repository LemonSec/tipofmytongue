00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,080
hello welcome to this video if you are

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,780
interested in the state of Arts of a

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,679
perfect cake Explorer attack on crtrc or

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,500
you are curious about the key recovery

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,180
of crtrc using any one third MSP or LCP

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,119
of Planet key please join this talk on

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,220
this Friday

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,519
this joint work is titled or third base

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,159
or you need extended partial case for

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,520
Attack on crtrc with addictive exponent

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,000
blending

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,980
I will first introduce you the current

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,480
state of Arts of peakya attacks RC or

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,100
crtrc

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,020
without the exponent blending the

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,120
current state of Arts is the recent

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,399
Bureau crypto work

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,160
the authors managed to recover the full

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,980
key using only one third of

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,820
DP and the dpdq

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,360
and in this work we extend this to

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,060
a dataver experiment bending case and

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,580
this is the current state of Arts in

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,380
this regard

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,600
we also

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,320
can recover the full crtk using the

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,540
Blended

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,119
DP Prime and the DQ Prime

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,200
when sort of the msv or error speed bits

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,479
the principle of this uh extended

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,600
partial case for attack it's a two-step

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,040
approach

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,720
the first step is we try to find the 30k

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,000
constant K Prime

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,960
and for the MSB case we have two

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,299
scenarios the first scenarios we have

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,240
only one DQ Prime available then we just

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
do factoring we will factor a number at

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
the size of 1 6 of the

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,659
names of the models

41
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,759
and the second scenarios we have

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,880
multiple DQ primer available and then we

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,440
compute the gcd to get the K Prime

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,340
and that our speed case we are just

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,459
simply use copper space method to find

46
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,020
the roots of uh five arrays polynomial

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,920
to get K Prime

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,540
the second step we will use the

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,739
calculate the K Prime to estimate the

50
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,580
K Prime Times p and then we'll Factor n

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,440
using this estimate value to get p

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,400
in both MSB and the LCB cases which is

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,739
sort of the router value varied on a

54
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,319
normal to get the unknown part of a DP

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,540
Prime and then Factor n

56
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,860
in both cases for this step we can do in

57
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,940
a polynomial time

58
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
and in the end we will show you the

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
experimental results we have done we

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,700
used three different typical kinase and

61
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,180
the three uh typical blending Vector

62
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,739
that's

63
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,260
and in all those experiments we managed

64
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,920
to recover all the CRT case

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
using one sort of

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
MSB or RSB of a DP requirement DQ Prime

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,900
we also apply this uh extended

68
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,620
particularly attack to such an leakage

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,500
we will targeting the monogram ladder

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,580
implementation in our real life products

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,099
and we managed to

72
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,220
recover the flow key

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,799
using different learning

74
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,980
profile attack and it is extended

75
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,980
particularly thorough attack

76
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,500
if you're interested in this work please

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,280
join me in this up on this Friday see

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,640
you there
