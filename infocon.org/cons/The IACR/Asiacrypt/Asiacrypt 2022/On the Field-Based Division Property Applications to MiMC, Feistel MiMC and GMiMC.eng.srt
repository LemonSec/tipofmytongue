00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,060
hello everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,120
watching this video I'm jaminchwei and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,400
today I will briefly introduce our work

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,559
named on the field-based division

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,320
property applications to mimicy First

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,379
Tommy message and dreamy messy and it is

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,020
a joint work with Kai who mexiwang and

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,000
Wei

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
the main topic is symmetric key

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,980
Primitives that are efficient in several

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,320
applications like multi-party

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
competition for layer homomorphic

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,260
encryption and the zero knowledge proof

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,079
in this case the designers need to

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,960
reconsider which operations are costly

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,440
and which cost almost free and it is

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,660
quite different from usual symmetric

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,200
Primitives which are defined on binary

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,579
fields

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,760
new cost metrics like low number of

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,579
multiplications and low multiplicative

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,680
depths are designed

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,260
these Primitives usually work over large

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,459
binary extension Fields F2 to the end or

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,920
large Prime field

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,220
since the size of the field is large the

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,280
Xbox cannot be pre-computed or

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,159
pre-stored as in the traditional one

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,680
so they have a simple algebraic

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
representations like

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,860
power Maps X maps to x to the N or the

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,840
inverse of x

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
as a result these New Primitives are

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,220
often algebraically simple

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,720
since these Primitives can be

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,240
represented by simple algebraic

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,259
representations they are vulnerable to

38
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,360
algebraic attacks naturally

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,420
and attacks like group nerve business

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,820
attack and hire other differential

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,340
attacks have shown powerful against

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,680
these Primitives

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,979
we have group nerve basis attack on

44
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,799
drivers and Friday and high order

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,200
differential attacks on four round

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,600
mimicy and dreamy Missy

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,318
so a natural problem is how can we study

48
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
the algebraic representation of the

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,520
cipher

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,819
in this paper we focus on the polynomial

51
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,239
representation of ciphers over F2 to the

52
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,480
n first we propose General monomial

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
prediction and this technique is used to

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,780
detect the algebraic representation of

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,239
field-based ciphers by tracing the

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,420
so-called General monomial trials

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,300
it is an extension of division property

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,440
over binary field

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,660
by using this tool we propose a new

60
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,019
algorithm for degree evaluation based on

61
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,959
the link between Banner field and binary

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,019
extension field and we get tighter

63
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,599
algebraic degree balance

64
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,540
and we can no longer only rely on the

65
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,660
theoretic proof to estimate the

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,800
algebraic degree over infinite fields

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,540
we analyze the security of Minnesota

68
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,120
and dreaming message and present the

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
best high order differential

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
distinguisher and the zero sum

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
distinguisher for different different

72
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,379
instance to guarantee the security level

73
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,680
here is the results of our algorithm

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,260
for me missy we present the exact

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,560
algebraic degree when D is equal to 3

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,739
the same as the theoretical proof in the

77
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,540
recent paper

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,540
for first omimacy the previous only

79
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,599
attack for 83 rounds but we can attack

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,860
for 124 rounds and we can also give a

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,659
four round known key zero sum

82
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,519
distinguisher

83
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,340
for Jimmy C we'll search for all 50

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,400
rounds high order distinguisher for the

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,640
instance with block size 33 and 8

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,099
branches

87
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,680
this is a short summarization of our

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,900
paper and thank you for listening
