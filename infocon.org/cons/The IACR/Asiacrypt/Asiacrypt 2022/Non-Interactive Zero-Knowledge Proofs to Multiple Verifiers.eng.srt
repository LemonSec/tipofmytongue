hello everyone I'm Kang Yang from State

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,240
key laboratory of equipment this is a

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,820
general work with Xiao Wang from Lost

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,040
Western University our work is entitled

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,480
non-interactive download proof to

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,640
multiple real fast

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,680
their knowledge approved in apple

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,920
approval to comments are very far a

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,779
speedometer is true

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,199
here statement X is often represented by

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,439
a circuit W is called waitress in this

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
case xw satisfied amp relationship is

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,300
equivalent to CW is equal to zero ZK

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,660
proof is to satisfy three properties

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,000
completed this means

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,820
their verifier always accepts for our

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,620
answer execution

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,440
service means the malicious approver

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,500
cannot commence unless the very far a

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,320
fourth statement is true their learning

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,079
means the malicious verifier cannot know

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,899
any information except the statement is

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,260
true

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,240
allows the communication between

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,820
approval and the welfare to be

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,760
non-interactive

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,880
is publicly verifiable and approved can

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,040
be reduced to common multiple wave parts

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,799
the efficiency of United Care has been

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,500
significantly improved under different

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,400
Frameworks

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,159
designated welfare decade that is dbzk

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,500
is often and interactive protocol

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,460
between approval and Welfare

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,840
dvdk comments only one refer every time

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,000
dvdk can be constructed under different

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Frameworks

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,939
is non-interactive compared to an

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,240
executive dvdk has faster full-time

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,680
faster total times more memory button

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,959
requires linear very far time linear

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,120
proof Sun constant rounds of

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,000
communication therefore organization and

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,340
dvdk have different efficiency features

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,860
will attempt to explore the middle

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,099
ground between England and dvdk

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,980
particularly we study the efficiency of

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,260
Decay proofs when approval what two

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,020
common multiple verifiers that is the

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,879
end with the game

51
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,239
we allow the adversary to corrupt up to

52
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,720
T of the unwell first

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,060
unlesscrafted welfare conclude with the

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,319
approval

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,680
will focus on the kids T less than over

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
2.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,019
our goal is to design concretely

58
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,720
efficient msk proof achieving

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,239
significantly less communication than

60
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,239
running a dvdk proofs

61
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,640
having runs close to another case

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,340
reported streaming approves that obtain

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,800
small memory here

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,280
streaming of proof means the approval

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
can generate the understanding the proof

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,599
on the flight and the low part needs to

67
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,300
store the whole proof during the

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,940
per turquoise kyushi

69
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,400
we propose the three little concrete

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
invasioned MDK proof with a simple

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,220
property the first upper circle is the

72
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,260
information theoretic the other two

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,379
Protocols are computational security

74
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,140
there are two protocols in the city are

75
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,319
on Main protocols all our protocols is

76
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,659
only one round between the approval and

77
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,980
the very first

78
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,860
thus these Protocols are now interactive

79
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,760
that is their online key their protocols

80
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,519
in the CC team lead also one round

81
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,739
between their first we call them strong

82
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,200
online MD case proofs

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,780
they have two protocols in the same city

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,019
has six has a significantly less

85
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,959
communication than running antibi Decay

86
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,519
protocols

87
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,760
all our Protocols are simple and have

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,500
small memory

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,839
for computational complexity of

90
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,358
Protocols are linear to the circumstance

91
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,639
and the cheaper Ram debate our strong

92
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,979
MDK protocols keeps around among the

93
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,820
first unchanged on our strong online

94
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,699
military proofs also have an interesting

95
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,639
asymmetrical characteristic that is T

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,699
very first have sub-linear communication

97
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,979
and accompany lower resource mobile

98
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,139
devices

99
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,240
thanks for your attention if you have

100
