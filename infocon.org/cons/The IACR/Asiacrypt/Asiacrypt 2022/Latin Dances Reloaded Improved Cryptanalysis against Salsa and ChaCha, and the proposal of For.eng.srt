hello everyone my name is Juan grados I

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,520
am from I'm working in the Technology

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,500
Innovation Institute

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,280
and this work is a word

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,219
together with Murillo coutinho Yago

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,440
pasos Rafael Sosa and Fabio Borges

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,640
and Rafael Sosa work in the electrical

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,039
engineering department Technology

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,720
College in Brazil

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,239
works in the National Laboratory for

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,219
scientific Computing and petropolis

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,239
Brazil

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,440
this work has for Tyler Latin dance

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,160
reload Improvement cryptanalysis against

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,820
salsa and Cha-Cha and the proposal of

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,840
raw in this talk I'm going to present a

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,800
brief a brief introduction about

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,920
differential linear distinguisher and

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,579
probabilistic neutral bits attacks these

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,280
two attacks are basically

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,580
the the most powerful

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,659
against Cha-Cha and salsa as far we know

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,680
so after that we are going to see some

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,260
attacks that we did against salsa and

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,259
Cha-Cha also by using these two

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,780
techniques that I just mentioned

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,840
so we will see

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,299
a few techniques that we developed in

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,479
order to improve the linear power of the

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,939
differential linear distinguishers

31
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,659
and as we know this part is one of the

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,799
most

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,840
expensive in the differential linear

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,200
distinguishers correlations so with it's

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,040
an improvement here and we managed to

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,119
reduce

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,880
the complexity attacks

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,740
against Cha-Cha and salsa for Sunday

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,619
distinguishers and also for

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,880
um for the key recovery attack

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
s against

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,139
salsa so after that

43
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm going to present a new Cipher called

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,220
for raw

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,300
in this in this Cipher we will see how

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,500
we design the cipher and how is the

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
performance and the security of the

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,819
cipher

49
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,519
thanks a lot see you there in my talk
