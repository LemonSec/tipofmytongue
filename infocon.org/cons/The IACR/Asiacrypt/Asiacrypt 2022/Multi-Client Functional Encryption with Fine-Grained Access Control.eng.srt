1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
escape and in this short introduction

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,740
video I would like to introduce our talk

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,880
at extra creep 2022 on the paper title

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,840
multiplayer information encryption with

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,639
five grand asset control

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,799
so this is Jean's work with unified and

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,519
David basherman

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,900
so the main contacts of our paper is the

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,640
multiclan photography encryption

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
Paradigm or ncfe in the shop where there

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,380
are multiple clients

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,300
each of them is their own private

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,519
encryption key

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,159
so that again individually

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,040
and independently encrypt their data

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
under some diagram which can be used to

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,600
specify whether it has just stops them

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,360
moreover it exists an authority that

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
given a function description

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,280
can output a functional decryption key

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,660
so as to combine the clients psychedex

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
as long as they are under the same type

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,760
and obtain the functional Evolution on

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
the client's combinator

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,899
so this gives us some sort of control

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,540
over the information

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,100
revealed about the blendtecs

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,740
through the function evaluation

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,380
however one observation is that the

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,060
functional decryption key

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,240
once delivered to the recruiter

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
its usage can be limited

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,939
that's it the decrypter can use this key

34
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,520
in whatever way he wants

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,439
so this can be problematic in some

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,960
setting where the decrypter is malicious

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,619
himself

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
therefore we would like to have some

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,119
control over the decryption keys

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,020
and to do so their clients now at

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,400
encryption timer

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,280
to increase the data

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,079
with respect to some specified

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,079
attributes

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,899
and

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,880
The Authority is given not only the

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,340
function description but also some

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,899
policy to control the client's

49
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,439
attributes

50
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,060
for instance usually we imagine that the

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,439
militias

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,560
recruiter receives some functionality

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,980
which allows him to decrypt the clients

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,140
of attacks

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,840
later on the clients in the system want

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,319
to revoke these policies decryptor from

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,099
decrypting their Futures effects

58
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,099
they can do so by encrypting

59
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,340
the individual data under some different

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,080
attributes

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
which

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,099
as the valid with respect to some other

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,620
functional decryption key which can be

64
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,480
possessed by

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,900
always decryptos for example

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,640
so as to allow correct decryption

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
however

68
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,160
concerning the malicious cricketer as

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
soon as he tries

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,780
to decrypt

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,340
the newly

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,819
encrypted plan save attacks because they

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,160
exist

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,459
the attributes that will not satisfy

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,440
the embedded policy

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,900
of this adversary key

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,180
the decryption will not succeed

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,040
and first diversary cannot obtain the

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,000
functional Evolution anymore

80
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,640
therefore in some sense we have revoked

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,200
the malicious decrypton

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,819
so more generally in the paper we study

83
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,980
this problem of

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,239
multiple

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,739
glands

86
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,959
for functional encryption with firing

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,700
accept control

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,799
over the reduction key

89
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,480
so that

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,299
that decryption puts the function

91
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,700
evaluation only when

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,040
every client's attributes satisfy the

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,659
ability policy

94
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,159
otherwise

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,140
the description algorithm returns

96
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,760
nothing

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,580
in particular we focused on the function

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,099
class that are competing with the

99
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,440
products and the essential drone can be

100
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,879
expressed using linear security settings

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,860
schemes

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,340
so we propose mcfe candidates for inner

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,798
products with a second drone through our

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,940
SSS

105
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,978
achieving that active security random

106
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,899
Oracle model and linear to the

107
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,820
communication

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,400
this improves upon prior Works which

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,120
Focus either on single plane schemes or

110
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,360
had quadratic total communication

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
in the longer talk

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
detail more about the context

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
with comparisons to previous works

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,620
and highlight some technical ideas which

115
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,000
allows Earth

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,580
to achieve our results

117
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,440
thank you for your attention and see you

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,340
soon at lasercrypt
