00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,540
hello and welcome to the five minute

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,279
introductory talk for our paper

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,020
Universal ring signatures in the

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,500
standard model

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,639
first let's get into ring signatures

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,679
ring signatures are just signatures

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,299
where instead of using one key and

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,039
signing and verification you use a whole

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,260
ring of them and the security Notions

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,000
you get out of this are anonymity and

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,460
unfortability so for a verifying

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,080
signature you want to learn that someone

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,119
in that ring has made it but you don't

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
want to learn who exactly and the first

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,840
ever use case for this was

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,059
whistleblowing we will look into this

17
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,880
today so governments don't really like

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
with flowers and they do want to protect

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,379
themselves against them even willing to

20
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,520
punish them

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
and the setup for a whistleblower with

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,620
ring signatures is as follows an

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,440
employer wants to leak some data to a

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
journalist and the whole reason we want

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,879
signatures in this at all is they should

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,620
be able to prove that they have the

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,899
access to the kind of sensitive data

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,059
that they send and they're not just a

29
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,739
Reddit troll

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,539
first we assume that the employee

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,580
already has a public verification key

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,320
and a private signing key for example

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,380
for an RSA signing scheme in a first

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,040
step they will fix an anonymity ring by

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,900
including the public keys of other

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,580
people for example this might be

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,560
everybody working in their departments

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,900
and then in the Second Step they use

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,659
ring signature to sign anonymously

40
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,299
and sent the signature to the journalist

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,580
along with the leak the journalist then

42
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,580
knows that this is trustworthy data and

43
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,220
the anonymity is protected however

44
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,520
things are a bit complicated today

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
because there's not just one signing

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
scheme

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,259
and it's not quite clear if there are

48
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,540
ring signatures for every scheme and

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,640
especially if you add multiple different

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,040
schemes at the same time into a ring how

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,320
this would work there are some previous

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,899
results that uh

53
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,020
provide this for certain types of

54
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,540
schemes with a certain structure but not

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,820
for all of them so a clever government

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,880
might have the idea let's just forbid

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,399
all the schemes that allow for ring

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,780
signing at all

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,500
and the question we ask is is this a

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,720
potential protection so can you protect

61
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,660
yourself by using a certain scheme from

62
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,060
being used in anonymity ring and the

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,980
answer is no

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,739
some terms and conditions to apply and

65
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,620
you should come to my talk to learn more

66
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,980
about this but the basic result is that

67
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,080
we give a construction for Universal

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,540
ring signatures which solves precisely

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,879
that problem where you have to make a

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,840
key ring from any keys from any schemes

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,180
and in our constructions we do not use

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,519
the CRS because in this whole

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,739
whistleblowing thing you cannot assume

74
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,080
trust and we also don't use the random

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,819
Oracle and we will explain a little bit

76
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,800
more why in the full talk

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,560
however now for our constructions the

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,780
first one is actually using complexity

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,060
leveraging and

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,300
we need Super polynomial security for

81
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,160
the underlying signatures which is not

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,980
truly Universal so we fix this in our

83
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,739
next two constructions which are based

84
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,200
on witness encryption the first achieves

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
early linear size and then in the second

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,099
one we build a special witness

87
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,440
encryption using i o and we do get

88
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,920
logarithmic size but we do need i o also

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,440
another caveat is that we only get

90
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,900
anonymity if we get a certain threshold

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,480
of honest keys in our ring normally this

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,060
would be two for normal anonymity but in

93
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,180
our case we need three or four honest

94
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,560
keys

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
so for more details on our constructions

96
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,599
please come to our talk I will be very

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,619
pleased to see you there
