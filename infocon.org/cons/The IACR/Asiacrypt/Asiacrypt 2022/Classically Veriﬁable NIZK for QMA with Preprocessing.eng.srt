00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:04,080
hi I'm Takashi this is a short abstract

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,160
video for this work

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,139
non-interactive real marriage nivik is

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,240
the protocol to improve validity of some

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,460
statement without revealing anything

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,980
beyond its validity in a non-attractive

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,699
way

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,640
we require music to satisfy completeness

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
soundness and their knowledge property

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,220
it is easy to see that lyrics for

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,680
non-trivial languages are impossible in

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,439
the playing model so we have to rely on

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,680
some track and set up in this work we

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,500
focus analytics for qma with classical

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,520
verification here qma is the content

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,579
version of NP or M A or we are witness

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,760
and verification can be condemned even

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,559
though we consider such content

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,719
languages we require that the

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,520
verification can be done graphically

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,899
which is a highly non-trivial property

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,420
the ultimate goal is to construct

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,600
classically verifiable lyrics for qma in

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
the common reference string model

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,040
so first there's only a heuristic

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
contraction and no known construction

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,740
from standard assumptions thus existing

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,680
Works rely on stronger setup models than

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,080
the common referencing model the

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,659
motivation of this work is to find new

31
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,000
trade-offs among assumptions security

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
and models for classically Revival

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
musics for qma

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,340
in this verb we give three constructions

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,320
of classical review fire genetics for

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,860
qma with incomparable features I will

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,060
explain them one by one

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,799
the first contraction is in the content

39
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,340
secret parameter model in this model the

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,680
drafted party first sends a Content

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,659
proven key and classical verification

42
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,880
key to the further and verifier

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,380
respectively after the setup the program

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,700
non-interactively generate a classical

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,540
proof we proved that our contraction

46
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,579
32-5 both statistical soundness and

47
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,439
statistical view knowledge without

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,800
assuming any assumption not that this is

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
a variant of the navic by broadband and

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,540
griddle or where the proven key is

51
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,900
classical but the proof is content

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,780
the second construction only requires

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,640
the traffic fit app to generate your

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,459
common reference string but the fire has

55
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,980
to send some instant independent Quantum

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,459
information to the pluriver as a setup

57
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,340
after this setup the prerection

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,300
non-interactively generated classical

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,959
proof we show that our contraction has a

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,879
dual mode property under the LW

61
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,700
assumption that it there are two

62
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,680
computational indistinguishable modes

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
one is The Binding mode where it started

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
to find such statistical soundness and

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,180
the computational zero knowledge and the

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,340
other is the hiding mode where it

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,500
satisfied the computational was handlers

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,660
and the statistical knowledge

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,360
not that the mother and assumption are

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,940
exactly the same as those of Kola danger

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,640
Vedic and gen where they constructed

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,459
lyrics with computational soundness and

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,319
the computation of their knowledge

74
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,959
they left it open to make either of them

75
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,599
statistical and we solve this open

76
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,018
problem

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,760
the third contraction is in the Bell

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
pair model where the proverb and

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,580
verifier share entanglement as a setup

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
the better pair model is often regarded

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,019
as a Quantum analog of the common

82
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,519
reference string model

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,580
our construction satisfied computational

84
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,920
soundness and computational the marriage

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
in the content random worker model this

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,379
answers an open question of brother

87
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,019
banter and the guerrillo who asked if we

88
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,780
can contract nivex for qma in the very

89
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,319
pair model

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,239
this is a comparison table among

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,760
constructions of classical liver fiber

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,060
netix for qma for more detail please

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,760
attend my talk at aviacrypt thanks
