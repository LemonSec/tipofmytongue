00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hi everyone I am here in hanyang

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,839
University and I am going to talk about

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,200
our paper efficient generation argument

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
in discrete algorithm setting soap

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
operating probe or South Korea for fire

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
this paper is written by me and Samuel

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,460
Kim in Solomon University and Che

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,820
hongson in hanyang University

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,119
before introducing our contribution I

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,399
will briefly mentioned about inner

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
product argument in a product argument

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,520
is an ultimate of Neurology of two

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,879
vectors A and B for their inner product

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,379
relation

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,840
State schedule log based in a product

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,500
argument is proposed by bluetooth error

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,620
and optimized by Bunch error is known as

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,520
reference

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,180
in our products are not it used many

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,960
applications

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,619
argument for arithmetic circuits and

22
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,400
generative polynomial scheme

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,580
the props of inner product argument is

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,659
transparency no need trust is zero and

25
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,619
toxin prop site logarithmic size

26
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,280
the cons of no product argument is

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
expensive verification

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,780
in your size

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,220
our purpose of this work is to construct

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,540
more succinct prop size or efficient

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,299
purification no problems are not keeping

32
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,020
transparency

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,360
this is our contribution

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,840
we propose three transparent in a

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,659
paradox arguments first

36
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,119
named protocol 2

37
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
the parts in a product argument with

38
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,820
several ultimate probe size

39
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,759
or square root log n

40
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
from this protocol can get the first

41
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,379
transparent generous argument with o

42
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,160
squared vocal and prop size

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,720
second named protocol 3 the first in a

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,700
product argument with sub-reneurial

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,000
purifier under this screen logarithm

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
assumption

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
although the protocol use pairing

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,239
operation

49
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,239
each sound needs is based on standard

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,940
assumption

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,180
discrete Revolution assumption

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,379
rust named protocol introduced a noble

53
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,739
method to achieve the sublinear verifier

54
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,620
in the Prototype mode with the appearing

55
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,879
operation

56
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,840
with our variance of pairings which show

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,080
possibility of solving your verifier in

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,599
discrete level setting

59
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,540
now when explained details in complex

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,739
day I hope to see you all in Taiwan

61
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,400
thank you
