1
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,479
how do you put it

2
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,060
oh God

3
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,140
thank you nice to meet you

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,340
foreign

5
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,200
foreign

6
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,099
foreign

7
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
foreign

8
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,500
can you hear me yes good morning

9
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,540
everyone welcome to the session on

10
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
symmetric equipped analysis

11
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,600
so um we have four talks the first one

12
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,180
is called algebraic meet in the middle

13
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,960
attack on low NC it's by fukang Liu

14
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,139
Santana

15
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,840
Willie Mayer and takanori izobi and

16
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,440
fukang

17
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,699
so thanks for the introduction so I will

18
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,520
give the talk algebraic meet in the

19
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
middle attack on the MC

20
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,300
so low MSC is a very famous family of

21
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,940
block ciphers proposed at the Euro Crypt

22
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,500
2015. it was designed to be MPC and

23
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,680
the ZK friendly so one notable feature

24
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,740
of low MSC is that its parameters can be

25
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,280
chosen in a flexible way including its

26
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
assigned layers the key schedule

27
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,620
function and the number of Xboxes per

28
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,620
round so low MC is also well known for

29
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,060
its feature of partial non-linear layers

30
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,340
uh

31
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
in this work we focus on the Crypt

32
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,440
analysis of low MC and the previous

33
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,900
results can be classified into four

34
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,020
types we focus on the third type where

35
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,940
two children playing tests the cipher

36
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,620
test pairs can be used and the attacks

37
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,360
in this setting are related to the

38
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,400
security proof of the picnic signature

39
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,520
scheme although it cannot thread the

40
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,919
threat threaten the security of the

41
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,960
picnic signature scheme so uh we improve

42
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,020
the attacks in this setting by proposing

43
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,600
a new technique called algebraic meet in

44
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,180
the middle attack to understand our

45
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,340
attack it's necessary to First

46
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,319
understand the difference in numeration

47
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
attack proposed at a two SEC 2018.

48
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,699
so the general idea is indeed very

49
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,639
simple so giving two children plane test

50
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,979
the cipher test the pairs we can know

51
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,740
its input difference data zero and the

52
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,100
output difference data R then we can

53
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,759
enumerate and store all possible State

54
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,180
differences Delta I computed from data

55
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,780
zero similarly we can also compute all

56
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,500
possible DOTA I starting from Theta R

57
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,139
and for each computed data I we can try

58
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,080
to find a match from the pre computation

59
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,500
table and one such a match is found we

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
get a trail

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
and uh

62
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,440
the key can be simply recovered once

63
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,380
such a chair is fully known because the

64
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,419
active Xbox will leak some information

65
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,259
of the key bits

66
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,099
and in detail let us consider the low

67
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,960
mcsbox so for it for this Xbox so each

68
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,780
input difference data X will correspond

69
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,259
to on average 2 to the 1.86 different

70
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,440
output differences so let us consider

71
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
the low MC parameters with MX boxes per

72
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
round then if you if we want to

73
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,300
enumerate all possible data R starting

74
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,180
from Delta 0 we will obtain due to the

75
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,380
1.86 Mr State differences that are of

76
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,720
course this should be smaller than the

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,240
blocks uh then the block size n

78
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,500
otherwise I mean so otherwise uh it's

79
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,599
impossible to have more than two to the

80
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,360
end State differences because uh it is

81
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
an embed value similarly we can also

82
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
enumerate all possible DOTA 0 starting

83
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,639
from Total R and we will get the same

84
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,780
number of uh State differences

85
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,599
then with this in mind it's easy to

86
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,280
understand the original difference in

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,220
numeration attack so but first by

88
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,780
exploiting the feature of the partial

89
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,240
non-linear layers it's possible to find

90
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,940
us input difference data zero such that

91
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,399
there's no active Xbox in the first are

92
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,339
zero rounds so that are zero is also

93
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,700
fixed then we can apply the above mid in

94
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,580
the middle strategies stated above for

95
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,279
the next R1 plus R2 rounds

96
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,399
and we can get a unique difference

97
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,240
transition from the r0 to Delta R and we

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
can get the unique difference transition

99
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,880
as as differential trail from Delta r0

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,160
to Theta R and this chair will be

101
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,120
exactly the Trail for the uh two

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,740
children plane test the cipher test

103
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,200
pairs

104
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,440
however there are drawbacks so first it

105
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
is only allowed to have one differential

106
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,260
Trail survived after the match so we

107
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,420
only have one Trail survived after the

108
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,600
match and this chair will be exactly uh

109
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,140
the chair uh generated by the tutorial

110
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,880
and plane test the cipher test fails

111
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,940
second the key recovery is too

112
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,580
inefficient of course this is uh there

113
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,920
is no problem for this attack because we

114
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,620
only have one candidate chair and we

115
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,600
only need to perform the key recovery

116
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
from one candidate chair assert the

117
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,360
memory complexity is too high and the

118
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,120
exponential in the middle the number of

119
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,580
middle rounds are one

120
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,940
then at crypto 2021 uh

121
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,040
algebraic method was proposed so

122
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,320
different from the previous attack they

123
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
were not pre-compute a large table of uh

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,160
State difference that are zero plus are

125
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,800
one in other ones instead they will

126
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,740
introduce for example here they will

127
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,040
introduce variables or to represent the

128
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,220
output difference for all the X boxes in

129
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,100
the middle R1 runs then we can know that

130
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,399
that are 0 plus R1 will be linear in

131
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,380
these variables and we should know that

132
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,540
Delta r0 is fixed

133
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,800
so then uh for each challenge that are 0

134
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,860
plus R1 computed backwards we can solve

135
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,620
a linear equation system to recover the

136
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,019
difference transitions in the middle R1

137
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,040
rounds

138
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,839
uh however

139
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,240
the linear equation system cannot be

140
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,760
underdetermined otherwise there will be

141
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,940
too many solutions and we need to check

142
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,579
all the solutions because we need to

143
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,440
enumerate all possible difference

144
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,860
transitions in the middle R1 rounds and

145
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,700
of course we may say that we can uh and

146
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,240
if if this is underdetermined we indeed

147
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,500
it I mean so R1 will be larger but it is

148
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
more expensive to increase

149
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,040
R1 than to increase R2 if

150
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,560
if this is undetermined and the third

151
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,640
the key recovery is still efficient and

152
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,060
because for the inactive Xbox here we

153
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,800
still need to perform the guess and

154
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,640
determine technique

155
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
so so there are still some problems left

156
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
why is how to further reduce the memory

157
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,540
complexity of the original attack and

158
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,880
the second is how to further the middle

159
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,180
R1 runs for the algebraic method and

160
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,579
last we need to further optimize the

161
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,480
time complexity to retrieve clear from a

162
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,760
recovered

163
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,560
candidate differential chair

164
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,360
because now we will have many

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,399
differential candidate chairs after our

166
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,399
wine is increased

167
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
so this is our new attack framework so

168
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,940
it is easy to know where the difference

169
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,860
it is so uh it so in the middle are one

170
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,620
round there will be two phases the first

171
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,440
is the offline phase and the second is

172
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,640
online phase and as the offline phase we

173
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
will do some pre-commutation and then as

174
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,279
the online phase giving any challenge

175
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
that are 0 plus R1 we use uh we we

176
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,600
according to the precon pre-computed

177
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,880
information we retrieve the

178
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,339
corresponding linear equation system and

179
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,680
solve this linear equation system to

180
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,139
recover the difference transitions in

181
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,700
the whole R1 rounds so uh let us in oh

182
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,380
sorry

183
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,760
let us imagine that giving any challenge

184
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,620
completed backwards we can directly

185
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,959
determine some over variables

186
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,380
representing the output differences for

187
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,440
some Xboxes in the in the first R1

188
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,500
rounds and for the variables

189
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,420
representing the output difference of

190
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,899
other Xboxes we can retrieve the

191
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,660
corresponding linear equation system and

192
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,480
solve it so this is Illustrated in this

193
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,100
figure so

194
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,279
in a world so uh different from previous

195
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,399
meet in the middle method we will we

196
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,760
will not store a large table of possible

197
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,860
values of the challenges you know the

198
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,760
ones instead we will store in equations

199
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,399
and each equation will be associated

200
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,300
with an index then give any challenge we

201
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,480
first use it to compute the index and

202
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
then retrieve the corresponding equation

203
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,839
system and then solve it to recover the

204
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,180
four

205
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,639
uh for variables so this is why we call

206
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,440
it algebraic mid in the middle and

207
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,740
and obviously uh the

208
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,600
and obviously

209
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,820
the memory complexity will be reduced

210
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,540
because we do not need to pre-compute uh

211
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,300
the values of these the variables in the

212
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
equation system

213
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,040
so let let me give you more details so

214
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,880
so remember notice our goal is to

215
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,380
recover the state uh the different

216
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,899
translations in the mid R1 rounds giving

217
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,199
this value and we can further split the

218
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,540
middle R1 rounds into the first are one

219
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,760
minus one round and the last one round

220
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,459
and for the last round we further guess

221
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,760
the input differences for ES boxes and

222
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,940
for the first air runs we introduce 3ml

223
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,019
variables to represent

224
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:00,540
to represent the output differences

225
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,060
so we we only consider the case when the

226
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,440
linear equation system is

227
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,959
underdetermined in other words the

228
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,720
number of variables is smaller is larger

229
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,839
or sorry I mean I guess I made a mistake

230
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,480
so the number of variables should be

231
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,579
larger than the number of equations

232
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,820
because if it is not if it is not

233
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,579
undetermined we can directly use the

234
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,720
technique at crypto 2021 and we cannot

235
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,899
uh increase the number of attacked rungs

236
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,279
why may why make when we wonder that

237
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,660
on the determined equation linear

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,699
equation system the term complexity to

239
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,860
enumerate all possible solutions is

240
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,660
lower bounded by its number of solutions

241
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,760
so

242
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,079
intuitively we cannot improve the attack

243
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,339
but we should be aware that uh these

244
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,500
three ml variables are not independent

245
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,260
so we have the chance that there is only

246
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,180
one solution to this underdetermined

247
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,699
linear equation system if we we take

248
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,220
this additional nonlinear relations into

249
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,420
account

250
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
so how to do it first we need to do a

251
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,180
pre-processing so we first can construct

252
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,000
the coefficient Matrix M for f and then

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,760
we know that the linear equation system

254
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,579
is parameterized by n Alpha and Gamma

255
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:23,459
where f is computed from uh Delta r0

256
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,940
and Gamma is the challenge computed

257
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,820
backwards then we can split M into m0

258
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,120
and M1 where m0 represents the first two

259
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,699
columns of M then we apply Gauss

260
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,000
elimination 2 and 1 until it becomes the

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,940
reduce the row at long form and denote

262
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,639
the transformation matrix by q1 by

263
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,220
applying q1 to the original linear

264
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,399
equation system we obtain an equivalent

265
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,920
linear equation system and we also can

266
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,180
know that the last Omega rows of this

267
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,839
Matrix are all zero because we reduce it

268
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,480
to the reduce the row eclone form

269
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,839
and so we will obtain Omega linear

270
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,720
equations only in terms of the first few

271
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,419
variables and uh we

272
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,819
understand and we can these increases

273
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,099
can be parameterized by the coefficient

274
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,799
Matrix P0 Prime Epsilon Prime and the

275
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,599
beta Prime where each snow Prime can be

276
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,299
computed from Alpha and q1 beta Prime

277
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,460
can be computed from The Challenge gamma

278
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,900
and the q1

279
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,260
then as the offline phase we can make Q

280
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,320
equal to 3T in other words we consider

281
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,440
the variables representing the output

282
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,620
difference of the third of the first TX

283
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,940
boxes and then there will be only 2 to

284
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,240
the 1.86 T possible values of its 3T

285
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,640
variables note that

286
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,059
that means so where where so I said

287
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,059
before as I said before these variables

288
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,100
are not independent this indeed shows

289
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
shows this because if these variables

290
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,380
are independent there will be 2 to the

291
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,720
three T possible values but now there

292
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,059
are only two to the 1.850 possible

293
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,520
values so we have the chance that

294
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
there's only one solution to the on the

295
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,900
determinant linear equation system

296
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,140
that's why we can improve the attack

297
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,380
follow MC and so then for all possible

298
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,140
values we can compute beta Prime and

299
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,440
store this typo in a table that uh and

300
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,200
we should know that beta Prime is an

301
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,080
Omega is an Omega bit value and hence in

302
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,900
this table uh each beta Prime will

303
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,039
correspond to 2 to the 1.86 T minus

304
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,039
Omega different values of D1 D2 until

305
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,400
d3t and the memory complexity is due to

306
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,100
the 1.862

307
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,280
that's the online phase then we for each

308
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,559
challenge gamma we can compute the

309
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,200
corresponding beta Prime and then we can

310
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,980
retrieve I mean so compute the index uh

311
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,000
the D1 D2 DC and D3 until d3t from the

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,240
pre-computation table du and then we

313
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,740
solve the first

314
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,460
n minus 3M plus 3 minus Omega rows of

315
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,960
the following linear equation system

316
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,740
because we have considered the last

317
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,380
Omega equations already at the offline

318
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,919
phase and there are only three ml minus

319
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,760
3T variables because the 3D variables

320
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,919
have been pre-computed

321
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,200
and we use it as an index

322
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,260
then uh then pass by some analysis we

323
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,360
can know that giving each challenge

324
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,160
gamma we will have so many uh Solutions

325
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,900
of the variables given D2 until d3ml in

326
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,380
other words for each challenge gamma we

327
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,580
need to verify the verify so many uh

328
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,860
different transitions in the middle R1

329
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,640
rounds so the term complexity of the

330
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
offline phase can be formulated like

331
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
this so

332
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,900
this is the time complexity for the

333
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,780
background difference enumeration and

334
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,960
this is the time complexity for the

335
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,559
backward difference in Meridian plus the

336
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,220
the the the so many

337
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,720
different transitions in the middle R1

338
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,600
runs so we can have some constraints on

339
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,299
these parameters to make our attack

340
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,940
meaningful because we have to be faster

341
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,880
than Brute Force

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,860
so let us consider some concrete

343
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,020
examples so if the there is only one

344
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,900
Xbox per round we can see that the

345
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,539
memory complexity was improved when

346
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,700
compared with different enumeration

347
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,580
attack and so you can see it from here

348
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,080
and

349
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,660
we when there are only 10 Xbox per round

350
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,120
we can also know that the memory

351
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,640
complexity was also improved especially

352
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,460
when the block size is much larger than

353
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,400
the key size we can extend the number of

354
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,120
Maximum R1 because with the previous two

355
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,299
attacks the maximum value of R1 cannot

356
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,380
be uh read the cannot be reached so the

357
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,020
three six eight cannot be reached so we

358
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,140
improve we extend our one by using

359
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,940
additional memory

360
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,900
and uh due to due to our algebraic meet

361
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,240
in the middle method we have more

362
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,340
candidate chairs left

363
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,100
so we need to further optimize the time

364
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,679
complexity to retrieve the key well so

365
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,900
we will use some properties of the low

366
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,299
MCS box one property is that if the

367
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,940
active if the Xbox is active we have two

368
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,400
linear conditions on the input bit and

369
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,520
the Xbox will be freely linearized and

370
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
one property was that we can have 14

371
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,620
linearly independent quadratic equations

372
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,440
to describe the Xbox

373
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,059
so we can uh we can uh

374
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,299
we can after a candidate chair is

375
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,799
recovered we can perform the three key

376
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,720
we can perform the key recovery with

377
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,840
this procedure specifically we can

378
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,120
initialize two counters a and a b a zero

379
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,220
where A and B denotes the number of

380
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,179
active any active Xboxes per round so we

381
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,820
can see it from this figure that so we

382
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,400
start from the cipher test pair if and

383
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,500
then we check the Xbox round by round

384
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,860
and one by one if the Xbox is active we

385
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,860
increase a by one and the Xbox will be

386
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,500
freely linearized and if the Xbox is

387
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,980
inactive we increase B by one and we

388
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,440
introduce three intermediate variables

389
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,539
to represent its input

390
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,799
so and we will have 14 Karthik equations

391
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,120
so we will have so many leading

392
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,280
equations so many equations and so many

393
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,380
variables and we constantly check

394
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,360
whether such equation system can be

395
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,640
solved with the generation technique

396
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,780
and uh to make our attack more efficient

397
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,220
we only considered condition

398
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,320
differential candidate shares and

399
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
success probably probability of our

400
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,780
attack is about 0.5 and the time

401
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,000
complexity is reduced to constant time

402
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,500
when compared with the number of bit

403
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,380
operations of the alarms encryption and

404
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,419
you can see

405
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,520
okay

406
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,799
you can see from this the last column is

407
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,740
this table that we can see significantly

408
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,200
improve uh reduce the security margins

409
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,320
of the low MC parameters especially when

410
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,539
the block size is much larger than the

411
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,720
key size we can break break them and

412
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,820
even break much more rounds

413
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,640
and we can also reduce the security

414
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,960
margins of the vector ciplo MCM and the

415
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,360
security margins are further reduced

416
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,059
in summary we propose new algebraic

417
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,280
attacks on the MC and the attacks are

418
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,140
highly related to the Future functional

419
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,419
linear layers it seems to reveal that

420
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,100
the functional linear layers are still

421
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
not very understood and the key recovery

422
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,419
was also improved by solving our own

423
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,820
defined coding equation system and

424
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,080
finally I want to mention problem

425
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,700
whether we can further improve the

426
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,980
attack for example can we extend R2

427
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,320
because in all the attacks we have the

428
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,140
same constraint so uh that's all thank

429
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,260
you

430
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,440
thank you very much are there questions

431
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,299
on site and online first on sites

432
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,100
one

433
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,140
let's

434
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,159
click online

435
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,679
uh it was a little fast for me part of

436
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,299
it I think I didn't catch something that

437
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,419
you were saying uh a linearization was

438
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,980
your technique for solving the the

439
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,600
quadratic system is that what you're

440
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,299
saying uh is is that something that's

441
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,880
optimal in your framework or could you

442
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,159
use something that requires like a

443
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,260
reduction to normal form or something

444
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,179
might that be an improvement

445
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,860
uh so because the

446
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,440
differential chair is recovered we have

447
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
the capability to recall to construct

448
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,260
such an equation system and almost for

449
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,080
free we only need to check a check the

450
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,860
Xbox is active and active and after the

451
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,620
and we can easily construct such

452
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,260
an increasing system that can be easily

453
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,020
solved so we do not need to do something

454
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,880
like Computing the global basis or

455
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,919
something like that it's very costly we

456
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,320
only need to do the Galaxy elimination

457
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
yeah right thank you

458
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,279
any other questions

459
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,360
okay so let's thank the speaker again

460

the next talk is called Latin dances

461
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,240
reloaded improved cryptanalysis against

462
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,440
salsa and Cha-Cha and the proposal

463
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,419
so it's um

464
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,960
yeah

465
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,980

Fabio Borges and one will give the talk

469
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,480
hello

470
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,480
okay hello

the pilot of this world is a Latin dance

472
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,520
reload Improvement analysis between

473
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,760
Salsa and Chacha and the proposal of

474
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,799
foro

475
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,779
this work is uh worked together with

476
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,740
Murillo coaching

477
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,679
they work in Brazil and I am Juan was

478
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,539
working in the Technology Innovation

479
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,600
Institute in UAE abudan

480
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,779
so first uh it is the agenda for the

481
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:34,260
stock first I'm going to talk about some

482
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,320
brief introduction about salsa and

483
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,779
Chacha and after that which are the best

484
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,179
techniques and gains these two Cypher

485
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,880
screen ciphers and after that I'm going

486
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,299
to talk about our contributions uh

487
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,640
specifically about the quick analysis

488
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,940
that we did against salsa and ChaCha and

489
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,059
after that I'm going to present a cipher

490
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,360
for row it's a new Cipher and finally

491
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,700
our conclusion

492
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,120
so regarding to salsa as we know salsa

493
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,299
is a ciphering painted but by paneer

494
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,840
bursting in 2005 and this Cipher is a

495
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,980
was constructed as alternative to AES

496
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,260
consists of 20 rounds it's fast in

497
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,679
software and it is a spring Cipher a

498
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,539
year a RX Cipher

499
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,520
in

500
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,520
um you can generate 2 to the 64 streams

501
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,940
by using this Cipher so after that in

502
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,860
2008

503
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,980
um the nearby instant modifies salsa in

504
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,460
order to have better diffusion and this

505
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,679
Cipher is being using now in the TLs

506
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,860
version 1.3

507
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,539
these two ciphers are resistance against

508
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,299
a timing

509
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,400
timing attacks and cash attacks to the

510
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,220
inherent properties of these ciphers in

511
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,500
this construction because they are using

512
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,480
irf components

513
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,140
so let's see some state of the r we have

514
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,400
several papers across along the years

515
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,320
critical analyzing salsa and Cha-Cha as

516
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,200
well okay and what's one of the most

517
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,980
remarkable remarkable papers

518
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,620
is this paper from Amazon at all

519
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,260
presented a Passover encryption 2008

520
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,679
because they reached for the first time

521
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,520
um

522
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,279
eight rounds of salsa in the key

523
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,039
recovery setting so this is a very

524
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,500
Dramatical paper because the other

525
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,980
papers the papers more recent papers

526
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,559
only

527
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,640
improve the complexity of this attack

528
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,159
but not they don't go further in the

529
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,299
number

530
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,840
so regarding to salsa sorry to Chacha a

531
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,179
similar we have this paper for Amazon

532
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,960
this paper is a paper that reached seven

533
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,919
rounds of Cha-Cha okay and after that

534
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,179
the following papers only improve the

535
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,380
data complexity or time complexity

536
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,299
okay so because this paper is one of the

537
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,159
most important ones and actually we

538
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,980
already use this paper in our paper I'm

539
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,559
going to talk about about this attack

540
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,539
presented by Amazon this is a

541
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,299
probabilistic ultra big attack so this

542
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,740
probabilistic neutral bit attack

543
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,460
basically is an attack in the to mount

544
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,460
key recovery okay so in the key recovery

545
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,340
usually you have a distinguisher so here

546
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,799
I am representing the distinguisher for

547
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,779
example for for ChaCha with only two

548
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,120
around okay and in the in this

549
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,520
distinguisher uh I am representing the

550
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,260
correlation of this distinguisher but

551
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,220
Epsilon D so after that in the

552
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,500
um he recovery attacks you need to

553
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,779
analyze a few rounds after the

554
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,880
distinguisher so in this case I

555
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,159
analyzing for example in this example we

556
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,820
are analyzing two uh two rounds okay and

557
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,880
there is a claim in the

558
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,279
in the Amazon paper saying that you can

559
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,740
verify the correlation of this

560
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,799
distinguisher by using the inverse of

561
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,380
the K string generation process and also

562
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,600
by using the um

563
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,640
the inverse of the permutation by using

564
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,640
this you can verify this correlation so

565
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,100
so one of the first steps of this attack

566
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,220
is try to identify which key bits it

567
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,000
doesn't have influence or have a very

568
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,460
low probability influence to compute the

569
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,559
correlation of this distinguisher or

570
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,539
these excellently

571
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:46,260
so if you identify these qubits actually

572
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,860
you can of course try to discard this

573
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,799
and in this way you can do for example a

574
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,200
rooted force with better complexity okay

575
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,419
of course there is some

576
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,320
um

577
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,140
there is some

578
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,279
um

579
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,200
formulas to compute the exact

580
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,419
complexities that are in the paper of

581
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,679
almost

582
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,480
so another uh attack that is

583
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,120
very powerful against salsa and Chacha

584
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
is this differential linear attack

585
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,279
against Southern charges are reduced to

586
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,260
seven rounds or eight rounds okay so

587
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,059
this differential linear attack

588
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,940
basically you need to

589
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,299
divide the cipher in two parts okay in

590
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,580
the top part you basically need to find

591
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,159
a differential distinguisher in the

592
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,159
linear part you need to find a linear

593
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,679
distance and after that you need to

594
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,679
connect these two two parts by using uh

595
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,740
for example DCT okay and I am

596
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,260
representing this this part in the

597
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,539
middle that is called the alternate

598
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,120
middle part so I'm representing here the

599
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,039
probability of the differential by P the

600
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,860
correlation of the middle part by R and

601
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,260
the correlation of the linear Power by Q

602
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,120
so the correlation

603
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,299
of this attack will be of the

604
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,940
distinguisher it will be a prq square

605
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,380
and to distinguish a cipher of

606
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,600
um cellular and permutation you need

607
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,779
this number of steps so as you can see

608
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,860
here

609
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,760
um

610
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,360
the factor of the linear

611
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,980
part

612
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,880
um

613
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,360
the factors of the linear part is uh has

614
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,120
the most expensive one because we are

615
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,120
seeing here the spawning four so because

616
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,120
because of this most of the papers uh

617
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,799
technology or cells as well even in our

618
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,120
paper we are

619
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,559
[Music]

620
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,279
um

621
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,980
we study the linear properties of

622
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,720
modularization okay so one of the first

623
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,600
linear properties is one the mostly of

624
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,620
nodes probably is this one involving the

625
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,960
less significant bits of the input and

626
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,760
the less significant bit for now and

627
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,740
this is the expression another property

628
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,159
is involving two consecutive bits of one

629
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,260
of the inputs and one consecutive and

630
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,899
one bit of the other input and one bit

631
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,639
of the output and this is the expression

632
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,739
and this happens probability three over

633
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,659
four so

634
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,639
now I'm going to talk about our

635
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,280
contribution so by looking at these two

636
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,219
linear properties that I just mentioned

637
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,520
and uh looking also in the formulas of

638
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,500
the quarter round of capture we managed

639
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,260
to improve the number of lemmas the

640
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,599
number of rules uh presented by previous

641
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,119
paper as for example chaudhuri and Mitra

642
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,379
and coutinho a Euro Creek 2020 and 2021

643
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,540
okay so by using only three rules we

644
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,599
managed to generate all the previous

645
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,060
rules to find a linear approximation

646
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,520
with high correlation

647
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,400
okay so by using this uh

648
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
this linear approximation with these

649
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,839
only three rules we managed to construct

650
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,520
an attack against seven rounds of

651
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,780
Cha-Cha

652
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,280
in the following way we first use a

653
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,480
communicated differential proposed by

654
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,180
coutinho and souls and that's a paper

655
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,700
presented in 2020 that is in the spring

656
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,400
and this to create a differential has a

657
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,780
probability to the minus 11 okay and for

658
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,320
the linear power we use our tool that

659
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,140
we're implementing in this tool

660
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,240
um these three rules that I just

661
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,180
mentioned and by using this tool we

662
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,020
managed to find this

663
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,140
this correlation 2 to the minus 53 so

664
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,980
the complexity then will be

665
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,839
2.214. this is an improvement of two to

666
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,119
that thing

667
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,800
compared with the previous best no

668
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,700
attack

669
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,119
okay regarding to salsa to critical

670
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,800
salsa we

671
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,339
um

672
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,200
we developed a technique called

673
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,260
bi-directional linear expansion

674
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,260
in this technique we basically observe

675
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,980
which are uh which are the diffusion

676
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,579
properties of salsa and charging as you

677
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,579
can see the diffusion properties of uh

678
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,339
of salsa charger if you look for example

679
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,560
for differential or line approximation

680
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,980
with a high probability High correlation

681
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,680
you will see that in general for a few

682
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,579
rounds those those differential or

683
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,320
linear approximation with only a few

684
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,540
active bits in the input or in the

685
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,140
output uh have a the better correlation

686
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,660
the higher correlation so looking

687
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,440
observing this we start our uh attack

688
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,099
against salsa reduced to eight rounds by

689
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,260
only one activate activating only one

690
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,140
bit at round five and after that we go

691
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,960
backward and forward to go backward we

692
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,320
use the quarter round formulas okay and

693
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,859
we go we obtain distributes at round

694
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:08,700
four

695
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,760
and for the differential part we use a

696
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
Amazon at all

697
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,720
um located differential that happens

698
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,180
with probability to the minus one and to

699
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,820
go from the output of this

700
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,320
uh one round truncated differential

701
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,079
to the round four we use some experiment

702
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,540
using Cuda and out that are also

703
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,880
implemented in our tool called Crypt

704
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,940
answers that later I will show the link

705
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,859
okay

706
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,680
so to go from round one to round four we

707
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,280
did this experiment and we compute this

708
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,380
uh we obtain this correlation so by

709
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,540
using the peeling a lemon you can

710
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,940
compute the correlation of the input

711
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,079
linear Mass

712
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,440
you can see here that if you try to do

713
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,119
the or to compute the correlation

714
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
directly from round one to round four

715
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,400
where without using the peeling up Lemma

716
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,780
you will need more than 280

717
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,880
samples so this is a youth number and

718
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,220
it's this is why we

719
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,760
um

720
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,599
we compute the correlation

721
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,579
to each bit and after that we use the

722
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,240
building for the linear part we

723
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,900
we use also three plans our tool and we

724
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,460
found this

725
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,839
this correlation total minus 54. so by

726
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,820
using now

727
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,099
this the distinguisher we can compute

728
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,020
the complexity that is two to the uh 215

729
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,579
okay and this is the first time ever

730
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,440
that someone present

731
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,480
um uh according as far as we know uh

732
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,040
an attack against salsa reduced to eight

733
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,380
rounds but only using uh pure

734
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,880
differential differential linear

735
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,560
distinguish a pure distinguish not in

736
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,640
the curriculum

737
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,800
so for the key recovery

738
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,900
we

739
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,339
we use this five previous five round

740
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,680
differential linear distinguisher and we

741
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,320
use the probabilistice neutral bits to

742
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,359
mount accurate recovery against salsa

743
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,099
reduced to eight rounds

744
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,480
okay and this data complexity is 2 to

745
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,300
the

746
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,740
113.14 and the time complexities to the

747
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,200
217.62

748
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,619
and these represents an improvement of 2

749
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,660
to the 32 uh

750
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,200
due to the 32 compared with the previous

751
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,460
best attack in the care recovery

752
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,760
settings against cells so now I'm going

753
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,020
to talk about foreign

754
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,720
basically observe the number of

755
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,240
components of salsa and Chacha as you

756
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,800
can see the number of components

757
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,320
including all the components the

758
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,260
rotation modularization axle operations

759
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,960
are 12. so by using this uh and by using

760
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,540
advice of a paneer Basin that is

761
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,300
presented in his paper in 2008 that he

762
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,060
said replacing some of the rotation with

763
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,980
a comparable number of additions might

764
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,839
achieve a comparable diffusion in less

765
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,960
than by using these two facts and

766
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,680
craft a graphic design working up with

767
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,300
this cycle called Forum so this is

768
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,060
better diffusion than structure okay so

769
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,820
we recommend to use a 14 rounds because

770
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,079
of this and decipher as Cha-Cha salsa

771
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,859
also we have a version with this 256 uh

772
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,359
qubits

773
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,380
and now I'm going to explain how is the

774
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,760
design for only two rounds uh for row so

775
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,260
as Chacha or salsa we can represent the

776
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,900
is the state of the

777
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,180
of the of this Cipher

778
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,079
by using a matrix 4x4 where each cell of

779
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,500
the Matrix is a n bit

780
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,440
unsigned has been a number okay and now

781
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
here I'm going to put only two rounds so

782
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,500
I'm going to display how it works for

783
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,680
the

784
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,680
round to the column but we need to

785
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,280
choose another word okay which which

786
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,920
word we are we are using we are using

787
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,500
the word with better diffusion

788
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,540
of the private court and round to

789
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,200
compute the actors why because in the

790
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,359
previous quarter round this word that we

791
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,220
are using we are picking to the next

792
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,400
person round is that one with the that

793
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,640
one that to reach this word we need to

794
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,320
pass across all the components of the

795
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,119
quarter round so this is why we are

796
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,920
using this

797
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,640
um this word okay and we keep doing this

798
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,740
for all

799
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,220
The Columns in this

800
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,579
in this even round for the old round

801
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,000
the same we need to pass always the

802
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,640
previous quarter round with with the

803
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,359
better diffusion and uh we keep doing

804
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,440
this

805
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,339
up to the end of the

806
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,220
up to the end of the of the round but as

807
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,880
in Chacha we are doing this by diagonal

808
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,480
okay

809
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,619
so regarding the

810
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,560
regarding the security and performance

811
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,079
we reached up to five uh 5.25 rounds

812
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,660
against row okay by using the state of

813
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,460
the art so we use also differential

814
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,720
linear

815
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,260
attacks to analyze the security overall

816
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,940
and

817
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,500
regarding the attacks in the care

818
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,839
recovery setting we also combine

819
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,760
differential linear attacks with

820
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,800
probability neutral base attacks angry

821
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,000
five rounds of raw with

822
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,680
this quantity of round and we

823
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,440
implemented for raw in several Hardware

824
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,880
architectures

825
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,900
okay and we see that for for example arm

826
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,640
architectures

827
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,079
is slightly has a slightly better

828
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,180
diffusion than

829
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,500
salsa and Chacha okay but that doesn't

830
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,900
happen in the Intel architecture why

831
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,540
because uh in the internet architecture

832
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,140
we have this technique called

833
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,140
speculative technique where the

834
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,099
where the Intel basically

835
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:54,599
um manage or predict which instructions

836
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,960
will uh

837
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,460
in parallel and this is something

838
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,220
inherent to the rounds of Chacha and

839
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,440
salsa because in salsa and Chacha you

840
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,460
can apply

841
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,780
the quarter rounds in parallel way so in

842
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,780
for row we sequentialize the round so

843
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,640
this is why for this uh architecture

844
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,740
um

845
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,380
slightly words and culture answers

846
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,640
okay

847
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,200
um

848
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,960
okay now finally the conclusions

849
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,140
okay we present a new technique to

850
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,859
attack

851
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,220
um salsa

852
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,200
we reach eight rounds by using this

853
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,660
differential linear distinguisher okay

854
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,140
and we present also I present um

855
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,079
a round uh

856
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,060
an attack against

857
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,380
Tulsa reduced to eight rounds and we

858
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,140
managed to improve the previous World by

859
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,060
a factor 2 to the 32.

860
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,400
like we are using uh in the case of

861
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,560
Chacha we are using or trying to improve

862
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,319
the number of Lemma of previous words

863
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,920
okay and our attack is due to the uh

864
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,160
time faster than the previous uh no

865
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,720
attack

866
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,500
um

867
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,920
and always reduce to seven rounds okay

868
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,420
here in charge

869
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,880
we are looking forward to apply our

870
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,760
techniques also to Chaska for example

871
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,380
that is also a or excise

872
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,220
that has better diffusion than Chacha

873
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,540
and here is the link of our tool called

874
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,980
keep dances that is well thank you

875
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,980
foreign

876
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,880
thank you very much

877
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,680
um are there any questions on site

878
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,180
and

879
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,339
online well there is one

880
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,619
okay so so then I have a question so you

881
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,660
say you're looking forward to apply your

882
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,599
techniques to other ciphers you have any

883
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,560
specifics in mind

884
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,300
all right

885
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,540
yes for example we are thinking to apply

886
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,160
to chaski

887
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,260
this is a one of the proximal next work

888
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,099
okay any other questions

889
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,579
yes

890
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,480
okay thanks for your presentation so so

891
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,579
in your work it seems to use a new

892
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,839
approximation for the modular Edition

893
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,259
right

894
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,800
um well yeah so maybe there are some

895
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,780
underlying assumptions like independency

896
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,660
because you approximate for many rounds

897
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,540
I will verify them experimentally okay

898
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,819
nice uh thank you for the question

899
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:15,060
uh we have in this in one of the slide

900
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,040
is this transition from round one to

901
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,839
round four I think you are asking

902
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,099
because of this uh yes we need we did

903
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,960
some uh assumptions regarding the

904
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,619
Independence Independence yeah

905
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,700
but actually

906
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,619
because the number of samples that we

907
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,740
need to verify this a transition is so

908
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,040
high we needed to split our experiments

909
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,920
to the to the round one to round four

910
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,240
Bit by Bit by Bit but uh to verify that

911
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,940
really works we

912
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,980
we did some a few experiments also by uh

913
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,640
in a small number of rounds so using

914
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,180
this we managed to to find this

915
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,760
correlation so you mean for a small

916
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,579
number of rounds uh it matches your

917
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,020
theoretical analysis yes okay so okay

918
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,980
that's all thank you

919
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:18,180
okay any other questions

920
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,799
okay let's thank the speaker again

921
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,259
the next talk will be given online

922
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,839
things

923
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,280
is related

924
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,300
okay

925
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,240
okay so the the next talk is called mind

926
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,700
the Tweaky schedule cryptanalysis on

927
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,920
skinny

928
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,119
e64-56 it's a paper by lingui Quinn Yang

929
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,319
dong on

930
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:22,740
sorry for the pronunciation I apologize

931
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,980
and um

932
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,060
will give the talk online

933
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,800
if that works yes

934
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,660
so please go ahead

935
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,520
okay hello my name is today I will talk

936
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,220
about our paper and the techie schedule

937
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:53,040
crap the analysis on skinny eat 64256

938
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,960
this talk includes the following four

939
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,319
parts first we briefly introduce the

940
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:05,060
background and our contributions

941
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,920
at Asia crept 2014 Jane or proposed the

942
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,140
turkey framework for technical block

943
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,200
ciphers they considered the take and the

944
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,660
key Imports in a unified manner as a

945
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,780
check key a subclass of tech key for as

946
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,599
like ciphers named as the SDK

947
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,359
construction is shown in the finger many

948
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,819
designs of technical block ciphers are

949
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:33,960
proposed such as Deoxys skinny and craft

950
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,560
foreign

951
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,200
following the techie framework and the

952
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,880
SDK Construction

953
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,400
there are six languages due to different

954
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,460
block sections and tacky size they end

955
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,020
in each round

956
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,599
the state is updated with style

957
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,839
operations sub-sales and constants at

958
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,180
around taking shift rows and mixed

959
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,440
columns

960
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,740
are important difference between the SDK

961
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,140
and skinny is that in the turkey

962
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,900
schedule the sales of the turkey are

963
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,040
updated by lfsr is that of multiplying

964
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,500
and coefficient Alpha in the finite

965
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,819
field then at eurocraft 2020 the

966
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:20,579
threshold Implement implementation

967
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,240
friendly Cipher skin e

968
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,180
64256 extends the design of skinny to

969
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,220
support the

970
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,040
256 big turkey to meet the requirements

971
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,339
for the ti friendly amount it applies

972
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,319
the same run function but a new turkey

973
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:40,859
schedule however the security claim may

974
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,099
not hold due to the new turkey schedule

975
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,319
in response the author's purpose the

976
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,880
updated version 2.

977
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,059
in this paper we give a formal analysis

978
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:57,240
of relations of sub turkeys to clarify

979
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,280
the properties of the new techie

980
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,260
schedule especially the difference

981
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,180
cancellation property in the

982
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,579
differential like distinguishers and the

983
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,619
relations of subtechnics

984
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,140
by exploring the properties in the

985
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,819
rectangle attack meeting is a middle

986
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,099
attack and the impossible differential

987
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,579
attack we discovered and extended

988
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:19,680
distinguishers okay recovery attacks

989
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,500
further repurpose a uniformed design

990
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,440
strategy for turkey schedule of an easy

991
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,440
equal to or less than 14. our schedules

992
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,260
satisfy the security requirements with a

993
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,200
formal proof

994
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,480
second the properties we found for the

995
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,660
new turkey schedule

996
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,960
in the turkey schedule of skin e64256

997
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,380
so 2

998
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,780
156-speed turkey is built as four four

999
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,720
times four square areas of nipples as

1000
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,760
tk1 to TK4

1001
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,520
in each round a permutation Peak is

1002
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,680
applied to each ebook of all turkey

1003
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,640
areas then apply the iofsr to update

1004
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,579
each nipple of the first and second rows

1005
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:08,160
of tk2 to TK4

1006
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,760
the difference between the skinny e64256

1007
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,559
and acceleration 2 is the lfsr used for

1008
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,680
the TK4 since the turkey schedule is

1009
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,500
linear we can drive the subjects from

1010
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,140
the same nipple of the master key as a

1011
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,099
system of linear equations where Li is a

1012
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,099
four times four binary Matrix

1013
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:34,200
corresponding to each lfsr

1014
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,980
we can use a with index R1 to RT to

1015
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,760
represent the coefficient Matrix

1016
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,819
the rank of the coefficient Matrix a is

1017
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:48,359
almost constant when the wrong is a the

1018
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,760
image space represents the solution

1019
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,880
space of those subjects which is 2 2A

1020
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,119
and the kernel space is related to the

1021
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,700
difference cancellations where the

1022
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,700
subtracting differences are set to zero

1023
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,960
for example 4 4 consecutive subjects in

1024
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
round 0 2 4 6 from the sixth same as

1025
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,559
nipple the drug of the coefficient

1026
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,400
Matrix is 14. so I'll fix the master key

1027
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,099
there are 2 to 14 possible solutions of

1028
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,800
the four sub turkeys if we set the

1029
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,000
supply differences to zero zero will be

1030
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,760
only three non-zero Solutions of the

1031
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,280
master key difference which led the

1032
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,200
difference calculations happen in the

1033
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,960
four top turkeys

1034
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,599
we want to analyze the relations of the

1035
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,540
rank for different matrices we've done

1036
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,599
that for some matrices a corresponding

1037
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,220
to each different

1038
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,880
uh in taxes they have the same rank so

1039
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,800
we introduce the wrong equivalent

1040
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,280
property where two subsets satisfy some

1041
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,740
equal difference relations we call them

1042
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,040
a wrong equivalent

1043
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,200
then we Define the wrong equivalence

1044
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,160
class

1045
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,460
for any wrong equivalent subsets X and Y

1046
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,880
the drug of ax is equal to the drug of a

1047
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,240
y we find when T is greater than or

1048
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,240
equal to 4. certain sets of index will

1049
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,940
lead to non-forward coefficient Matrix

1050
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,400
then we count all different rank

1051
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,520
equivalence classes of network not for

1052
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,220
rock and list Parts in the table

1053
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:33,300
first in E 64256 version 2. the

1054
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,760
coefficient Matrix is always for long

1055
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:40,740
four original skinny Family Wednesday is

1056
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,599
equal to 203 for given active technical

1057
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:47,220
subtracting difference cancellations can

1058
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,160
happen Z minus 1 times in every 30

1059
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,400
rounds for skin

1060
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,160
e64256 the number for Long properties

1061
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,140
can lead to more sub-techy difference

1062
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,780
cancellations than expected

1063
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,079
once the Matrix is foreground the size

1064
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,780
of its kernel space is one then the

1065
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,240
master key difference has only one zero

1066
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,540
solution which is not active The Matrix

1067
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,819
is nothing wrong the master key

1068
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,400
difference has Zero Solutions which

1069
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,960
means the subtracting difference

1070
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,079
cancellations can happen

1071
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,540
also using all the number wrong

1072
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,640
equivalence classes in the upper table

1073
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,859
we summarize several different

1074
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,839
cancellation behaviors

1075
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,260
when T is 4 all the matrices are not

1076
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,079
known for wrong that is for the given

1077
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,420
active nipple in the master key the

1078
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,339
difference calculations can happen four

1079
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:43,859
times in arbitrary rounds for every 30

1080
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,800
rounds when T is greater than or equal

1081
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,540
to fail

1082
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,960
O Rank is 15. there is only one that

1083
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
zero solution of the master K difference

1084
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,000
for some different wrong equivalence

1085
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,480
classes the solutions are same for

1086
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,599
example the solutions of the two listed

1087
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,960
equations are same that is for the same

1088
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,940
MasterCard difference the constellations

1089
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,920
will happen at the positions

1090
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,500
corresponding to the two index sets at

1091
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,579
the same time

1092
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:17,400
at last there are totally two kinds of

1093
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,980
different cancellation behaviors where

1094
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,020
the subject key difference cancellation

1095
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,040
happens 708 times in the fixed rounds of

1096
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,680
every 30 rounds

1097
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,859
in K recovery attacks several runs are

1098
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:34,260
added before and after the distinguisher

1099
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,780
under the new world subjects should be

1100
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,180
guessed to recover the master key

1101
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,640
following similar idea of the Key Bridge

1102
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,400
Technique we can use the relations of

1103
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,160
sub-techies to get more accurate and

1104
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,680
efficient guessing strategy in the key

1105
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,180
recovery phase

1106
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,480
for example assume that a sum of top

1107
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,940
techies derived from the same nipple are

1108
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,460
to be guessed the number of possible

1109
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,339
guidance is determined by the rank

1110
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:05,160
for example the number of possible

1111
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,640
values for the first RP subtract case is

1112
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,579
2 to 8 then after guessing the RT

1113
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,640
subject is the number of possible gases

1114
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
gases for the last nipple is 2 to B

1115
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,819
minus a

1116
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:23,099
then applying those properties we

1117
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,240
analyze the security of skinny skinny

1118
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,880
e64256 and inspiration 2.

1119
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,339
the borrowing attack uses two short

1120
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:34,500
differentials to construct a longer

1121
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,200
distinguisher then the bombering attack

1122
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,660
is developed into the rectangle attack

1123
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,540
which require only chosen plant test

1124
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,720
queries it's a powerful craft analytic

1125
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,480
technique for skin family in related key

1126
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,380
setting

1127
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,420
there are several key recovery

1128
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,240
Frameworks of rectangle attack

1129
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,780
inside don't eat all purpose or new

1130
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,240
related key rectangle attack servers

1131
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,920
with linear key schedule

1132
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,200
they try to guess all subject Keys

1133
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,619
involved in EP and part eef so with

1134
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,960
special decryption they make a more

1135
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,059
inactive bits from the internal States

1136
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:13,680
and filters

1137
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,680
to reduce the time complexity in

1138
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,700
security career phase

1139
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,760
attack framework taking the automatic

1140
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,200
model by adding the difference

1141
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,900
cancellation behaviors and searching the

1142
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,460
whole rectangle attack

1143
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,240
so automatic models are divided into two

1144
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,700
cases according to different different

1145
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,700
cancellation behaviors and searches for

1146
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,500
shortfall distinguish

1147
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,980
when T is less than or equal to four the

1148
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,319
number of cancellations is restricted

1149
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,740
when T is greater than or equal to 5 the

1150
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,540
possible on the positions of

1151
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,960
constellations are fixed to two cases

1152
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,660
is a 30 round distinguisher we found

1153
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,480
there are eight constellations in every

1154
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,359
certain

1155
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:05,520
so adding four rounds before and the

1156
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,339
seven runs after the distinguation we

1157
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,260
can attack the 14 white round skin

1158
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,359
e64256

1159
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,119
the time complexity is okay recovery

1160
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,400
phase can be further reduced by the K

1161
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,920
relations involved in EP and EF

1162
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,140
we also apply the number wrong property

1163
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,980
of coefficient Matrix to improve the npm

1164
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,799
attacks in single turkey setting and the

1165

geological key impossible differentials

1166
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,760
recently several automatic models on

1167
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,359
mitm attacks are presented at crypto

1168

1169
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,180
for MIT MK recovery attack on skin

1170
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,619
combining their model and all new

1171
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,920
discoveries on the turkey schedule we

1172
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,000
developed an mitmk recovery attack on 31

01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,940
The Impossible differential attack uses

1175
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,819
a differential with probability zero to

1176
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:12,599
act as a distinguisher research out a 21

1177
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,119
round related tacky impossible

1178
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,799
differences on skin e64256

1179
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,280
we summarize the crypto analytic results

1180
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,240
on skin E64 and compare results

1181
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,980
our Capital analysis proves that skin

1182
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,200
e64256 doesn't keep a similar security

1183
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,980
margin as expected by the dependence for

1184
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,859
example our attack leaves only a three

1185
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:44,880
round security machine for skin e64256

1186
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,520
where there are 11 rounds for skinny

1187
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,700
sticks for one to eight and nylons for

1188
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,000
skinny 64192

1189
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,180
in addition we also analyze the updated

1190
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,420
elevation too the targeted round keeps

1191
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,819
the same rate as expected by the

1192
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,420
designers

1193
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,299
at last we give our proposal for techy

1194
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:11,880
schedule of skinny family

1195
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,940
the STK construction supports editorials

1196
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,940
of turkey but the skinny family and skin

1197
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,380
is supposed up to four unbeat turkey

1198
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,119
skinny with larger turkey size may be

1199
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,660
useful in future applications we propose

1200
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,059
a uniformed design strategy for turkey

1201
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:33,299
schedule of skin and thin for positive

1202
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:36,839
interest rate less than or equal to 14.

1203
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:39,240
to satisfy the subtracted difference

1204
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,819
consolation property for given sale

1205
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,700
position Z minus one constellations can

1206
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,480
only happen every 15 rounds 40kg or

1207
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,180
every 30 rounds for skin and

1208
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,000
the coefficient Matrix should satisfy

1209
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,339
the block and DS property

1210
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,740
where the determinant of the coefficient

1211
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,220
Matrix is not zero

1212
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,160
our construction is an extension of the

1213
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,119
generic Matrix of the RS code reset L1

1214
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,359
to the identity Matrix and choose the AI

1215
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:15,000
to be the consecutive purpose of a

1216
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,839
matrix scale once L satisfied specific

1217
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:22,200
property we can give a proposition to

1218
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,920
guarantee the block and DS property

1219
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,339
one simple way is taking L to be the

1220
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:33,119
company Matrix of operative polynomial

1221
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,380
in our example we find that the lfsr for

1222
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,440
tk2 and tk3 coincide with the original

1223
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,299
OS XR is Guinea and the lfsr 40k4

1224
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:47,760
coincides with that constructed in

1225
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,799
skinny

1226
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,380
64256 region 2.

1227
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,359
from this point of view all construction

1228
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:57,599
can be built as a natural distinction of

1229
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,400
the original skinny

1230
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,280
six foot and the second is six four two

1231
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,220
five six version two

1232
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,859
how to choose AI to optimize the

1233
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:10,020
implementation efficiency is an

1234
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,520
important issue

1235
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,000
One Direction of optimization is to

1236
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,839
minimize the total number of xors

1237
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,640
required by the lfsr

1238
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,640
we enumerate all possible L and Alpha

1239
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,140
and lists of optimal number of xors

1240
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,540
required in the table

1241
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,359
from 4 to 7.

1242
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:36,119
another direction of optimization is to

1243
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:39,900
minimize the circuit area of the lfsr in

1244
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,940
our construction the minimal

1245
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:45,240
implementation is only 1l and Computing

1246
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,540
others iteratively where the area is one

1247
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:52,380
and the latency is 6. but also propose

1248
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,319
an area that Institute of to reduce the

1249
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,160
latency by slightly increasing the area

1250
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,440
all construction can be naturally you

1251
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,619
can lead to choose 3 times C Matrix such

1252
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:07,380
that the block MDS property is also

1253
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,579
satisfied

1254
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,559
uh just everything I want to talk about

1255
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,760
thanks for your attention

1256
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:22,079
thank you very much

1257
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,359
are there any questions on site first

1258
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,880
online Maybe

1259
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,880
okay then I have a question so you

1260
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,000
propose a new Tweaky schedule

1261
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,799
um can you

1262
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,380
can you give us some some feedback of

1263
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,619
the performance impact it can it can

1264
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:48,780
have on the on the

1265
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,520
on the on the cipher itself

1266
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:58,500
you mean the process of proposition

1267
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,480
yeah your proposition what would be the

1268
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,020
performance impact you you would expect

1269
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:06,180
well the basic idea is we gave some

1270
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,000
direct compilation method of the

1271
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,700
determinant of the block uh one month

1272
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,819
Matrix uh then using the property of the

1273
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:18,359
Aging values which are not zero or what

1274
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:23,299
we can come accomplish the proof

1275
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,940
okay but will this slow down

1276
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,440
um skinny or

1277
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,760
uh skin uh storage pattern

1278
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,240
so so what would be the do you can you

1279
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,859
evaluate the the impact on the

1280
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,380
performance of the block Cipher

1281
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,599
oh performance okay

1282
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,200
okay

1283
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,500
did you try implementing one of them and

1284
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,200
see what what would be the performance

1285
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,400
impact

1286
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,480
oh no no wait I definitely gave the

1287
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,760
experiment okay

1288
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,720
any other questions

1289
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,039
thank the speaker again

1290
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,140
so the next talk will be online again

1291
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,119
it's called enhancing differential

1292
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,339
neural cryptanalysis

1293
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:30,660
it's by Jen Jen Bao Juan go matching Liu

1294
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,980
Lima and yitu and zhenjin will give the

1295
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,720
talk

1296
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,160
you can share your screen

1297
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,420
are you online

1298
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,359
okay

1299
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,240
okay thank you we can see your slides

1300
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,740
you

1301
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,260
your flow is yours

1302
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,660
uh hello everyone

1303
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:13,020
uh can you hear me sorry

1304
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,040
yeah yeah yes we can hear you okay sorry

1305
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,679
this work is enhancing differential

1306
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,259
neural Crypt analysis students work with

1307
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:26,698
tianco Lima and E2 I'm Ginger

1308
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:28,560
the differential neurological analysis

1309
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,198
was proposed by God in the seminal work

1310
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,560
in crypto 2019 in the improved key

1311
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,540
recovery framework a classical

1312
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:39,660
differential is combined with a neural

1313
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,899
distinguisher besides a highly selective

1314
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:46,080
key guessing strategy was used in the

1315
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,479
framework the neurodextinguisher is

1316
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,359
built by training neural networks to

1317
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,040
distinguish two types of server

1318
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,920
taxpayers pairs whose corresponding

1319
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,299
plant hacks have a specific

1320
01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:02,698
difference and the Players whose plan

1321
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:05,160
exists are randomly selected

1322
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,040
says the neural distinguisher were

1323
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,080
trained with the principle of

1324
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,899
differential cryptolysis Inland but

1325
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,899
different from classical different

1326
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:17,640
differential whose output difference is

1327
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,759
specified the neurodistinguisher accepts

1328
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,040
several taxpayers

1329
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,620
the target Cipher is the smallest

1330
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,839
version of the lightweight block Cipher

1331
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,939
spec with s32-bit block and

1332
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:36,120
64-bit key which is an arc Cipher that

1333
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,279
is it used modular addition for

1334
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,000
nonlinearity use rotations and xor for

1335
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,060
diffusion each training data is a

1336
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,060
Stafford taxpayer transformed into a

1337
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,819
quadruple of words among the training

1338
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,238
data have a positive and have a negative

1339
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,040
given the labels 1 and 0 respectively

1340
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,080
the neural network structure is the

1341
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,219
commonly used deep residual Network

1342
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:07,199
sorry

1343
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,840
and three training schemes were used to

1344
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,239
obtain up to eight ranked

1345
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,980
neurodistinguishers

1346
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,280
a change neural

1347
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,420
neurodistinguisher will give a score

1348
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,659
between 0 and 1 so each unlabeled server

1349
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:24,360
text pair which is equivalent to a

1350
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,380
probability indicating How likely it

1351
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,260
predict the given data is positive when

1352
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,739
it is larger than 0.5 we say it's pretty

1353
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:38,699
positive otherwise is pretty negative

1354
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:41,400
according to the real labels the

1355
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,800
accuracy of the distinguisher can be

1356
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,060
evaluated

1357
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,699
this neural distinguishers are shown to

1358
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:50,159
have the pure accuracy than the full

1359
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,020
differential distribution based

1360
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,380
distinguishers and they use the features

1361
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,719
not represented in the different

1362
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:00,000
distribution table

1363
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,640
so using this and this under the

1364
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,159
improved key recovery framework with

1365
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:08,040
comparable data complexity the time

1366
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,800
complexity of the attack are 11 rounds

1367
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,420
of spec 3264 was reduced considerably

1368
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,659
so this goes into the next questions to

1369
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:21,360
what extent is the advantage of

1370
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,400
differential neural Crypt analysis over

1371
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,280
traditional methods and better the

1372
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,560
advantage generally exists in the

1373
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,500
cryptoysis of modern ciphers

1374
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,199
to answer the first question with Device

1375
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,420
differential neural attacks on more

1376
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,980
rounds of spec 3264 we found that the

1377
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,260
previous differential neural attack is

1378
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,040
not optimal by enhancing it the 12 round

1379
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,420
attack can be improved and moreover a

1380
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,940
practical kiwi career attack on certain

1381
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,980
rounds can be achieved

1382
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,679
accordingly differential neural analysis

1383
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:01,440
has more potential than its initially

1384
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,120
exhibited

1385
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,880
however the master developed to enhance

1386
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,540
the attack RIS classical component that

1387
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,580
is

1388
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,400
deeply exploring the neutral bits

1389
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,040
the motivation is to boost the big

1390
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,040
signal from the distinguishers when we

1391
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,199
look closer at the distinguisher's

1392
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,719
response we can see that the

1393
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,120
distribution of responses on positive

1394
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,760
and negative samples are largely

1395
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,480
separated for five and six rounds but

1396
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,000
with the increasing number of runs the

1397
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,719
two distributions are hardly separated

1398
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,960
fortunately when combining scores of

1399
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,020
multiple samples of same attributes that

1400
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,780
is multiple positive or multiple

1401
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,080
negative samples and to get a new score

1402
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,260
using a formula like this the accuracy

1403
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,020
can increase effectively

1404
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,020
for example for seven months combining

1405
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,140
two to the 1 2 to the 4 2 to the sixth

1406
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,719
scores from the and the same attribute

1407
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,260
samples the distribution of the compound

1408
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,620
response are gradually concentrated so

1409
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,719
the distribution of positive and

1410
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:17,760
negative samples can be largely

1411
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,080
separated

1412
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,480
as for the weak eighth round in your

1413
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,659
distinguisher it's required about 2 to

1414
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,060
the 12 scores on the same attribute

1415
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,280
samples for the distribution to be

1416
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,719
separated

1417
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,420
however Gathering samples of same

1418
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,880
attribute is not trivial in the

1419
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,560
differential neural key recovery

1420
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,320
framework that is because of the

1421
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,900
prepended classical differential which

1422
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,400
is probability

1423
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,280
that is how the concept of neutral bits

1424
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,820
is inverted by God to this framework

1425
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,420
the neutral bit is first introduced by

1426
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:56,820
bihamaja for attacking shot zero it has

1427
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,300
many extensions and related Concepts

1428
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,179
including message modification terminals

1429
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:06,239
boomerangs probability neutral bits and

1430
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,360
tributes so I'm happy to conforming

1431
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,060
pairs of a differential sleeping and

1432
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,000
neutral bits of both of the plant hacks

1433
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,300
the resulting pair will also conform to

1434
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,560
the differential

1435
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,500
oh this is hold with a high probability

1436
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,500
for which case we say it is the

1437
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,500
probability neutral bits the speed

1438
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,620
neutral bits one can get a structure of

1439
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,739
2 to the B data pairs conforming do not

1440
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:37,860
conform to the CD together

1441
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,380
the more neutral bits of the prepended

1442
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,260
city the most the same attribute samples

1443
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:46,679
could be generated and combined to boost

1444
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,100
the weak signal from the distinguisher

1445
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,199
however generates the longer the city

1446
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:55,020
the fewer the neutral bits

1447
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,659
These Bars shows the neutral probability

1448
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,360
of each beat for a very round

1449
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,719
differential where this Stars marks the

1450
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:06,179
position of active bits of the input

1451
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:08,340
output difference of the modular

1452
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,860
addition

1453
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,600
these are for the two rung differential

1454
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,020
trail that is used in girls in 11 rounds

1455
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,940
kiwi career attack

1456
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,940
this is the situation if we extending

1457
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,440
one round

1458
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,320
one more round one can see that there is

1459
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,620
no high probability neutral bits anymore

1460
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,600
the number of neutributes naturally

1461
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,900
depends on the number of rungs but also

1462
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,360
depends on the distribution of active

1463
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,760
bits of the differences in the dominant

1464
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,760
dominant differential Trail

1465
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,320
for example

1466
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:47,100
this is the situation for one round

1467
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,280
two rounds and three rounds of another

1468
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,460
differential Trail it is sub-optimal but

1469
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,940
uh have more problem neutral neutral

1470
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,600
beats so this Trail is used in Aura text

1471
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,820
still these nutributes are not

1472
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,699
sufficient so two types of generalized

1473
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,980
neutral beads are considered young that

1474
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,679
considered in ghost work

1475
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:13,020
the first half is the simultaneous

1476
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,880
neutral B size

1477
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,620
as a

1478
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,340
so

1479
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,920
um

1480
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,040
that is a well for differential given a

1481
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,739
confirming pair sleeping individual bits

1482
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:31,679
the conformability might be changed but

1483
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,980
simultaneously flipping a set of it does

1484
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,679
now change the conformability of the

1485
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,140
resulting pair so take the above

1486
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,199
differential chill as an example this is

1487
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,440
the situation of one round this is of

1488
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,199
two round and this is the situation of

1489
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,320
three rounds where this pink bar shows

1490
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,960
the neutral probability of flipping both

1491
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,500
the airspeed of Y and I plus 7 bits of X

1492
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,620
and this velvet bar shows the neutral

1493
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,020
probability of flipping the high speed

1494
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,199
of light the I plus 7 bits of X and the

1495
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,520
I plus 1 minus seven minus 2 is of Y so

1496
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,340
we get more General less new to B size

1497
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,920
but still they are not sufficient for

1498
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,500
boosting the weak signal if the eighth

1499
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,960
round neural distinguisher is used to

1500
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,020
attack morons so we introduce the

1501
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,320
condition of simultaneous neutral B size

1502
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,199
that is a set of Beats is neutral from

1503
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,600
for conforming pairs that fulfill some

1504
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,699
constraints

1505
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:39,179
to find them we investigate how the

1506
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:42,060
mutual ability new neutrality of each

1507
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,820
candidate speed site is influenced by

1508
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,820
the values of beats in some involved and

1509
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,820
controllable variables respect the

1510
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,280
consent variables are those involved in

1511
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,280
the first modular Edition

1512
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,739
specifically they are x y and x rotate

1513
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:02,460
by 7 position X or Y we observe that

1514
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:05,159
some probability neutral B size are

1515
01:18:05,159 --> 01:18:08,040
neutral for some conforming pairs but

1516
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,219
this conforming pairs have some specific

1517
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:15,840
bits are almost constant for example the

1518
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,860
B set by 5 and X12 is neutral with

1519
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,820
probability 0.5 when it is neutral the

1520
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:24,980
corresponding

1521
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:27,840
conforming pairs always have six speed

1522
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,739
with X or to one but overall conformium

1523
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:35,159
pairs the probability of this bit B1 is

1524
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:38,820
around 0.5 so we deduce that the

1525
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:42,239
condition for the B set by 5 x 12 having

1526
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,120
neutral probability one is having those

1527
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,960
conforming pairs with this bit xor 2 1.

1528
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,140
so with a automatic procedure and

1529
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,880
experimentally evaluates the conditional

1530
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,860
neutral probability of candidates

1531
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:03,060
besides with and fantier conditions for

1532
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,580
example this blue bar with a green

1533
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,620
border shows that the neutral

1534
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:14,159
probability of feed set X5 x 15 by 15 x

1535
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:18,420
6 x 8 is almost 1 but in the condition

1536
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:23,280
that y1 equals zero and this bar it

1537
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,300
shows that the neutral probability of y4

1538
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,980
X 11 X 13 is around

1539
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:35,940
0.91 in the condition that by 4 X or X11

1540
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,400
equals 1.

1541
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,040
in addition we found that it is possible

1542
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,560
that given an arbitrary conforming pairs

1543
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,800
of one differential flipping a bit and

1544
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,440
adjusting the input difference then get

1545
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,360
a conforming pair of another

1546
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,940
differential they share the same output

1547
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,199
difference

1548
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,239
the conforming pairs of the two

1549
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:58,860
differentials are one to one

1550
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,340
correspondence at this speeds thus the

1551
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,739
probability of the two differentials are

1552
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:07,199
the same because it's two differentials

1553
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,420
of joining differentials and causes

1554
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,820
speeds the switching bits for them

1555
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:14,460
such as pitching beads can play the same

1556
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,040
role as the neutral beats for doubling

1557
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,340
the size of a zephyr text structure he

1558
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,800
says we found there are differentials

1559
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,600
that share the same output difference

1560
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,600
have exactly the same set of useful

1561
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,239
neutral bit size and the difference of

1562
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,880
their input difference is one of their

1563
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,820
common neutral beads the was the pair of

1564
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,460
input pair is generated using the

1565
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,219
neutral bits for one differential one

1566
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,640
can repair the inputs and obtain a pair

1567
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,800
of input pairs for the other

1568
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,040
differential and assess by repairing one

1569
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,199
can reduce the data to double the number

1570
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:55,020
of set for text structures

1571
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,900
since one has to guess a few give you to

1572
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,600
use the conditional neutral decides we

1573
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,640
extend the differential neural key

to a structure of data pairs

the resulting structure of data pairs

1592

are decrypted by a free round and then

most specifically the key search

1599

1606
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,520

01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,820
the use of the safer Tech structure is

according to the max score of the Sub

how often they were visited the score of

1626
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,820
the recommended sub key is the command

1629
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:46,460
structure this score is highly selective

1630
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:50,280
decisive for the execution time and

1631
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,920
success rate of the attack because it

1632
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,960
will determine whether the recommended

1633
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,480
sub key will be further treated as the

1634
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,360
score passes the cutoff and the Maxi

1635
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:03,239
number also determines the priority of

1636
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:06,120
the safer Tech structure

1637
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,239
this is the

information on attacking travel

1642
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,540
so these are the application of this

Orthodox per recovery phase

1644
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,719
alongside this we provide substantial

1645
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,360
illustrations to unveil previously

1646
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,600
hidden details of these Orthodox key

1655
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:00,060

01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,760
turning critical parameters especially

1657
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,760
the cutoff C1 which determine the time

1658
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,600
complexity and success rate

1659
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,659
to answer the second question we devise

1660
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:15,600
the we produce whereas the new

1661

distinguishers around reduced statements

1662
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,199

01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:24,659
pure differential counterparts

1664
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:27,659
differential based counterpart we note

1665
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:30,780
that unlike spec for Siemens they are

01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:33,480
around the distinguisher accept values

1667
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,239

01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,760
simmer given the iron output without

1671
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,640
knowing the key one can directly reduce

1672
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,340
the r-managed Byron difference

1673
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:53,280
the comparison results show that they

1674
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,800
are around neurodextinguisher accepting

1675
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,520
values and are minus

1676
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,960
neurodextinguisher accepting partial

1677
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,480
value partial difference achieved

1678
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,699
similar but weaker classification

1679
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:08,880
accuracy than our minus one run DBT

1680
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,000
based distinguisher we conjecture that

1681
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,179
our round and this that accept values of

1682
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:19,440
several taxpayers could decrypt one and

1683
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,139
kid round and try to learn the four are

1684
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:24,060
managed by around output difference

1685
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,840
distribution but fail to learn more

1686
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,179
features beyond the distribution of

1687
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:31,500
differences

1688
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,840
it says using the differential neural

1689
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,940
crypto analysis framework with Device

1690
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,580
critical key recovery attacks covering

1691
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,940
16 rounds this indicates that the the

1692
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,620
differential neural equip analysis

1693
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,900
should work in general and modern

1694
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,960
suffers still their advantage might be

1695
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,540
either to show our Surfers whose

1696
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,820
differential-like properties cannot be

1697
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,760
accurately evaluated using existing

1698
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,739
doors

1699
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:02,219
and we we think enhancing the connection

1700
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:04,679
between traditional personalities

1701
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:06,840
techniques and machine learning

1702
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,600
approaches is helpful for achieving

1703
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,780
better crypto analysis results and this

1704
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,199
generalized neutral bits they are not

1705
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,340
intrinsically linked to neural network

1706
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:20,219
based on crypto analysis but are

1707
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:22,920
expected to be useful for converting a

1708
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,980
better range of weak distinguishers to

1709
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:29,340
competitive key recovery attacks the

1710
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,860
rules of some are turning parameters for

1711
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,100
Q recovery fees are far from perfect a

1712
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,280
Rogers serotic model and the relation

1713
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,620
between attack parameters attack

1714
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:44,040
complexities and success probability is

1715
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,040
still missing the building of which is

1716
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,199
left as future work

1717
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:52,519
thanks for your attention

1718
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,520
thank you very much are there any

1719
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,560
questions

1720
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,340
yes

1721
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,620
uh thank you for your presentation uh

1722
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,219
can you explain your environment for

1723
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:19,139
experiment

1724
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:23,040
and how to calculate the uh

1725
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,020
time complex thing constitutional

1726
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,639
complexity

1727
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,100
all of the experience the time

1728
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,820
complexity are obtained by running the

1729
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,139
data the

1730
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:39,120
the attack and the time it so and then

1731
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,340
translate to the equivalent number of

1732
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,340
encryptions for example for the tech on

1733
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:49,500
13 round we we run the

1734
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:57,199
attack uh 40 times on a GPU with the the

1735
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,440
100 with 100

1736
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,420
GPU card and

1737
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,179
and uh

1738
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:09,120
we present time the complexity uh the

1739
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,980
the time complexity

1740
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,300
and uh we compare the running time

1741
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:20,420
between uh on the GPU and on CPU

1742
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:26,600
and translate to if when encryption of

1743
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:31,020
one second can run 2 to the 28th

1744
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:35,960
encryption of spec then uh how how how

1745
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:41,280
many encryptions is equivalent to

1746
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,120
to the text so this is a pure

1747
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,120
experimental dependent

1748
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,719
evaluation of the time complexity

1749
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,000
okay

1750
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,620
the

1751
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,719
processing time

1752
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,840
of the near distinctions depend on

1753
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,920
the

1754
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,560
uh company environment right

1755
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,600
yes

1756
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:12,440
so the department of your attack is

1757
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,560
is it it differs

1758
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:20,100
uh on the Computing environment

1759
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:25,080
yes so we make some of the experiments

1760
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:31,800
on CPU some GPU and we try to

1761
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,340
compute the read and also we think this

1762
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,020
is the open problem on how to

1763
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:43,980
fairly compare the time complexity and

1764
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:48,179
we think a a theoretical model it will

1765
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:52,440
be very interesting so Behavior left it

1766
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,320
for future work I understand thank you

1767
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,440
any other questions

1768
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,440
if not then they thank all the speakers

1769
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,339
of the session again

1770
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:15,020
this concludes the decision
