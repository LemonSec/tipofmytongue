1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
first strategy

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,200
consists to prove a music standard

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,220
techniques that x times x minus 1 is

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,660
equal to 0 modulo sermon

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,679
Q Prime

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,039
where Q Prime is a prime number plus 2

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,260
am

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,660
it can be for example the next prime of

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,400
a

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,820
and we show that showing this uh

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,000
this constraint is sufficient to prove

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,260
that X is binary

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,920
the second strategy work as follow we

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,579
will ask we will get we're sharing of

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,820
the random mask R which is and tries to

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,040
be binary thanks to a cut and shoes

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,719
phase

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
then

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,460
we compute and reveal the mask version

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,600
of The Secret X name X styled as X the r

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,379
then we can deduce a sharing of X using

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,960
the above relation

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
since we know that X style is binary

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,280
and that our represented the binary

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,320
Vector thanks to the potential statement

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,400
we directly have that X is a binary

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
vector

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,920
using the previous strategy or this

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,979
strategy we can build

30
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,740
our MPC protocol then we can apply the

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,740
implicency Paradigm to get zero

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,479
knowledge proof accumulation for the

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,320
subset sum problem

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,939
when in the standard case use case

35
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,479
the very very fair valid except the

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,060
proof as soon as the

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,640
proverb does not abort during the two

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
repetition of the

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,180
protocol

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,200
in our case we will relax this statement

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,659
instead the verifier will validate the

42
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,060
proof as soon as we find the proofer

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,880
that's not about more than

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,459
ETA times where ETA is a parameter a new

45
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,720
parameter

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,900
it increased a bit soundness error but

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
it will check it will decrease a lot the

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,459
rejection rate

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,520
and it will provide better Traders than

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
simply increase the

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,879
the upper bound a

52
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,260
of the sharing scheme

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,500
here are the performances obtained

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,020
when building

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,459
proof of knowledge for the subset sum

56
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,720
problem

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,420
we can achieve communication cost below

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,019
20 kilobytes

59
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,200
and while the former schemes

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,500
have communication costs larger than 100

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,400
kilobytes

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,879
we applied our sharing technique to the

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,500
subset some cases

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
but

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
we in our work we show that we can apply

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,300
this sharing technique to other

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,360
application in our work we propose three

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,440
other application

69
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,840
the first one is to build zero knowledge

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,180
proof of knowledge for the short integer

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,040
solution problem

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,260
given Matrix a and Vector U the short

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,420
integer solution problem consists to

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,120
find a vector F so that we have this

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,180
linear relation and so that the infinity

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,459
Norm of s is less than some bound beta

77
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,920
then using exactly the same technique as

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,180
before

79
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,519
we can build zero noise proof of

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,659
knowledge for this problem

81
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,280
the performance is the obtained

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,379
performance is the following one we can

83
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,180
observe that we get a

84
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,780
efficient alternative in the case where

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,080
the ring is not smaller or entity

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,819
friendly

87
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,540
more precisely we can remark that the

88
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,760
proof size is independent of the ring

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,260
size

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,738
and so if we increase the ring size the

91
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,440
proof size will be the same and we will

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,540
be more competitive compared for example

93
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,880
with the others the former schemes

94
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,440
the second application is for the tfhg

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
context

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,740
for we in our work we build a protocol

97
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,199
to prove the knowledge of key plain text

98
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,500
path matching to a given Cipher text

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,139
and we gain a factor between 10 and 20

100
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,360
compared to for example the shamiers

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,580
protocol when we apply to Shamir

102
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,500
protocol to this use case

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,820
as last application we propose to build

104
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,660
an efficient signature scheme from

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,160
Bonnie Haleyville hum prf this prf

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,199
using a secret key X and the message M

107
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,320
output the most significant beta of the

108
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,940
inverse modulo P of X Plus m

109
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,740
the private key of our signature would

110
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,300
be this the secret key of the prf

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,240
and the public key of a signature would

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,880
be some outputs of this pref for public

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,479
constant 1 2 until t

114
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,560
and the signature

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,419
will be a non-interactive proof of

116
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,199
knowledge of the secret X and the less

117
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,380
significant bit of the inverse in the

118
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,240
in the prf

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,100
and so the proof proved that

120
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,520
if we combine concatenate so small less

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,380
significant bit with a more significant

122
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,160
bit we get the inverse of X plus the

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,479
message and we need to prove that Excel

124
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,919
Z1 Z2

125
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,419
is smaller and to prove that we use our

126
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,919
sharing schema

127
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
and since the for example Z1 will be

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,520
shared into a sum or small value we will

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,699
directly have that Z1 is smaller but

130
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,620
with some slack

131
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,199
and we will select our signature

132
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,699
parameters so that it is secure with the

133
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,720
slack against the known attacks against

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,500
the prf

135
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,880
the resulting

136
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,500
signature size of our scheme is around

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,639
five kilobytes which is competitive with

138
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,940
the current state of the art of the NPC

139
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,300
in the head base signature like Rainier

140
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,840
conclude

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,300
in this work we propose a new sharing

142
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,240
technique to share small value when

143
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
using large modulus

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,840
to avoid information leakage we we add a

145
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,699
rejection ruler

146
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,880
and then we can using this technique we

147
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,860
can drill

148
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,539
efficient zero knowledge proof of

149
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,300
knowledge for the case of the subset sum

150
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,740
problem

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,699
and with these other application like in

152
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,240
FHA of to build efficient signature

153
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
as best actually we can try to find

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
other application of this sharing

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,060
technique

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,919
and our signature schema could be a good

157
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,039
candidate for post Quantum schema but it

158
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,699
would be nice to have a Quantum Crypt

159
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,139
analysis for the bunny and arts prf

160
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,400
thank you for your attention

161
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,259
okay uh thanks for the talk uh are there

162
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,680
any questions

163
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,699
okay so maybe I'll start with one quick

164
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,199
question so

165
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
yeah you motivated this some problem and

166
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,539
you mentioned briefly that you you're

167
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,580
interested in the big modulus for

168
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,219
example due to the

169
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,440
256. is there any particular reason why

170
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,020
why we consider such big moduli

171
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,220
um it's because the

172
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,640
the cost of the sharing

173
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,760
um

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,940
well the cost of the sharing of set we

175
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,580
will scale with the size of the modulus

176
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,480
and since we are now independent to the

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
modulus queue we will be more efficient

178
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
with a very large queue

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,140
compared to if Q is a small

180
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,600
in practice we take a around 2 to 15.

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,779
2 to 15 years so equals

182
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,680
per bits per coordinated custom

183
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,959
15 bits

184
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,140
but in case of the subset summer the

185
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,800
previous technique used more than 200

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,740
bits so there is a very big

187
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,580
communication saving

188
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,880
the it's less impressive when we use

189
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,320
small uh modulus

190
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,019
okay uh and could you please

191
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,940
um show the slide with comparison with

192
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,760
other schemes like the lattices and

193
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,200
Aurora Leggero please

194
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,820
this one yeah so you mean that

195
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
in your protocol you can pick

196
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,100
so that sizes would

197
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
so could you repeat this uh your remark

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,899
about picking

199
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,700
um oh so you said that if you pick

200
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,740
bigger moduli then the proof size stays

201
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600
the same it's not yes and this is

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,779
independent of the ring size so if we

203
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,420
take a very larger we will be to the

204
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,500
zero the other scheme in the case of two

205
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,940
to 30 we will we are equivalent to

206
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,959
balance works but on larger field we

207
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,220
will outperform it was a

208
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,880
schema

209
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,060
since we are independent about the

210
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,399
of the ring size

211
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,260
and just out of curiosity if we just

212
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,380
take Q to be 2 to the 15 then

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,959
what will happen or like even smaller

214
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,440
15. yeah in fact our proof would be the

215
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,519
quite the same so okay you very

216
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,839
uncompetitive compares the state of the

217
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,660
atom

218
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,240
because yes we will have around 200

219
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,420
kilobytes even for the smaller

220
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,920
Q so yes the ID is very competitive only

221
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,740
on large field

222
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,260
okay thanks are there any other

223
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,500
questions

224
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,540
okay then let's thank the speaker again

225
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,860
so we have the next talk which is about

226
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,839
efficiency zero knowledge arguments in

227
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,880
discrete logarithm setting sub

228
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,000
logarithmic proof or sublinear verifier

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,600
uh it's worked by some Wok Kim Hyun bom

230
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,060
Lee and Jay Hong so

231
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,920
and hyung Bong will give a talk

232
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,959
hi everyone I'm humanri and I'm going to

233
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,540
talk about our paper if you're on the

234
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,880
general knowledge argument in discrete

235
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,639
logarithm setting so Global resume Pro

236
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,399
or soberanya verifier this work will

237
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,160
joined me some of Kim in Solomon

238
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,380
University and the Hong song in Highland

239
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,560
University

240
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm explaining genology argument for

241
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,220
Thursday briefly the generality argument

242
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,139
of

243
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,600
energy is a prop system between the

244
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,480
proper and the verifier the proper claim

245
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,540
the knowledge of weakness is satisfying

246
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,839
some relation given instance X

247
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,139
so generally argument of minority should

248
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,200
satisfies three properties conflict

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,540
needs no resoundness and general

250
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,120
knowledge

251
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,680
if the instance and maintenance is

252
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,440
belong to the relation the proper can

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
convince the verifier

254
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,019
and without knowledge of the witnesses

255
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,180
the sitting problem can convince the

256
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,660
verifier and general receive the proper

257
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,959
Pi review no information except progress

258
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,480
knowledge of weakness which is belonged

259
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,220
to the relation

260
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,100
and we call an argument is transparent

261
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,380
if the argument does not require trust

262
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,380
to third party for generating common

263
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,519
electron string CRS

264
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,300
and

265
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,980
now people introduce our contribution I

266
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,959
briefly explain in a project argument

267
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
IPA

268
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,579
so the inner product document is an

269
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,420
argument of Technology of two vectors

270
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,579
for their interface relation

271
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,760
the transparent in a product argument we

272
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,120
logarithm communication is introduced in

273
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,100
Euro script 16 and optimized version is

274
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,100
introduced in SNP 18 which is known as

275
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,440
reflux and I will call this

276
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,699
this bullet proof to ppip

277
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,060
and in a project argument to IPA is used

278
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,639
some application technology range

279
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,699
approved generation argumentable

280
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,380
arithmetic circuits and the learner is a

281
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,500
polynomial climate scheme here is a

282
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,380
reduction from technology argument for

283
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,199
arsenating to you know for document the

284
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,880
API so we focus on ppip and its variant

285
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,240
for constructing TKA general knowledge

286
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,600
argument

287
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,399
and this is

288
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,300
our contribution we propose three

289
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,260
transparent ipas first protocol 2 the

290
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,820
first IPA is sub algorithm communication

291
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,620
second protocol 3 the first IPA we solve

292
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,440
linear verifier under discrete log

293
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,300
assumption last protocol 4 introduced a

294
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,540
number method to achieve the soft linear

295
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,839
verifier IP without pairing

296
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,800
and this is the diagram for our

297
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,279
contribution first we observe the vpip

298
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,180
as two two-way communication and

299
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,699
verification after the

300
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,760
first generalization we construct

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,459
protocol one using common and proper

302
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,779
approach

303
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,380
but the protocol is one is

304
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,380
efficient as we wish it so additionally

305
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,820
we apply aggregation technique and

306
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,759
finally we get protocol 2. uh and

307
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
another from the another generalization

308
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,820
we construct protocol three by

309
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,820
substitution CRS and

310
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,720
shares and we propose new to tier

311
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,959
equipment without pairing and we adapt

312
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,120
this commitment to protocol 3 and

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,160
finally we get the protocol

314
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,619
now I explain protocol 2 server

315
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,900
algorithmic communication the blue one

316
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,679
is the keyword for the construction

317
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,419
protocol 2.

318
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,419
foreign

319
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,480
this is the observation for

320
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,020
communication with Pip the key idea of

321
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,600
logarithmic communication is witness

322
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
reduction the harm between its vectors A

323
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
and B and update to a had B had

324
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,660
recursively and a half per head are

325
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,799
updated by height of parallel formula

326
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,860
oh the proper should stand commitment to

327
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,120
cross terms I I notify this formula

328
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,480
Customs cross terms per round so total

329
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,660
communication or bpip is total rounds

330
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,960
time each reduction cost and which is 2

331
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,500
log n

332
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,140
then however reducing within its vectors

333
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,580
more shortly

334
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,059
we we construct generalized vpip

335
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,679
from Two and partition technique then we

336
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,580
expect to decrease total round to Blue

337
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,059
and base to n but each reduction cost

338
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,160
may increase

339
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
and

340
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,460
let's look at the more detail

341
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,860
Parts within inspector A and B to Twins

342
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,980
or vectors and update to a headpair

343
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,080
recursively and a head we had or updated

344
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,240
uh following the relation

345
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,480
so then the proper should send send

346
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,960
comments to cross term which is our 20

347
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,500
minus one curve elements per round for

348
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,480
constructing commitments to cross term

349
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,960
the proper comes or o is more than plus

350
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,960
n group exponentiation

351
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
and total communication is large times

352
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,200
is the reduction cost and the

353
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,280
communication is this and any n is one

354
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,299
is optimal value of total communication

355
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:23,940
so there is no merit to use two and

356
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,900
partition techniques

357
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,440
to to reduce communication course

358
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,799
we we apply committing proof approach

359
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,460
the proper standard short commitment

360
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,380
rather than sending 20 minus one through

361
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,100
very much we both without fee the

362
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,679
fortifier cannot update to next instance

363
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,660
P hat

364
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,880
then how to construct a reduction

365
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,600
protocol the solution is that the

366
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,960
proportion updated instant P hat with

367
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,720
profile after receiving income challenge

368
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,320
challenges uh the profile is

369
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,539
propagnology B such that here is p to X

370
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,860
which X is public from the challenges

371
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,179
so

372
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,160
from construct profile we construct the

373
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,919
multi-exponential argument me a and mea

374
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,980
can construct similar way to IPA

375
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,900
next

376
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,120
then after applying dominant probe

377
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,240
approach then for each round the

378
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
progress and commitment and update

379
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,160
instance we had and improve time whose

380
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,100
size is all those Moran then total

381
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,980
communication of a protocol one is or

382
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,400
role as n in terms of communication cost

383
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,780
protocol 1 is the same as vpip

384
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,960
to reduce communication more we apply

385
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,820
aggregation technique

386
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,580
the organization technique is generating

387
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,760
one operator probe or multiple relations

388
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,460
this is a diagram for protocol 1 and 2

389
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,660
in protocol 1 after the commutative

390
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,000
approach the proportion

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,720
commitment and update the instance P

392
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,240
head and Pi original original after the

393
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,460
aggregation technique

394
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,880
so approvals same coin Mountain P hat or

395
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,700
reach around and the last round the

396
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,840
proper then aggregate probe

397
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,620
and the complexity is this and let's

398
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,380
focus on communication costs so around

399
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,600
the reduction in random relation the

400
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,480
communication cost is all wrong plus n

401
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,500
base to n and operation probe there is

402
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,640
proper communication code is all role as

403
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,020
n based customer to n plus local n and

404
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,320
total communication cost is this and

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,440
let's smallen is 2 to the square root

406
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,220
program then we get all square root of n

407
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,659
communication

408
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,419
for the total proper complexity is

409
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,320
increased to all rather than n times 2

410
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,320
to the square root of n this is a kind

411
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,299
of trade-off to proper complexity and

412
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,179
communication cost

413
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,980
next protocol 3 sovereign

414
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,580
and use them as common reference three

415
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,980
now for each round the program by

416
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,520
parallel have grew very much GNH and

417
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,159
update to G hat h8 following the formula

418
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,500
this update requires 20

419
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,280
group exponential exponential

420
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,860
which is a linear to avoid linear

421
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,559
verification we consider to change CRS

422
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,740
from

423
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,640
uh to change shortest form are introduce

424
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,260
new notion out the repairing product

425
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,580
let's G1 G2G TV group of prime model P

426
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,500
with biolog a and let's define the auto

427
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,919
programming product for group element G

428
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,480
and Lot H Define G times G times H is

429
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,840
this this is this is a kind of

430
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,299
Chronicle product

431
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,260
and let's n is

432
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,860
M times n is your vectoral length of our

433
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,760
IPA then how about using G times H H

434
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,580
times H rather than GH which is

435
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,658
angle very much on ppip

436
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,400
ppip provide the resistance under

437
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,620
discrete logarithm relation assumption

438
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,679
and it is known as their assumption is

439
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,440
equivalent to data assumption there are

440
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,860
assumptions is this it is interactive to

441
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,620
find a non-trivial relation

442
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,820
such that g to the G is identity

443
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,360
so so we

444
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,100
we construct new theorem we stated and

445
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,120
proved this theorem for other

446
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,659
um

447
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:53,880
uh for adapt had a

448
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,360
to to prove sound downloading of our

449
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,740
protocol so the DRM guarantees harness

450
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,860
of finding non-tribulation of g10dh

451
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,980
which is guaranteed the sound is over

452
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,380
our protocol

453
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,039
then and we use tomorrow G and H and

454
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,100
large H as CRS of our no protocol

455
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,900
argument IPA protocol 3.

456
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,059
and this is a kind of visualization of

457
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,900
protocol 3 first start the row reduction

458
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,980
so it

459
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,480
Fitness matrices is hard to hyperal

460
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,279
matrices and program modifier

461
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,679
so G1 or jump part in CRS and keeping G2

462
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
part

463
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,419
and after the low reduction

464
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,539
the problem but if I are on column

465
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,559
reduction

466
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,720
and keeping the G1 G1 part is just type

467
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,200
the to G2 part

468
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,340
and the complexity is this uh focus on

469
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,659
the verification

470
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,380
in no reduction the modification is o m

471
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,720
and so in column reduction the

472
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,840
verification cost is o n so the total

473
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,380
verification quality is o m n plus n and

474
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,919
less m equals n equal to n then we get

475
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,080
all square root n multiplication which

476
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,918
is sub-reneur

477
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,039
next I'll explain protocol so our new

478
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,799
modifier without hearing

479
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,220
this is another view of protocol 3. and

480
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,940
in protocol 3 we construct G times H for

481
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,860
requirement to

482
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,539
Matrix a

483
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,020
the another view is two-tier coin

484
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,539
Hotel appointment is three months we are

485
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,799
two steps

486
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,820
first for all the column vectors of

487
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,000
Matrix a and commit to column vectors is

488
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,440
a using patterns common after the coin

489
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,679
first coin First Step commit the results

490
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,820
of first coin modes using afgho climate

491
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,039
which is which is pairing

492
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,419
no two common

493
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,960
the result without pairing we consider a

494
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,539
command to electrical point

495
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:28,020
there are two electrical representation

496
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,700
of any presentation on GQ

497
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,220
tickets care and protective

498
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,039
representation on gqb

499
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,260
it is hard to represent

500
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,840
point at Infinity from a pin

501
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,059
implementation in in both there is a

502
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,240
complete edition formula from protective

503
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,440
representation

504
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,840
so we consider

505
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,419
the projective representation or

506
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,500
elliptical

507
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,200
from protective representation we

508
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,820
consider electrical as a vector in

509
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,700
particular cubic and then apply First

510
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,320
Command to the vector

511
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,340
as I introduced our new two-tier homic

512
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,220
first set of parallel left curve GP and

513
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,620
GQ

514
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,179
which is elliptical of order p and Q and

515
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,340
the GP is electrical or worship Q and

516
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,740
after post going on consider the result

517
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,640
group elements has vectors over TQ and

518
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,940
other apply second common pattern

519
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,279
command based on GQ

520
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,620
and the appointment guarantees binding

521
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,400
of a message but not provide config

522
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,260
profile hopefully property

523
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,539
without homographic property the

524
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,720
modifier cannot update P hat which is

525
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,539
similarly rich in protocol 1.

526
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,380
so we apply committing proper protein

527
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,059
similarly in protocol one

528
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,760
Temple reach around the proper send

529
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,539
updated instance we had with Prof pi to

530
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,080
double player after using committed

531
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,679
approaching total process is all logos

532
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,000
square and

533
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,120
to to reduce total approxide more we

534
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,980
apply aggregation technique like

535
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,000
protocol 2.

536
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
then what should the property combine

537
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,720
the proper IE to

538
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,480
convince that the result of electrical

539
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,020
points satisfy elliptical relation the

540
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,679
instance is limited q and the weakness

541
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,520
is element of GP and

542
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,760
the last one is the coimage of small

543
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,399
letters

544
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,279
uh and but the process is this the

545
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,340
represent electrical relations using

546
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,399
complete addition formula and use

547
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:20,340
or converted from complete edition

548
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,059
formula then the proof size is all logos

549
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,700
for n and modification is om

550
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,299
so from this thing we construct two

551
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,580
argument multi electrical argument for

552
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,940
low reduction and column reduction

553
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,080
this is a visualization for protocol

554
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,440
first order commuting proof approach

555
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,880
propose and

556
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,179
and RP head and the pro for each round

557
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,100
but we apply aggregation technique more

558
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,460
and actually the progress and the air

559
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,520
RRP head and last round

560
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,820
the operation the aggregate Pro

561
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,460
and this is the complexity the total

562
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,059
communication is over MN and the total

563
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:14,159
verification is for M plus n log M let m

564
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,399
equal n equals square root n then we get

565
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:22,760
o square root of n log n multiplication

566
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,460
so this is conclusion we propose three

567
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,760
transparent ipas which can be combined

568
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,659
to reduction gka to IPA from the

569
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,659
reduction we construct three technology

570
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:37,919
arguments

571
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,380
first generation argument with server

572
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,899
logarithmic communication as far as we

573
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,760
know this is the first server

574
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,899
logarithmic

575
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:50,580
TKA in transparent settings second Decay

576
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
with sub-linear verifier and deltier

577
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,340
assumption although the argument use

578
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,340
pairing operation its soundness is based

579
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,559
on disk logarithm assumption

580
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,039
make sure him there are another sub

581
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,679
linear verifier dka under their

582
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
assumption

583
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,500
and more assumption but we we proved

584
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,380
that their assumption is enough to

585
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,620
support linear modifier to Ka and rust

586
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,200
uh TKA with solving your profile with

587
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,500
pairing without Radiance of pairings we

588
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,779
show possibility of sub linear verifier

589
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,260
in the disk Row setting

590
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,000
thank you for attention to my

591
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,480
presentation

592
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,439
foreign

593
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,320
thank you for your talk

594
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,220
um are there any questions

595
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,020
okay um let me start with one

596
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,960
so um could you please comment on the

597
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,419
comparison of the knowledge soundness

598
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,179
error of protocols two three and four

599
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,460
with bulletproofs

600
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,000
yeah oh the

601
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
the comparison

602
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,659
uh

603
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,679
in my memory I

604
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,380
did

605
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,519
this content is in our paper so

606
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,500
briefly say so actually the

607
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,159
something is

608
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,500
occurred to broadcast and for about

609
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,080
one over two maybe

610
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,919
and so more detail please check our

611
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,399
different different paper

612
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,100
so just just to make sure is it going to

613
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,679
be the same as for bulletproofs or is it

614
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,539
slightly larger obviously it's

615
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,820
negligibility larger but uh rather horse

616
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,500
or neglecture

617
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,659
okay are there any more questions

618
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,380
okay so let's thank the speaker again

619
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,620
foreign

620
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,599
okay so the next the last talk is online

621
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,639
uh non-interactive zero knowledge proves

622
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,918
to multiple verifiers

623
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,859
and this is paper by Kang Yang and Xiao

624
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,159
Wang

625
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,020
and Kang will give a talk

626
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,099
okay do you see my skin

627
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,639
yes

628
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,139
okay

629
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,239
hello everyone I'm Kanye from fifth key

630
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,460
laboratory of Corrections this is the

631
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,200
John work with Xiao Wang from

632
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,020
Northwestern University our work is

633
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,119
entitled a long drug deal with their

634
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,900
large proof to multiple Rivers thank you

635
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,480
theology proved the new approved over

636
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,520
two comments of verifier a statement

637
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,160
that is true here statement X is often

638
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,920
represented by Circuit W is called

639
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,740
waitlist in this case at estw status by

640
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,200
an MP relationship in the equivalent to

641
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,700
CW is equivalent if equal to zero they

642
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,859
can prove to lead to third by three

643
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,839
properties the fact that you complete

644
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,740
with means when they provide actually

645
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,660
includes the protocol

646
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,839
they're very far must must accept the

647
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,359
second instant list means the malicious

648
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,940
approver cannot convince them unless the

649
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,099
other part of first statement is true

650
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,680
the third is their knowledge means the

651
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,839
malicious verifier cannot learn any

652
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,900
information except the statement is true

653
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,960
allows the communication between

654
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,119
approval and the welfare to be

655
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,640
non-interactive another idea is a public

656
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,000
people publicly verifiable and approved

657
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
for computer used to commence multiple

658
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,020
reports

659
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,260
and approve their efficiency of online

660
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,480
they can contains significantly improved

661
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
under different Frameworks such as NPC

662
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,000
in the head gkr IOP and so on

663
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,880
designated verified

664
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,680
offer an interactive protocol between

665
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,740
approver and the Web Bar

666
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,260
dvdk can convince only one very far or

667
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,619
every time dvdk can be constructed under

668
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,380
different works such as double circuits

669
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,060
very easily and from

670
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,380
any number of rare parts

671
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,099
compared to analysis dvdk has a faster

672
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,800
approved time faster total times more

673
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,180
memory

674
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,540
therefore an IDK and a dvdk have

675
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,619
different efficiency features

676
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,560
welcome to explore the middle ground

677
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,859
between nidk and dvdk particularly we

678
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,380
study the efficiency of Decay proof when

679
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,200
the approver wants to convince multiple

680
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,380
where fast that is mvdk

681
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,500
we allow the adversely to cropped up to

682
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,619
T of The Unborn under this crop it where

683

00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,420
clear streaming approved means the

693

697
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,260
in the MLA case 18 there are two types

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,480
of communications one is between the

699

700
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,760
the amount different parts if the

701
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
approver only sends one message into

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,740
every verifier than the protocol user

703

questions also work for our framework

788
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,359
for secret X we use square square

789
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,420
bracket of x to develop a theorem of X

790

794
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,020
use the distributed Decay that is

798
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,520
to achieve strongly long interactive we

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,980
unnecessary to be clear in resultant

854
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,800
and its sufficient to

855
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,579
guarantee random output so we can adopt

856
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,160
Lambda rather 2 Lambda as the output

857
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,180
lens

858
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,480
more importantly the construction

859
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,000
dealers are 17 based on face key ideas

860
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,619
can be used

861
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,500
the communication overhead is the N2

862
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,060
Lambda bits is small

863
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:47,700
the first two online emulate Capital

864
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,060
cost adoption series

865
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,359
a t degree polynomial f is compute such

866
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,780
as F 0 is the state of secret s and the

867
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,980
ffi is the share of a verified I we can

868
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,680
generalize The xiaomi Experience into

869
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,720
pocket Assurance to sit in case decrease

870
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,200
in different operations that is we can

871
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,140
see it as beta I equal to secret s i the

872
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,220
downside is lower corrupting threshold

873
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,920
we often use a square bracket of vector

874
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,900
X to delote a particular theorem

875
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,540
when using packet experience in MDK

876
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,140
protocol we can perform addition or

877
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,240
multiplication operation for a group of

878
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,660
K G case every time if they package

879
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,079
serum doesn't exist proverb is to

880
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,140
generate and distribute y for every

881
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,420
group

882
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,220
learning this some wires are in

883
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,980
different groups that will lead to proof

884
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,260
consistency of their values in different

885
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,540
groups

886
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,900
particularly proverb is to prove the

887
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,359
correct list of one purpose a white

888
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,540
Tuple is x y i j such as x i equal to YG

889
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,200
for each IGA plan belongs to 1 2K

890
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,900
they very firstly to check a consistency

891
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,460
and wire taples with the same indices IG

892
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,040
this can be done by random linear

893
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,240
compilation

894
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,020
that is X is equal to sum of H multiply

895
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,480
x h plus X zero

896
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,540
Y is the compute similarly then where

897
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,920
first can open X Y and Y to check x i

898
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,839
equal to y j

899
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,680
here x0 and Y 0 are random series such

900
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,359
as X zero I equal to Y zero J so the

901
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,760
the relative property is granted

902
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,339
to generate the challenge Alpha equal to

903
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:00,300
h plus u v i j pair you with the public

904
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,780
messages to General Assurance of x0 and

905
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,579
Y zero

906
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,060
as we allow a port we use we can use

907
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,000
equal broadcaster per charcoal the

908
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,160
hatching of messages is sent when

909
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,400
opening Series therefore we can keep one

910
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,680
round of communication between their

911
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,160
facts

912
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,900
to check correctly the over particular

913
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,940
multiplication purpose the parties

914
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,359
perform pocket multiplication tables

915
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:33,060
into a pocket inner product

916
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,859
couple now the party is okay

917
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,740
hold the series of X1 to X and y1 to

918
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,460
Byron are they here they equal to X sum

919
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,339
of x i star y I understand is the

920
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,680
component one instance product

921
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,260
then they were first round of record

table two two the reason Logan minus one

925
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,000
iterations without any traction

926
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,060
particularly for Italy iterations with a

927
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,240
packet purple into two public couples

928
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,980
then compressed to

929
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,520
couples with Dimension M into one Tuple

930
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,740
with Dimension M over 2.

931
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,720
with Dimension 2 this red randomization

932
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,359
is done using a random type of generator

933
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,180
by proverb the parties accomplished the

934
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,240
speed tables along the random typo into

935
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,819
one pocket type

936
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,460
then they they open their without

937
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,760
intable to check Z equal to X star y

938
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,619
the remaining task is to show how to

939
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,619
realize the lung interactive compression

940
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:52,440

00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,119
realize the long interactive compression

944
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:04,800
typically will lead to compressed two

945
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,260
packet you know inner product tuples

946
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,540
into one table

947
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,859
all right

948
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,520

computer assuming of polynomial gjs such

953
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,300
as GT are equal to b i j then the

integral C for another patch the parties

972
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,000
perform the same operations to after

973
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,240
other packet type of IP top 2 will

974
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,000

Dimension and over two c

978
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,200
in this way very little we only need one

979
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,680
round between reversible or patches the

980
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,540
memory is over and clear n is the

981
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,720
parameter can be said according to the

982
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,200
memory style a similar idea can be used

983
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,839
for consistent check of wiretapples

999
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,079
thanks for your attention the

1000
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,240
formulation can be found at different if

1001
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,819
you have any questions then send emails

1002
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:56,540
to me thanks

1003
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,720
okay thanks for your talk are there any

1004
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,020
questions

1005
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,040
so I just have a quick question so you

1006
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,040
said that two protocols

1007
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,619
uh the two new protocols they rely on

1008
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:24,359
they have this computational security

1009
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,880
right yes

1010
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,119
this means that the the I guess

1011
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,780
so this relies on

1012
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,380
uh yeah

1013
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,540
which so that means that soundness

1014
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,020
relies on some computational assumption

1015
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:47,940
uh low uh because I we see they are in

1016
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,619
the computational security system

1017
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,859
because we use a random Oracle uh so

1018
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,319
so the automatically must be polomial

1019
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,760
time

1020
