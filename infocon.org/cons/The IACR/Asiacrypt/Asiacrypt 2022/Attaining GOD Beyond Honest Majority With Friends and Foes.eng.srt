00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,300
hello everyone I am shravani patil and

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,680
today I'll be presenting our work

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,660
attaining God Beyond honest majority

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,639
with friends and force

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,800
let me Begin by defining secure

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
multi-party computation or MPC

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,260
MPC allows and mutually distrusting

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,260
parties say P1 to PN each holding a

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,240
private input to compute a joint

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,160
function of their inputs

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,439
this distressed among parties is modeled

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,480
as a centralized adversary which can

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,939
corrupt T out of the N parties

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,940
any MPC protocol is required to satisfy

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,880
the following properties correctness of

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,700
output computation and privacy that is

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,140
nothing beyond the function output

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,620
should be revealed to the adversity

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,480
although the classical definition of

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,460
security takes into account what is

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,620
revealed to the adversary it does not

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,000
account for the information leakage

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,940
towards the honest parties that is an

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
adversary can leak information towards

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,199
honest Parties by sending across its

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,940
entire View and this wouldn't be

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,760
considered as a privacy breach in fact

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,159
this loophole in the security definition

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,920
has been leveraged by several protocols

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,780
in the literature especially those for

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,479
small population NPC to achieve the

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,159
strongest security of guaranteed output

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,860
delivery or got which ensures that the

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
honest parties receive their output

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,659
irrespective of the adversary strategy

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,420
the way these protocols achieve it is

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,939
that they require all the parties to

38
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,979
send their private inputs to a

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,200
designated party which is identified as

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
a trusted party or a TTP

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,979
now although this helps in achieving DOD

42
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,320
in Practical scenarios where MPC is

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,780
deployed the parties may actually be

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,420
servers owned by different companies in

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,759
this case revealing information to other

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
parties is not a viable solution

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,960
this is where the notion of friends and

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,540
Force Security defined by Elon at all

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,360
comes into the picture here instead of

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,600
out considering every party to be purely

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,060
honest they try to model every party as

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,758
at least being semi honest and towards

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,459
this in addition to considering a

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,260
malicious advisory which can corrupt tea

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
parties they consider another adversary

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,260
which can semi honestly corrupt up to

57
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
its star of the remaining parties

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,000
to capture view leakage the malicious

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,220
advisory is allowed to send its entire

60
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,980
view to the semionist parties and now

61
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,959
the security is required to hold in the

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,020
face of both these adversaries

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,959
in fact in the work by elonitol they

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,500
also show that fairness or DOD is

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,260
possible if and only if 2T plus h star

66
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,260
is less than n in this setting

67
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,879
now given that this is a more

68
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,120
practically relevant notion of security

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,860
we focus on achieving friends and poor

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,420
Security in our work

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,700
in fact our contributions in this work

72
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,019
are twofold

73
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,060
on the theoretical side we show the

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,700
necessity of optimist transfer OT for

75
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,160
constructing a generic T comma star FF

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
secure protocol when n is lesser than or

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,780
equal to 2T plus two eight star note

78
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,220
that this subsumes the optimal

79
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,920
corruption threshold of 2T Plus 8 star

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,980
given this on the Practical side we

81
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,900
focus on the MPC for small population

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,959
setting and construct our four-party

83
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,239
protocol Quad Squad which is secure

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,519
against one malicious and one semionis

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,800
corruption in the friends and Force Mode

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,659
we have two variants of our protocol

87
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,000
Fair as well as God

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
note that the corruption threshold we

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,200
have considered is optimal as per the

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,019
bounds given in an on at all's work

91
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,780
further to ensure efficiency of our

92
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,400
protocol we operate in the

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,620
pre-processing Paradigm and construct

94
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,720
the protocol over rings to leverage the

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
CPU architecture

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,860
and finally we show the application of

97
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,540
our protocol in the domain of privacy

98
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,700
preserving machine learning to show its

99
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,540
practical relevance

100
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,220
We compare our protocol to the

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,200
state-of-the-art four-party protocols in

102
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,700
the honest majority as well as the

103
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,099
dishonest majority setting

104
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,680
we note that our pair as well as DOD

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,959
protocol have a comparable online cost

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
to that of the honest majority protocols

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,060
while tackling a stronger adversary with

108
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,760
an additional semi honest corruption

109
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,979
and although the pre-processing cost of

110
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,199
our protocol is higher in comparison to

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,900
them this is justified by the necessity

112
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,520
of oblivious transfer which you have

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,020
already proven

114
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
on the other hand both are protocols

115
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,540
outperform the dishonest majority

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,060
protocol of mascot in the pre-processing

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,220
as well as the online phase while

118
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,199
elevating the security guarantee from

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,860
abort to got

120
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,960
as mentioned before we have benchmarked

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,220
our protocol for the neural network

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,919
inference task over the MS data set

123
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,380
and here as well we know that although

124
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,360
the total communication cost of a

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,340
protocol is higher than the ons majority

126
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,740
protocols this is primarily due to the

127
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,300
pre-processing cost

128
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,820
in fact the online communication is

129
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,680
still comparable to the honest majority

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,380
settings and this makes our protocol a

131
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,300
practically viable option especially

132
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,160
given the stronger adversarial notion

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
that it considers the code for our

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,300
protocol is publicly available at the

135
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,979
following week

136
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,639
thank you
