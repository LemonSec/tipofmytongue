1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,340
dude there's going to be beer throughout

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,920
the ram session over there and so you're

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,899
free to go there anytime and the the

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,179
general chair promised us that there's

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,760
enough beer for everyone so please

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,080
challenge that

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,719
there's also still food outside until

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,760
nine o'clock so if you're still hungry

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,039
you can go there and get some some more

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,240
food

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,340
and now I think we can get started with

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,140
some official business and I would like

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,720
to firsthand the stage to to the general

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,320
chairs

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,480
foreign

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,039
so we are the general chairs if you

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
haven't figured out

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,019
and that's I mean and that's me boy Yin

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,159
and uh and like the fake the basic

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,659
figures of this uh

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
patient Crypt is that we have lots of

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,159
attendees 251 and there's uh

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,340
104 students and we gave headed out

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,259
quite a few stipends

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,060
there are 159 that's nearly 160 for

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,320
workshops

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,780
of which uh 20 only signed for workshops

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,560
and nothing else

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,380
a breaker tank of those guys who showed

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,520
up so this is the total number

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,460
and now you look at it and and think

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,540
that it doesn't look so strange

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,899
uh and the thing is this is the total

34
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,560
number including remote attendees

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,820
yeah

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,920
so and there is 457 attendees including

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
remote

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,340
the I mean of course locals are the I

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,860
mean the most numerous because it's

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,459
easiest for us to be here I mean and the

41
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,420
the USA has the next higher number and

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,680
uh I mean it and it goes down with Korea

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,180
and Japan Korea China France Germany I

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,319
mean The Usual Suspects

45
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,879
uh if we look at on-site people only

46
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,540
then we realize that maybe a quarter is

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
local

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,900
and Korea and I really love Koreans they

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,580
showed up for our Asia Crypts in such

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,840
Force

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,519
I mean and then there is uh 26 from the

52
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,640
U.S and there's I mean you know again

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,140
the eugeot suspects and we have to ex

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,900
apologize uh that only

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,280
I mean one person from Hong Kong and no

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,800
person from mainland China was able to

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,540
make it and I mean we know that they had

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,200
I mean the zero covet policy and uh so

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,700
that maybe 30 or or 40 people that would

60
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,620
otherwise like to come

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,720
and so all in all it's not a bad number

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,620
that's showing up here and that's

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,860
basically it and we will turn this over

64
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,379
to chueta

65
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,159
foreign

66
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,920
uh

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,500
hi everybody I'm very happy to be here

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,480
and to see you all here

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,519
let me tell you a little bit about the

70
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,780
program chairs perspective

71
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,540
okay so uh this is not moving okay good

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,660
so we had more submissions ever uh this

73
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,780
is 363 which is up from 341 last year

74
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,300
which is up from three one six the year

75
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,560
before that so roughly 25 papers more uh

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,680
each year we also had the most accepted

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,340
papers ever uh so we accepted 98 papers

78
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,320
which is roughly the same as what we

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,139
accepted last year which is above what

80
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,479
we accepted the year before that uh

81
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,520
we've had the largest program committee

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,300
so 82 fantastic researchers helped us

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,880
select a strong program uh this is up

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,020
from 74 last year and one uh one new

85
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,360
thing that we did this Asia Crypt new in

86
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
the context of Asia trip is that we had

87
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,040
an interactive rebuttal phase so this is

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,740
an idea that we borrowed from crypto and

89
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,940
ccs

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,280
and we modified it a little bit so in

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
our Liberty phase we made the entire

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,380
State available including the scores and

93
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,120
all the reviews were available to the

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,460
authors and you had a week to discuss

95
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,560
interactively with the reviewers you

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,900
know to clarify anything about your

97
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,259
paper uh I hope very much that this

98
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,780
helped everybody feel that their paper

99
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,979
was reviewed fairly

100
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,639
a little bit of statistics

101
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,620
so uh yeah we we had a two round uh we

102
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,800
had a two round uh

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,380
you know decision phase in the first

104
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,080
round we rejected 140 papers so here the

105
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
logic as you can imagine was that uh

106
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
it it's beneficial for the authors

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,780
because you can work start working on

108
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,820
your papers early it's beneficial for

109
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,500
the program committee because they can

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
focus all their attention on the papers

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,380
that remain then we rejected 125 in the

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,039
next round we accepted uh 98 as I

113
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,740
already said one was a soft merge so

114
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,780
there are 97 talk slots in the

115
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,180
conference nine papers were accepted

116
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,400
with shepherdy

117
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,300
um

118
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,240
the average PC load was quite decent so

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,900
14 to 15 papers in terms of PC diversity

120
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,419
we tried really really hard to have as

121
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
diverse a program committee as possible

122
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,060
so geographically we we managed to do a

123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,880
pretty good job uh the gender ratio was

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,419
not not so good even though uh I

125
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,639
personally tried very hard but we only

126
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,940
managed to get 20 women that that

127
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,280
includes me

128
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,199
uh in terms of seniority area of

129
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,720
expertise industry Academia again the

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,900
balance was not bad

131
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,380
a review process details uh 363

132
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,020
submissions as I said we worked really

133
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,479
hard to ensure that every paper had at

134
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,479
least three reviews and uh some papers

135
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,340
even had four reviews

136
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,860
uh PC members were allowed to submit at

137
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,979
most two papers the acceptance rate was

138
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,539
27 percent

139
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,120
this is a little lower than last year's

140
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,039
because the number of submissions was

141
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,620
higher uh the interactive rebuttal I

142
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,660
already told you about this was one week

143
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,419
and the authors got to see the full

144
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,280
reviews

145
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
uh two invited talks so uh uh Damien's

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
Deli this is yet to come the efficient

147
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
lattice based encryption uh Gian guo we

148
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,020
already saw this today evolution of

149
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,900
cryptanalysis uh we have 14 parallel

150
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,419
sessions we have a cool afternoon

151
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,199
Excursion planned uh tomorrow the the

152
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,840
fun Ram session which I'm holding you

153
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
back from at the moment and uh yeah that

154
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,740
the chairs are Khan and Matthias as you

155
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,580
know

156
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,220
so thanks very much to them and the

157
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,199
three award papers you already know the

158
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,360
best paper award went to this paper by

159
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,699
uh heart and Mark uh full Quantum

160
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,860
equivalence of group action discrete log

161
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,520
and CDH and more uh the earlier early

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,620
career award went to cryptographic

163
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,139
Primitives with a hinting property this

164
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,599
is uh Navid alamati and Shikhar Patra

165
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,640
now this the Journal of cryptology

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
invitation paper was Swift DC I will not

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,299
try to pronounce the rest of it uh so

168
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,200
this was by uh uh Jorge Francisco and

169

180
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,700
publication and uh last but very far

181
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,279
from the least Kevin McCurley and K

182

McKelly who work really really hard to

183
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,260
you know keep the systems going they've

184
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,180
really been an invaluable help and I

185
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,860
thank them from the bottom of my heart

186
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,260
and thanks to all of you for showing up

187
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,000
and I hope you're having a good time

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,019
thank you

189
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,860
foreign award

190
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,000
so uh a little bit about this award

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,820
this is given yearly for each one of the

192
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,580
three iscr General conferences uh Euro

193
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,880
crypto and Asia Crypt and uh as you

194
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
might know this is given to a paper

195
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,660
which has had a lasting impact on the

196
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,940
field for the last 15 years

197
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,540
uh yeah so you you can yeah I already

198
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,880
said this so instead of X and Y I mean

199
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,580
last 15 years so you know we're choosing

200
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,220
the the most impactful paper it's

201
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,240
selected by a yearly rotating committee

202
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,899
uh this year's committee uh comprised of

203
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,920
these folks uh so Nigel Causeway myself

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,600
Stefan and Thomas shrimpton and uh this

205
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,540
year's test of time award uh goes to uh

206
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,600
Daniel Bernstein and Tanya Lange for

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,120
their paper faster Edition and doubling

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,660
of uh on ellipticals

209
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,440
and this paper uh has had a huge impact

210
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,260
on the field as evidenced in part by its

211
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,399
very high citations uh the paper uh is

212
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,519
very important for introducing efficient

213
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,380
elliptic curve Edition formulas in the

214
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,019
context of Edward forms of elliptic

215
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,040
curves

216
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,500
and unfortunately the authors were not

217
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,279
able to be here in person but uh this is

218
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,620
the certificate that we present to them

219
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,800
okay

220
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
here online

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
yeah yes are you here uh Daniel and

222
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,079
Tanya would you like to say a few words

223
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,240
yes we would be happy to can you see us

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,220
can you hear us yes yes we can so

225
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,100
congratulations from all of us oh yeah

226
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,779
thanks thanks very much

227
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,579
um yeah the story of this paper really

228
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,980
begins of course with Harold Edwards uh

229
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,260
for for us well first we heard about it

230
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,660
he was giving a talk on addition on

231
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,019
elliptic Curves in Leiden and he was

232
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,360
saying here's this curve shape and this

233
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,459
set of elliptic curves and here is this

234
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,800
addition formula and has anybody seen

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,880
this before

236
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,160
and now he must have thought we weren't

237
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,660
paying attention because we were

238
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,100
immediately

239
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,680
figuring out how fast you could do

240
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,500
elliptic curve Point Edition and on this

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,860
curve shape and immediately realizing

242
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
that this was faster than anything else

243
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,480
that was out there so it must be new if

244
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,980
it's faster than anything else out there

245
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,800
and uh well so so we were able to

246
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,320
happily tell them yeah it must be new

247
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,940
because otherwise

248
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,500
um if it were known then we would

249
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,420
already have these speeds for adding

250
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,959
points on elliptic curves well

251
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,779
sorry so because we were clapping with

252
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,360
the first few words you said who is the

253
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
person you're talking about it's about

254
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
Harold Edwards

255
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,100
yes yes yes yes we'll give you a talk in

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,260
2007 and it turned out that he had been

257
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,380
working on this for 10 12 years and he

258
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,120
even had tried to submit to journals and

259
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,279
got rejected with this must be well

260
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,920
known and so he was very humble and very

261
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
modest and asked me has anybody seen

262
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
those and as then just explained we

263
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,560
could give him a quick confirmation that

264
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,660
no if anybody had seen those then

265
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,339
elliptical photography would be much

266
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,000
faster now he had by then gotten his

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
paper accepted

268
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,019
on the on the PMS side and we were doing

269
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,339
there with the Curve formulas and we

270
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,800
really tried to get him on this paper

271
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
and him being a very modest and humble

272
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,399
person he didn't want to on the other

273
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,800
hand uh and maybe this uh turned out

274
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,320
more beneficial to him this way we could

275
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,420
name the curse after him so that's why

276
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,040
they're called editors

277
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,920
very nice and of course obviously we

278
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,019
should also thank all the the students

279
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,019
who were helping out with optimizing

280
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,959
things even more and of course various

281
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,540
follow-up papers of uh making Edward's

282
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,180
curves even faster yeah and well thank

283
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,860
you very much to the selection committee

284
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,800
and to have whoever nominated us thank

285
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
you very much it's uh nice to see this

286
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
recognition

287
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,420
thank you so much

288
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,060
all right that's it from me I'll hand

289
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,859
over to the ram session

290
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,639
sorry

291
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,740

I would like to uh just a quick question

294
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,839
uh like uh I don't know if my slides are

295
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,300
were added to the slide deck that you

296
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,339
have there or whether I should share

297
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,380
this screen using my own slides

298
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,860
the slightly sheltered where all we we

299
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,320
got so can you maybe share your own

300
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,420
screen okay all right

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,839
um hi everybody so I would just like to

302
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,720
take this opportunity

303

335
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,400
my screen is not big enough for me to

336
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,580
see

337
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,140
just said that we will mail the plaque

338
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,220
to him uh okay in China yeah

339
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,860
unfortunately on my computer screen I

340
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,260
could not is is a bit hard to see the

341
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,400
whole

342
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,080
yeah sorry about that yeah no problem so

343
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,000
we're trying to figure out if that was

344
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,520
possible or not anyway

345
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,460
um in addition to the scientific program

346
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,000
of course uh for such a conference to be

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,080
successful we need a General chairs that

348
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,679
are capable of putting up

349
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,360
the the whole infrastructure setting up

350
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,360
the whole infrastructure so that the

351
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,059
uh it so that the conference can take

352
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,000
place and I'm very thankful for both

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,980
program chairs so first

354
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,700
I would like to thank uh

355
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,780

the recognition of uh his contribution

357
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,840
today is here in the field of cryptology

358
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,460
research through the role of General

359
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,020
chair of Asia Crypt 2022.

360

the virtual conference Administration

384
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,700
which is uh it makes it possible for us

385
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,400

Asia Crypt 2022 start the ROM session

404
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,460
pick this cross no boring presentations

405
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,780
today we show you something new

406
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,720
it's up to you yeah

407
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,980
yeah age group 2022 hey hey Asia Crypt

408
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,340
20 22. hey yeah that's not too bad okay

409
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,780
let's just keep moving with the program

410
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,700
so Matias up to you

411
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,140
welcome again I'll I'll continue without

412
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,820
wrapping otherwise everyone's gone very

413
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,659
quickly

414
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,760
we have put together a program for

415
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,799
tonight we got much more submissions

416
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,720
than we expected so I hope you will

417
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,799
enjoy it

418
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,679
we have a little special thing here in

419
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,820
the bottom you might have already seen

420
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,340
it and for those of you who have been at

421
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,980
chess in Atlanta it's 19 you might be a

422
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,720
little familiar with this already but

423
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,960
it's even better now so if you

424
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,900
go to this website

425
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,880
you will find a forum where you can

426
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,200
enter a message

427
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,659
that's similar to as chests in Atlanta

428
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,120
and we'll show up in the bottom here

429
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,159
seems to work

430
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
but there's also the button below that

431
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,080
that says next slide and if enough

432
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,299
people press this button then it will go

433
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,820
to the next slide

434
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,980
so maybe we can try that now and some

435
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,900
people there's a counter there in the

436
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
bottom you can press the next slide

437
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,559
button and then it should go to the next

438
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,918
slide

439
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,860
uh the website is the link is here in

440
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,100
the top

441
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,200
that works nice

442
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,500
so now we just need to fill you

443
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
okay there is also process we have ports

444
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,179
on pineapple cakes you too quick

445
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,400
uh we bought some pineapple cakes so the

446
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,620
two best talks are going to get some

447
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,900
more pineapple cakes

448
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,840
um and now we go ahead so you'll see

449
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,080
that

450
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,919
this is lagging a little bit it's not

451
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,679
you will see the title showing up and

452
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,360
it's also says we will be afterwards so

453
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,980
please get ready and come to the stage

454
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,080
so I would like to ask the first

455
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,178
speaker to come to the stage

456
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,740
okay let me go back to the website once

457
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,980
more and then we get started this one

458
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,080
going back it's not a good idea

459
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,720
yes

460
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,980
okay now you got it and we can start

461
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,919
good evening my name is Yonder Kim at

462
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,880
Kingman University in South Korea it is

463
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,179
a great pleasure to be here the topic of

464
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,220
my presentation is style Channel

465
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,840
analysis of the remaining

466
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,059
vulnerabilities for Moscow daily

467
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,720
software library or sensors a globalized

468
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,860
security company

469
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,460
census is publishing the a software

470
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,120
library on the architop the publish it

471
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,059
code is the C code of various encryption

472
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,760
and decryption and the first order

473
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,340
Brewing masking which is a counter

474
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,640
measure against diet Channel analysis

475
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,120
is applied the characteristics of the

476
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,900
code are as follow along the key Ms

477
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,720
subwide spectral masking changing and

478
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,659
these columns are implemented as a

479
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,480
function respectively the input output

480
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,740
of which function is stored in a form of

481
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,100
our two by four two dimensional array a

482
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,919
total six random barriers are used and

483
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
the change of the masking value is shown

484
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,179
in the figure below

485
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,100
however the code has a vanilla ability

486
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,559
inside Channel analysis even though

487
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,360
bullying marks is applied

488
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
the coupling effect is a physical effect

489
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,400
that deterior lights this small skin

490
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,539
for example when X2 X or M is stored in

491
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,559
memory or register where Exxon xor m is

492
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,200
stored the kitchen occurs for Exon

493
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,940
nexons too

494
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
combine the correlation parallel this is

495
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,840
the size of analysis

496
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,940
using the correlation between the power

497
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,600
consumption and it's a result of the two

498
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,659
intermediate value by using the keys due

499
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,240
to the coupling effect we apply this

500
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,779
analysis or mask the as software library

501
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,799
of sensors

502
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,740
the experimental environment is as

503
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,320
follow we use GPS polite and purple mono

504
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,820
is just

505
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,600
um

506
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,000
or extra to come to a combination of two

507
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,080
bytes

508
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,820
always works output

509
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,580
the following is the result of first

510
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,059
order combined correlation paralysis

511
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,840
we set the extra value of zeros force

512
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,539
and first Fifth and 11th 15th bytes

513
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,179
always

514
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,760
as the intermediate value Azure result

515
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,220
orbital key were recovered

516
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,220
foreign

517
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,460
vulnerabilities were observed

518
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,799
and among them the case with the

519
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,679
difference of provides was the most

520
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,500
available when counting the number of

521
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,740
vulnerabilities for each function

522
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,679
masking change has the most

523
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,380
vulnerabilities and the highest

524
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,179
correlation coefficient extreme

525
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,240
experimental result showed that masking

526
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,659
needs to be designed to eliminate

527
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,740
please term vulnerabilities as for your

528
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,039
attention

529
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,700
the speaker after already got ready

530
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,200
somewhere in the front so we can switch

531
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,760
a little faster because we have a packed

532
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,620
program

533
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,399
foreign

534
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,860
University again

535
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,480
today's my topic is fourth injection

536
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,299
attack for the neural network parameter

537
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,539
report

538
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,539
Authority injection attack

539
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:45,419
laser electrobiotic or something against

540
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,500
DNN causes bit flips of some parameters

541
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,100
of DNA you'll take this classification

542
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,419
or recover some parameters

543
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,200
in previous work prayer proposed sniff

544
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,419
they can reverse engineer neural

545
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,600
networks with protein injection attack

546
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,360
when the activation function of the last

547
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,220
layer is soft Max and the attack Target

548
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,799
is the last layer of student model that

549
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,918
is person transfer learning like this

550
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,360
he's suggested when assigned bit flip of

551
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,360
one parameter by 14 additional object

552
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
occurs and the article can recover that

553
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,600
bias or rate of DNN which is the object

554
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,419
Target by these two by these two

555
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,620
formulas

556
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,539
uh this is probably not supposed to use

557
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,480
DNA results before and after the first

558
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,799
injection attack

559
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,340
notice there's all and

560
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,179
Oba and in the case of weight recovery

561
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,000
it originally uses the output of the

562
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,600
last hidden layer and it is not it as h

563
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,679
however this paper limitations it is not

564
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,820
considered when multiple bits are

565
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,679
flipped after default injection attack

566
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,620
and it is assumed that the author can

567
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,299
check the position of the flipped bit

568
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,679
so when multiple bits are flipped as the

569
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,260
uh plate or the other girl cannot check

570
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,260
the position the previous formula cannot

571
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,240
be used

572
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
and so we propose generalized formula

573
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
and algorithm to recover the parameters

574
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,419
in other words uh multiple bits can be

575
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,399
occurred and

576
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,500
the other group does not need to know

577
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,159
where the bees are flipped

578
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,179
and this Lambda is a essentially symbol

579
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,700
to our formula it means the ratio of

580
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
parameter values before and after fourth

581
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,460
injection attack for example when the

582
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,600
RSB bit of the exponent of the floating

583
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
Point number is split

584
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,620
from one to zero it can be complete like

585
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,760
this

586
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,299
uh

587
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,580
here the Lambda is two and they can be

588
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,200
pretty complicated

589
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,840
before the attacker recovers The

590
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,500
Apprentice

591
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,080
and finally this is our new formula

592
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,480
using the formula presented in the

593
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,080
previous work instead one of two

594
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,820
we use one minus Lambda

595
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,899
uh to both and others is same

596
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:52,140
although detailed proof was written it

597
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,899
gave similarly to the previous study

598
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,700
so still the attacker can handle the

599
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,240
position of split beat so he also cannot

600
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,520
know the value of Lambda

601
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,580
however the target bias or rate the

602
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,340
buyers array is fixed before the attack

603
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,500
so perform multiple 40 injection attack

604
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,440
stop paying more multiple injection

605
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,919
values for possible lambdas a computer

606
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,919
bias or rate which is at the attack

607
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,059
Target

608
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,200
about using these two formulas and to do

609
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,980
this repulsively if the same values are

610
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,500
out it is our correct parameters

611
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,299
okay

612
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,679
thanks thanks for listening

613
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,140
hey good evening so I analyzed last

614
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,559
year's program to infer what this year's

615
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,020
program would look like but I went for

616
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,259
the Euro Cup version so it was more fun

617
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,119
good so what I it doesn't work

618
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,719
yes what I try to do is I'll put all of

619
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,020
what happens just into some Ai and I let

620
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,639
it do the work because I'm lazy

621
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,099
and yeah what's the worst that could

622
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,280
happen

623
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,000
I think I need to go to the laptop

624
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,580
well

625
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,219
um so we have a talk to just say okay so

626
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,839
I think I can do this today

627
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,500
okay

628
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,020
and the other thing is oh no it's too

629
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
it's good there was a talk called

630
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,280
oysteres which was 20 minutes

631
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
that's a very very long rump session

632
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,780
talk but osterisk is also

633
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,580
a sub of Oslo

634
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,960
and that's a one day journey by foot so

635
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,660
I think for these 20 minutes they

636
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,560
invented the TARDIS

637
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,339
so what else did we have we had sleep

638
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,960
friendly programming which I think is

639
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,420
very very appealing

640
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,720
and I think they're going for an

641
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,880
achievement in the bombers Peak Peak

642
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,300
number two

643
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,359
and then they of course had some crypto

644
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,619
bashing as we always do it's very

645
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,660
popular

646
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,320
and then there is this like we went here

647
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,839
beyond the day Mark so we're in a new

648
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,540
day and these people are still posting

649
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,800
just serious talks don't be these people

650
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,040
foreign

651
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,280
bullshitty name something we need to

652
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,180
know

653
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,040
I think everything is something you need

654
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,940
to know

655
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,720
and then this guy he really dropped it

656
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,680
the spaceborne arm Chinese space policy

657
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,579
security and Eugenics

658
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,099
I had to look him up he's actually a

659
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,060
famous

660
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,920
sports player didn't know he was a

661
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,740
cryptographer as well

662
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,040
and then we also get security through

663
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,339
transparency which is kind of good

664
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,320
and the last thing that the bot

665
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,300
generated for me was cryptocurrency

666
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,780
privacy decentralization harm and I

667
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,460
thought that was the time to call it

668
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,260
quits and now for today's sponsor

669
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,820
oh no

670
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,880
in a second yeah the II didn't want

671
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,099
anymore but today we will get to the

672
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,020
sponsor

673
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,480
we have a very very good sponsor today

674
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,960
it's Satan as a service it is for all

675
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
your good evil deeds and we do have a

676
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,000
white paper because we are very serious

677
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,260
about our crypto research so read it

678
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,800
foreign

679
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,700
well most of all we provide

680
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,680
cryptocurrency privacy decentralization

681
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,399
and harm

682
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,800
and

683
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,420
there's a free trial

684
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,380
you should check it out

685
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,980
no strings attached

686
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,980
and let's get into our white paper for

687
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,460
one second so we have a scheme called

688
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,099
evil and it means existential

689
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,560
vulnerability and identity based luxury

690
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,260
I will explain to you what this notion

691
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,680
means

692
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,859
there is a two-phase protocol first

693
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,359
there is a setup

694
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,460
so basically you have a luxury venue

695
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
which is just a hotel like the region

696
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,320
Taipei

697
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,720
and you have a devil which is me

698
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,000
and so in the setup phase you would

699
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,060
register or make a booking which I

700
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,859
didn't

701
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,619
and then in the online phase what you do

702
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,640
is you could request some beverages

703
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,260
and then

704
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,460
you know

705
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,380
they would actually kind of like try to

706
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,079
find out so are you entitled to have

707
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,300
breakfast here

708
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,000
and then you know they should give it to

709
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,440
you

710
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,720
or they should kick you out

711
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,680
and of course you win

712
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,359
I've heard about raid Shadow Legends

713
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,599
it's a great game and it is a normal not

714
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,830
at all the scam so

715
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,240
[Music]

716
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,740
um

717
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,980
yep so what can we do here what can

718
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,859
satanas do for you

719
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:08,760
well we try to prove that evil is

720
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,520
possible but we do need your help and

721
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
this is the interactive part

722
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,280
we are security researchers so let's

723
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,460
show that the ID protocol is actually a

724
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,619
big failure

725
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,099
