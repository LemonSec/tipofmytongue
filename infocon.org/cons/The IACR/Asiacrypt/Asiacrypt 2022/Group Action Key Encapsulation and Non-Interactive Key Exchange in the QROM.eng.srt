1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
my name is shreyan Duman I'm a PhD

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,140
student at Royal University program and

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,640
in this short video abstract I'm going

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,859
to talk about you on our work on group

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,599
action based key encapsulation and

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,040
non-attactive key exchange in the

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
quantum random molecular model and this

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,759
is a joint work with Dominic Cartman

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,340
Ikea Sabrina kunzuela Jonas

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
so what is a non-attective key exchange

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,939
we have Alice and Bob and they have a

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,160
secret and public keys and they exchange

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,500
their public keys and besides exchanging

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,180
their public key says no interaction and

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,640
they can compute a shared key and if you

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,700
have a key exchange it's G to the a b

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,440
and the different key exchange is

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,260
passively secure uh under the under the

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,420
decisional DVM and assumption which

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,820
states that g to the a given G to the a

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,680
g to the B and G to the a b

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,539
there's a computationally indecentable

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,579
from G to the a g to the b g to the U

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,579
for a b and U uniformly render from set

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,820
P where p is a prime order of the group

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,039
now there's a slight variant of the VM

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,460
and key exchange called HTTP hammer and

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,799
here the shared key G to the a b is

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,180
additionally hashed using hash function

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,439
h

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,439
also here we include the public keys

32
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,299
and interestingly this is actually

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,640
actively secure under the strong CDH

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
assumption and the render molecular

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,700
model and what does a strong CDH

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,439
essential state

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
it states that it's difficult to compute

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,460
G to the a b given G to the A and G to

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
the B and additional access to an oracle

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,619
the social Oracle which

41
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,979
decides about G to the G1 exponentiated

42
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,479
by a equals G2

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
so in the quantum world we don't have

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,100
the VM and key exchange anymore at least

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
not the classical one

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,460
because discrete logarithms are

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,500
efficiently computable by large quantum

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,579
computers

49
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,439
and for lattices and codes it's an open

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
research question to build efficient

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,619
making

52
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,360
but from misogyny-based cryptography

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,100
like Seaside we have a candidate for

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,780
Quantum assistant Nike

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,140
and in our work we take the more

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,960
abstract view of group actions of the

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,520
group action framework

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,399
and what is a group action

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,879
it's a group G and set X together with a

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,599
map

61
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,220
and the map apps from G and X to X and

62
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,980
we have some additional conditions which

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm going to talk about more in the full

64
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,520
version of The Talk

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
so in our title we said we studied in

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
the quantum random work model so what's

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
the random Quantum random molecular

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,280
model

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,900
well if you want to study the quantum

70
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,459
resistance or scheme Sentry and the

71
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,720
render Markle model

72
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,300
then we have to assume

73
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,340
actually access to to Quantum access to

74
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,379
the hash function because a quantum

75
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,860
computer can compute the hash function

76
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,180
locally and then

77
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,580
do superposition queries

78
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,019
so

79
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,060
this is actually then the right model to

80
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,739
study a Quantum resistance or schemes

81
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,780
and the the right extension of the

82
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,560
random molecule model

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,540
so now let us talk what we do in our

84
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,660
work so we have the group action based

85
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,260
uh HD family key exchange here

86
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,120
and what we do is we prove that the

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
active security of the scheme and the

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
qram

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
using the cloud group action Quantum

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,940
strong CDH assumption

91
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,680
and

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
show that such an assumption is

93
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,519
necessary

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,379
and we show how to weaken the Assumption

95
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,500
by alternative constructions for example

96
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,480
using training or key confirmation and

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,860
we prove also the corresponding cap

98
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,540
secure

99
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,500
so this is the last slide of this short

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,300
video abstract I look forward to see at

101
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,379
the full version of The Talk
