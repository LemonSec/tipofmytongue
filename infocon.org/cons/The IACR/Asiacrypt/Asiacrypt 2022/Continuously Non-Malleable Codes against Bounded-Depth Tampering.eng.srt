00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,940
hello everybody my name is Elena

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,160
michaeli and today I am going to present

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,319
continuously normal level codes against

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,900
boundary depth tampering this is a joint

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,540
work with jalucabrian Sebastian Faust

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,639
and Daniel 11 tool

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,039
so let's start by introducing what

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,560
normal labor codes are a normal level

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,840
code is a coding scheme which means that

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,119
it's a couple of algorithms in code and

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,119
decode that are public and keyless the

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,800
first property that we require is called

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
correctness which means that for every

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,000
message when we encode it to get a

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,399
codeword C and then we decode C we

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,380
should get the original message

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,780
the second property is called abnormal

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,960
ability there we require that if an

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,300
attacker chooses a tampering function f

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,180
from the predefined set F and then is

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,860
allowed to observe

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,140
the message corresponding to the

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,860
evaluation of f over the codeword C then

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,960
the stamped method should be either

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,780
equal to the original one or independent

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,480
of it or tampering should be detected

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,640
meaning that the decoding algorithm

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
should return a special symbol both

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,080
of course we would like to prove

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
abnormal ability for families as large

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,600
as possible unfortunately this was

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
proven to be impossible and in

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,580
particular it's impossible to have a

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,119
normal level code against arbitrary

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,759
probabilistic polynomial time functions

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,259
therefore it's interesting to understand

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,659
for which families one can have normal

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,380
ability and under which assumptions

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,840
a natural generalization of normal level

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
codes is given by continuous normal

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,759
labor codes in this case the attacker is

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,740
allowed to specify a polynomial amount

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,259
of tampering functions and observe the

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,659
resulting messages this selection can be

45
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,659
done adaptively based on the outcome of

46
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,119
the former tampering attempts and here

47
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,740
we will assume that the experiment

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,140
performs a self-destruction mechanism

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,659
meaning that as soon as tampering is

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,060
detected once then all the following

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,280
tampering attempts will be answered with

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,239
both independently on the actual outcome

53
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,400
when considering continuous normal

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
ability we have two variants the first

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,920
one instead of non-persistent tampering

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,560
here every tampering function is always

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,260
applied to the original codeword

58
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
the second one is that of continuous

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,239
persistent tampering here instead each

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,220
tampering function is applied to the

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,400
outcome of the former tampering attempt

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,739
we're referring to the classic notion of

63
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,260
normal ability we will often use the

64
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
term one-time normal ability and it's

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
not hard to prove that in general this

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,900
does not imply continuous normal ability

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,599
this Gap is even more evident when one

68
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,220
looks at the state of the art of

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,019
abnormal level codes

70
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,080
recently research has focused a lot on

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,660
the case of granular Tempe where each

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,840
tampering function divides the codor in

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,480
predefined blocks and tampers with each

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,879
of these blocks independently

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,860
in this case a lot of interesting

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,560
one-time constructions are available and

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,599
many of them were already extended to

78
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,459
The Continuous setting

79
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,220
when one moves to the more General case

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,680
of global tampering a lot of interesting

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
constructions are available in the

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
one-time scenario

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,459
on the other hand when one considers

84
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,980
continuous normal ability not many of

85
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,800
these constructions were extended

86
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,680
our work aims to close this Gap by

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,420
investigating the possibility of

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,700
continuous normal labor codes for large

89
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,519
Global tampering families such as local

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,819
functions ac0 functions and bounded that

91
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,920
functions

92
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,280
in particular our first contribution is

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,760
an impossibility result for continuous

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,860
non-persistent normal codes against a

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,540
large amount of global tampering

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,780
families this includes ac0 local

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,480
functions even with very small locality

98
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,900
and Boundary depth functions therefore

99
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,599
we move to the persistent setting and

100
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,340
there we provide the first construction

101
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,099
of a continuous persistent normal labor

102
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,279
code against decision tree dumpling

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,260
why decision tree tampering because

104
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,418
decision trees generalize local

105
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,860
functions

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,040
as for parameters we get locality o of n

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,620
to the power of 1 over 8 where n is the

108
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,720
codeword blanked and as for the

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
assumptions we assume only the existence

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,460
of one-way functions

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,460
next we also provide a construction for

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,680
bounded depth damping

113
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,040
this proof is in the CRS model and the

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
main building blocks are time lock

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,699
puzzles and simulation extractable

116
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,400
succinct zero knowledge proofs

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,979
this is the end of my talk I thank the

118
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,120
audience for the attention
