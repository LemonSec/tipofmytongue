00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,179
hello everyone

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,520
this is the video abstract for

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,220
multi-user security of the sum of

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,980
truncated random permutations

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,679
I am what's up and I will present the

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,960
full version of the slides on December

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,500
7th

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,840
here is a brief motivation for our

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,340
research

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,859
peroxide projects are one of the most

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,380
common cryptographic Primitives

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,279
for example AES is used in wireless

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,660
security

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,219
processor security file encryption sscl

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,140
TLS protocol and more

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,920
a block Cycle takes fixed ranked inputs

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,399
so if you want to encrypt more than MB

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,160
data you must repeatedly apply the

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,578
blockchain

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,219
many blocks diaper based constructions

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,920
were proposed to handle arbitrary length

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,059
messages

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,720
for example there is a counter mode for

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,659
a mode of operation and this is used in

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,040
the sharing

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,360
however

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,220
such reverse constructions only

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,840
guaranteed was rebound security

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
this issue can be addressed by building

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,820
slow and down functions from slowing

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,000
down permutations since book Cyprus can

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,020
be regarded as to random permutations

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,920
in this study we propose new Beyond

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,619
birthday bounds sugar periods in the

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,060
ability user security model

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,900
here are the constructions left sat1 and

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,400
s82

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,979
boost constructions are accelerating of

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,240
two translated outputs from permutations

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,340
sat1 uses a single permutation with

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,700
domain separation let's say T2 uses two

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,020
independent commutations

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,619
we also studied the sum of truncated

44
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,340
sorry sum of three random permutations

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,800
sop31 is a single permutation button and

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,080
was studied by bhattacharya and nandi

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
and Russia Crypt last year

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,140
however they didn't study sop3 too and

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,599
we showed that sophie32 can be more

50
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,319
secure than slp31

51
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,680
here is the comparison table for our

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
research and Sophie Street one

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,660
m is the output bit

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,500
mu is the number of users and qmx is the

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
maximum number of queries for each user

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,580
the security band of sop3 and SCT are

57
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,739
both meaningful when the number of users

58
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,180
is huge

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,120
while we can invest the efficiency of

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,879
Sat by truncating a smaller number of

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,459
bits when the number of results is small

62
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,000
or low script level is a load

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,760
in other words it is possible to take a

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
trade-off between the number of users

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,140
secret level and efficiency

66
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,800
fold the application sat can replace key

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,040
generation algorithms especially GCM

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,879
sibui she told you she plus an associate

69
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,819
music since I take initial values direct

70
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,280
from secure prfs

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
those constructions would perform better

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,620
in the multi-ujusted team when combined

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,800
with sat1 or s82

74
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,780
while probing their overall security

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,940
would be on Independent topic of

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,260
Interest

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
this is the end of the presentation and

78
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,799
thank you for listening
