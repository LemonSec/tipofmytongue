00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,259
hello everyone my name is in this video

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,720
I will briefly introduce our work named

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,820
the stretching Cube attacks improve the

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,800
methods to recover massive superpowers

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,380
cities are joined to work with Kai who

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,859
but perennial animation one

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,500
secular attack was proposed by dinner

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,939
and shamia at eurocrat 2009 any output

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,160
beat our symmetrical Cipher can be

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,500
expressed as a body function of the

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,080
secret variables K and the public of

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,960
rival sex the coefficient of a cubital

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,300
max3u in this body function is called

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,579
the super poly whose value can be

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,379
calculated according to a Mobius

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,780
transform in the online phase of the

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,879
cube attack the attacker can fix the

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,219
non-cupid rivals to constants and

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,500
recover the exact expression of the

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,200
super poly saying in the NFS he can

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,300
calculate the value of the super poly

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,120
and the establishing equation for K some

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,399
information of K can be extracted by

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,120
solving the equation

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,799
in the early stage of the Cuba attack

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,140
only linear or quadratic super police

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,720
are targeted later thanks to the

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,640
introduction of the division property

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,460
and the MRP modeling method even complex

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,080
super police can be recovered

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,659
practically the division property can

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,939
also be Revisited from an algebraic

33
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,220
perspective leading to the so-called

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,619
monomial prediction technique at the

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,619
asiacraft 2021 who ate or purpose the

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,780
framework called Nasty the monomial

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,180
predictions by combining the divider and

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,280
concrete strategy with the monomial

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,799
prediction technique our work is a

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,240
natural follow-up to their work

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,759
for composite Boolean function setting X

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,579
to Y the monomial prediction or division

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,460
property allows to predict if x2u

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,759
appears in the F or Y to V by counting

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,860
the number of so-called monomial or

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,399
division shows for a cube term x2u if we

47
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,860
can determine all possible gkx to U

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,020
contained by F we can determine the

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,158
super poly accordingly

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,258
from a perspective of structure the

51
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,959
nested monomial predictions consists of

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,060
two components which we call the

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,340
coefficient solver and the term expander

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,040
the coefficient of solver is responsible

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,260
for computing the super policy for each

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,020
term winning a time limit while the term

57
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,420
expander is responsible for expanding

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,080
also the terms into terms of a different

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
these two parts are run iteratively

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,799
until no answer determines the remain

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,200
we experimentally found that the

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,599
efficiency of the whole framework is

63
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,940
mainly determined by the efficiency of

64
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,760
the coefficient solver the MP chooses

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
the monomial prediction as its

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,660
coefficient of solvent but counting the

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,120
number of monomial trails at once were

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,280
becoming practical as the number of

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,239
rounds grows

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,580
therefore we redesigned a two-stage

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,280
coefficient solver where the first stage

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
is considered the most time consuming

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,500
part the remaining problem is how to

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,360
model the two stages

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,239
so the monomial prediction can also be

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,599
used to characterize the first stage

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,940
further analysis showed that it has a

78
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,360
problem of over Precision this inspires

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,760
us to sacrifice some accuracy for

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,159
efficiency leading to a new technique

81
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,920
called core monomial prediction by

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,099
combining CMP with MP we can derive a

83
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,619
singular MLP model for the first stage

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,959
if the new MRP model greatly speeds up

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,720
the super poly recovery as a result we

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,760
not only verified the previous results

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,580
at a much lower time cost but also

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,500
recover the new superpolias for more

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,180
rounds of several stream servers

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,420
finally by enhancing the key recovery

91
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
method based on the Mobius transform we

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,099
also show how to extract One beta

93
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,620
information of the qubits from a massive

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,540
super poly containing a broken symmetry

95
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,519
to the 30.5 terms

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,418
