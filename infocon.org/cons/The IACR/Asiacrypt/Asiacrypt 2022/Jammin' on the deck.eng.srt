00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,140
hi I'm Johan diamond and I want to draw

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,359
your attention to our paper jamming on

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,440
the deck

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,540
this is the paper we submitted to Ace

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,940
equipped and it got happily accepted and

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,679
it will be presented by one of our

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,340
co-authors Shield vanish on Wednesday at

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,359
8 50 in the ballroom B in the session on

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,680
semantic crypto it's a joint work with

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,480
all-time collaborator Ronnie wanker of

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,140
the ketchup team set offer to also is in

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,700
our team since a few years and has

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,440
always great ideas

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
uh Bachelor student noga bhagwati who

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,079
was at her boat and did an internship

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,280
and who's

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
uh internship led to this work and last

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,940
but not least Jill varnash who will

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,820
actually present the paper

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,980
okay what is it about it's about

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,680
refactoring

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,719
uh symmetric

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,780
so let's take a look at a metaphor a

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,579
metaphor for the field of symmetric

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,400
crypto is this sea landscape

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,560
so we have two worlds actually and the

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,900
first world is above the water and

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,420
that's a world where everything is nice

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,900
and clean and we the the world base

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,740
itself on ideal Primitives and these ISO

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,240
Primitives they're represented by the

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
water surface so the water surface is

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
nice and smooth and uh if that is the

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,780
case then we can do nice things above

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,479
the water like approval make provable

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,299
the approvably secure schemes

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,820
and these schemes for their provable

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,420
security they base themselves on some

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,860
assumptions on the uh water surface so

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,840
on The Primitives and The Primitives is

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,880
typically a block Cipher it's like

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,460
dominantly the pro at the Block Cipher

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
but under the water there's another

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,659
world and that is the world of Crypt

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,579
analysis of people that try to find

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,500
weaknesses in Block Cycles try to

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,780
specify attacks

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,299
or try to prove properties of block

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,219
cycles and these are two different

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,140
worlds and it's a nice interface and

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,479
this interface has given us a lot of

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,020
nice modes and also nice block size for

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,300
that it kind of divides the world of

54
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,760
symmetric capital in two nice Parts but

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,120
there are some constructions that do not

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,540
fit this nice image and one such

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,260
construction is something I go back to

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,440
my work with the Vincent Ryan so it as

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,180
you know we did together the AES but

60
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,879
later we did some other work and one of

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,860
these other things was Pelican Mac and

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,319
Pelican Mac is a Mac function based on

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,319
AES Randal that only requires four

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
rounds per

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,360
additional block of plain text so

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,340
additional block of message to to Mac

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,500
and so it's about two and a half times

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,379
faster than AES so the problem of this

69
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,060
construction is you get it cannot be

70
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,640
reduced to the security of a as to the

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
PRP security of AES but you have to

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,519
really do Crypt analysis but the uh the

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,680
gain is that you get a much more

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,420
efficient attack function

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,700
another example is the monkey duplex so

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,220
monkey duplex in general the duplex can

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,980
be proven uh

78
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,239
secure if you assume a random

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,099
permutation if you believe that such a

80
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,659
thing exists as a kind of a

81
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,000
controversial issue but monkey duplex is

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
not anymore because you use different

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,200
number of rounds and there's no way you

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
can model this underlying permutation as

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
being ideal

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,280
uh the monkey duplex is cereal

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,700
more parallel function is farfalle so

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,220
it's a construction to build a function

89
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,720
with variable links input and variable

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,080
length output based on a permutation in

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,720
this case symbolized by f

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,879
and it has also several instances

93
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,040
covered and zoof covered based on the

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,340
ketchak F permutation and gachapi

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,040
permutation and zoof based on Zulu are

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
more recent permutation is a bit more

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,480
lightweight and all these things they

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,340
require for their security Crypt

99
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,159
analysis so we thought maybe it's a good

100
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,159
idea to kind of put the Border elsewhere

101
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,358
and put the border at a level where the

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,160
underlying primitive can handle variable

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
length messages and make one function

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,180
like that and build modes on top of that

105
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
and this interface is a deck function so

106
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,960
a deck function

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,660
is something that takes us input a

108
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,900
sequence of strings of all arbitrary

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,880
length and generates an output string

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,880
also of arbitrary length and using this

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,100
deck function we can build very

112
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,259
efficient modes and get these modes can

113
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,040
be proven uh secure but reasonably

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,860
simple proofs

115
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,000
assuming that the underlying deck

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
function is hard to distinguish from a

117
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,479
random molecule and that is actually

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,100
what the paper is about that's also what

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,020
the talk is about I hope we will show up

120
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,539
in large numbers thank you
