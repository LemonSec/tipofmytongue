00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
hi my name is honors and I'm here to

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,799
present the paper encryption to the

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,839
Future on behalf of me and my co-authors

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,720
Mateo and Naruto

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,000
in traditional ABC protocols there's

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,040
often this optimistic assumption that we

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,460
have access to a set of reliable nodes

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,640
that have an underlying Network that can

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,199
be represented by fully connected graph

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,060
in reality the picture looks more like

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,900
this

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,939
we often have these large heterogeneous

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,359
networks where nodes join a leave at any

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,059
point in time and can be subject to DDOS

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,620
attacks but even more adversarial

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,239
strategies with the element of

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,800
blockchains we not only getting digital

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,520
currencies and nfts but we also get this

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,960
incentivized coordination platforms that

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,239
can be used to tame these large Networks

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,100
blockchains are large peer-to-peer

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,079
networks with the built-in consensus

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,600
layer that gives us some interesting

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,579
properties

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,320
one of them is this Lottery mechanism

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,960
that is often used to select the party

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,600
one node who is going to propose the

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
next block in the system another one is

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,880
this total order broadcast

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,619
Channel

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,540
that is used for every node to know

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,700
which messages has been received in

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,220
which order the question we might ask is

34
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
can we repurpose this kind of blockchain

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,540
infrastructure to orchestrate

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,659
some kind of empathy a sequence of Works

37
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,920
studied with kind of blockchain keep a

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,860
secret and going to yoso NPC and liver

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,400
fluid MPC has investigated this and

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,979
answered to some extent yes

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,680
in particular the use of paper we are

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,420
trying to conduct APC in the presence of

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
a mobile adversary

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,360
this imposes some interesting

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,340
requirements on the protocol in

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
particular there has to be some kind of

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,180
limited interaction pattern

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,280
and a node can only speak once because

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,659
otherwise it would be subject to

50
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,159
corruption

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,740
also the adversary cannot know who will

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,540
play an important role

53
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,600
in the protocol in advance so node has

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
to be anonymous until it speaks

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,180
this has some attractive side effects

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,479
for example these protocols allow nodes

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,758
to join and leave also there is some

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,220
scalability benefits so these large

59
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,440
networks allowed for sampling smaller

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,300
committees that have the right

61
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,000
distribution with high probability

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,540
so we can conduct NPC using committees

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,879
that are sub-linear in the size of the

64
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,840
whole network

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
so in the use of paper they distinguish

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
between World execution and role

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,400
assignment

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,500
rural execution is basically just

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,480
selecting machines and having them

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,540
execute the protocol as specified role

71
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,239
assignment is the exercise of actually

72
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,879
associating a machine on the network

73
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,340
with a role in the protocol but also

74
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,140
establishing this receiver Anonymous

75
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,060
channel to the machine

76
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
notice that we don't want to rely on

77
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,300
full witness encryption because that

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
requires heavy cryptographic tools

79
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,580
and also we don't want to use timelock

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,319
puzzles because that would allow an

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,780
adversary that puts in enough resources

82
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,959
to also obtain whatever message is in

83
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,940
the receiver Anonymous Channel

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,040
in fact our work can be seen as a

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,140
generalization of role assignment be

86
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,120
motivated by the exercise of

87
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,860
transferring secret state to Future

88
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,319
commences first of all we consider both

89
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
Anonymous and transparent Community

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
selection

91
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,080
we also see what difference it makes to

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,900
encrypt through the near future as

93
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,060
opposed to the far future

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
and we look and investigate the need for

95
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,200
auxiliary communities when carrying the

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
state into the future

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,340
arming contributions in the paper can be

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,319
listed as follows but then question to

99
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,879
the near future we show that we can

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
instantiate yoso using our encryption to

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
the near future and an anonymous lottery

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,500
we also introduced a relaxed version of

103
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,299
Windows encryption that we call weakness

104
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,640
encryption or commitments

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,980
we use this witness encryption all

106
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,980
commitments to construct an encryption

107
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,299
to the Future

108
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,239
we also show that we can obtain Fitness

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
encryption or commitments using just

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,220
oblivious transfer and capital circuits

111
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,019
if you look at equation to the far

112
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,379
future then if you don't allow ourselves

113
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,159
to use auxiliary communities then we'd

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,599
have something that is equivalent to

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,459
blockchain witness encryption

116
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,199
this is a primitive that is quite

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,478
powerful and we describe it further in

118
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,520
the paper

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,340
however if we do allow ourselves to use

120
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,080
auxiliary currencies

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
then we can

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,979
have a construction using encryption to

123
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,020
the near future which is significantly

124
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,199
easier to construct and threshold

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,419
identity based encryption this gives us

126
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,639
a construction which is has minimal use

127
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,620
of auxiliary currencies

128
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,139
basically the communities only has to

129
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,259
carry the state which is a master secret

130
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,820
key of the I database encryption scheme

131
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,199
this makes the state independent of the

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,139
size and the number of messages and is a

133
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,560
big Improvement compared to other works

134
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,660
at this piqued your interest then check

135
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,360
out our paper a d print and come watch

136
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,460
the presentation at Asia Crypt

137
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,820
see you
