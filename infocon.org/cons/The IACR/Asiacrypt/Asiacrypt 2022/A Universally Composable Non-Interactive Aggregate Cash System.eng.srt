00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,840
hello everyone I'm yeshu Zhang from

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,240
University I'm glad to present our work

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,058
a University campus board

4
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,440
non-interactive aggregate Cash System

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,820
this is a joint work with chiffonson

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,920
[Music]

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,619
in Bitcoin an attacker can anonymize

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,680
transactions by clustering and analyzing

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,560
transaction graph

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
to prevent the transaction graph from

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
being reviewed there is an approach

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
called drug conjoin to break the

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,620
linkability the core idea of coin

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
drawing is to aggregate the transaction

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,600
in the same time period in each

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
aggregated transaction for each output

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,500
coin others cannot know which input coin

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,440
is a source therefore the transaction

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,239
graph cannot be recovered

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,280
bimbo wimble is a solution that uses

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,920
coin joint to break linkability besides

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,140
coin drawing mimo rainbow also uses

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,120
skillers and commitment to achieve

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,880
amount confidentiality more specifically

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,220
in Bingo limbo the center and the

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,380
receiver interact to generate a

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,840
transaction and send the transaction to

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,119
the aggregation layer then these

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,840
transactions will be aggregated into a

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,939
big aggregate transaction

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,520
and the aggregate transaction will be

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,619
submitted to The Ledger

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,040
mimo mimbo also has a beautiful feature

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,540
called cut through

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,080
this means that if this coin is find by

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,960
this coin then the two coins in the

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,780
aggregate transaction will be cut and

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,659
the storage course on chain will be

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,020
saved

40
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,600
memory has a drawback that impacts the

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,960
usage of mimbo wimble in practice the

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,479
center under the receiver must interact

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,060
to generate a transaction which means

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,159
that the two parties have to be online

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,399
at the same time this is because that in

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
each transaction a signature under the

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,340
excise e is needed however each party

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,640
holds a part of the signing key

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,819
so the two party needs to interact to

50
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,260
generate the signature

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,959
in our work we aim to avoid the drawback

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,260
of mimbo wimble mimo wimble was objected

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,200
to an aggregate care system we designed

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,800
an aggregate aggregate Cash System that

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,560
that can support non-interactive

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,739
payments so we call it non-interactive

57
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,340
aggregate case system and iscs for short

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,980
they are metformalized an ideal

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,480
functionality

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,280
for an isas finally we prove that our

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,980
scheme can securely realize the ideal

62
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,140
functionality under the universal

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,958
composition framework in a hybrid model

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,319
we find that in the window rainbow the

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,560
signature under e has two functions the

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,780
first is to prove that the transaction

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,900
is balanced and the second is to prove

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,540
that the sender knows the spanning keys

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,000
of the input coins

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
in our work

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,620
we separate the two functions by adding

72
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,780
the notion of address to achieve

73
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,459
non-interaction

74
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,640
we also use the signature under e to

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,159
prove that the transaction is balanced

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,640
but we use the signature and the end

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
address to prove that the sender knows

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,299
the binding key of the input coin

79
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,299
given the initial idea of ID objects to

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,580
achieve non-interaction there are still

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,280
some challenges first how to bind a

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,340
commitment and an address second how to

83
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,739
bind the proof of the ownership of input

84
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,180
coins with the transaction Third how to

85
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,500
non-interactively transfer the private

86
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,080
information of the output coins to the

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,140
receiver finally how to maintain the

88
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,940
important feature cut through

89
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,920
but also Define the ideal functionality

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,339
for an isds unlike the original Ledger

91
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,120
the idle functionality for an Isis

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,520
submits the aggregate transaction Into

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,919
The Ledger now the individual

94
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,919
transactions for transaction The Parting

95
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,560
node involved in each can only obtain

96
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,680
the coin identifications which Hinds the

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,880
coil values and relevant parties

98
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,699
please see our talk at issues crypto

99
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,180
2022 for more details of our work I'm

100
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,100
looking forward to see you at that time

101
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,880
thank you
