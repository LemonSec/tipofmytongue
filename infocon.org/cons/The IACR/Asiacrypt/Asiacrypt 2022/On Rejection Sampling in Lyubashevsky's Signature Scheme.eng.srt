1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,280
in this short skit I'm going to describe

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,619
ludashinsky's signature as well as all

3
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,859
the issues with alcohol during our work

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:23,279
using this Target and a plastic gun

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,859
Calvin is a very skilled shooter he

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,760
never misses the mark

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,420
he is on the lookout for a new challenge

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,559
we'll use him to represent the signer

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,719
they asked Julia who represents the

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,360
secret key to hold and randomly move a

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
vein in front of the target for him

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,540
as he doesn't know where the target is

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,539
Calvin will randomly shoot darts towards

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,079
the Veil

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,299

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,579
when he eventually manages to hit the

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,039
target he goes to mashid's office to

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,760
brag about it

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,040
the goal being that mashit should not be

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,100
able to extract any information on the

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,670
state of the veil or the state of Julia

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,420

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,520
thanks to Calvin's skills that's not the

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,700
case my is very impressed by the

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,159
performance and is unable to learn

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,680
anything else

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,900
Kelvin likes challenges

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,060
and has no thinking about the same

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,939
questions we pondered in our work

30
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,040
to make his performance even more

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
impressive

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,780
he would like to shrink the target

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,240
however he doesn't want to miss too

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,299
often it takes too long to recover dots

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,560
on the ground

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,840
maybe if it changes the target to

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,240
something else for instance

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,119
the Target and Veil are square he could

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,119
get an even smaller radius what about if

40
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,280
we use gushans

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
and actually

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,360
could he change his weapon for something

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,598
else that would be more accurate

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
find out a formal definition of those

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
questions as well as their answers

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
either on eprints are directly at our

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,610
conference talk thanks for watching
