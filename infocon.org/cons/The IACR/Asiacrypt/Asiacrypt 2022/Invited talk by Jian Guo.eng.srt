00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,460
to the first invited Talk of the

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,340
conference the talk will be by Gian guo

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,100
on evolution of cryptanalysis security

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,760
updates on shatri and AES hashing about

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,519
our speaker Gian guo is currently a

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,160
and continuously provides updated

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,620
security evaluations to important

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,780
symmetric key designs such as shattu

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,460
shatri and AES

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,759
symmetric e cryptography in 2011. let's

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,840
all welcome our speaker

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,840
thanks for the introduction and thanks

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,640
for the invitation

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,020
it's my honor to present uh talk here

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,619
so today I will present a topic on

37
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,320
evolution of group analysis security

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,798
updates on shastri and say Yes hashing

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,780
so I have to acknowledge all my

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,119
collaborators on these two topics uh

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
they are my ex PhD supervisors

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,020
colleagues

43
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,119
[Music]

44
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,500
poster

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,660
students and Friends

46
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,840
so today I will try to give the talk in

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,700
five parts first I will give the

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,640
introduction on hash function and clip

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,020
analysis

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,720
then I will move to developments of

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,580
copper analysis

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,640
followed by the security status of AES

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,819
and AES hashing then I will summarize

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,580
so first of all I will I have to

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,920
emphasize that the talk is educational

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,599
so uh

57
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,080
so I tend to give the talk to General

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,900
audience including people outside of the

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,580
symmetric key fields

60
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,340
so you will not contain too much

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,959
technical details but to cover the most

62
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,720
updated security status

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,720
on the fields

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
so starting with the definition of a

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,300
harsh function hash function is a

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
function mapping a b string of arbitrary

67
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,239
runs to a fixed lens digest so usually

68
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,620
we use H to denote the function and N to

69
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,440
denote the size of Digest

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,940
that core security has to offer

71
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,680
Collision resistance premature

72
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,739
resistance and second primage resistance

73
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,500
Collision resistance refers to the

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,440
property that it should be

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,140
computationally difficult to find two

76
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,140
different message such that the digests

77
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,159
are the same

78
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,379
so the key here is that there's no

79
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,540
restriction on the selection of either

80
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,799
message

81
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,739
the attacker there are people who want

82
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,739
to analyze it has the full degree of

83
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,879
freedom to choose x and x Prime

84
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,000
the second security is premature

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,140
resistance

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,720
so given the target key it is

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,540
computationally difficult to find a

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,799
message X such that the digest of X is T

89
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,519
and second primage resistance is very

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,940
related to premature resistance

91
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,180
rather than the digest the attacker is

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,860
given a message

93
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,040
and that goal is to find another message

94
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,240
such that the digests are the same

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,199
it has many significant applications so

96
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,960
um for example digital signature we can

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,259
use the hash and sign approach to

98
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,139
generate the signature password storage

99
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,380
usually comes with a sort together with

100
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,759
the password before the hashing

101
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,139
checksum so this is used quite often for

102
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,199
large buyer downloading so to ensure you

103
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,780
have a correct fire download that's

104
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,419
usually what we do is uh to check the

105
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,540
checksum against the one provided if

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,060
they are consistent then it's very

107
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,460
likely that

108
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,160
the file is correctly downloaded and

109
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,400
message authentication codes

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,639
in the way of hashing of a key and

111
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,880
message such as hmac and Mac

112
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,979
so shashri was triggered by the

113
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,979
triggered by the Broken of xiaowang in

114
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,639
2005 by a Chinese researcher sharing

115
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,440
Wang and her team

116
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,780
then nice to organize the discharge

117
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,280
competition in 2008 or October 64

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,039
submission received

119
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,600
2009 July 14 selected for Round 2

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,660
2010 December 5 selected for round three

121
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,479
and

122
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,180
2012 October ketchup was announced as a

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,080
winner

124
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,080
beside a group of people from Belgium

125
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,419
actually here is here

126
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,259
uh it's three years later the ketchak

127
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,240
was formally standardized as jashree

128
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,479
it has four major digest sizes two to

129
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
four two five six three eight four and

130
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,380
five one two

131
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,860
and later on two extendable digest sizes

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,100
are added they are named sha Shake one

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,860
two eight and

134
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,259
it has a very different design strategy

135
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,560
from xiaowan and shot two

136
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,720
consists of 24 rounds and the diner also

137
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,319
proposed a kangaroo 12 with 12 rounds I

138
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,020
will come back to this later

139
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,380
so another major instance of a hashing

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,560
is what we call AES hashing so AES

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,979
fashion is a hash function designed from

142
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,120
AES

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
that because AES was so widely used it

144
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,319
will cause a marginal additional cost

145
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
to implement a hash function if the AES

146
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
itself is already implemented

147
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,220
so uh about AES so it was the successor

148
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,819
of BS

149
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,979
and there was there was the attack by

150
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,099
mass reason so I think it's also here

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,199
I saw him yesterday at least

152
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,960
uh so niece they organized that this AES

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,900
competition in 2019 uh 1998 June 15

154
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,660
submission received at the next year

155
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,039
August 5 selected for round two

156
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,979
thousand topper Rhino was announced the

157
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,400
wind designed by Zhong and Vincent and

158
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,759
the year after it was formerly

159
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,919
standardized the AES supports three

160
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,900
different Keys one two eight one nine

161
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,460
two and two five six

162
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,220
yeah uses the white chess strategy to

163
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,020
resist differential group analysis

164
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,479
because differential group analysis and

165
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,300
linear group analysis what a major group

166
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,879
analysis technique invented

167
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,840
before aesmt was the major threat to Des

168
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,279
and the number of rounds are 10 12 14

169
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
respectively for the three different

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
variants of keys it can be converted to

171
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
Hash function by modes such as Davis

172
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,839
Mayer so this is one example so if we

173
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,320
use the message as the key and hash the

174
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,180
previous training Value Plus the key

175
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,000
again we'll get the updated training and

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,740
this will be the compression function

177
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,839
so

178
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
as we know group analysis is the major

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,140
uh energy consuming I mean human power

180
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,700
consuming parts

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
in the hawk

182
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,860
symmetrically design cycle

183
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,880
it will take lots of time uh

184
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,420
and actually lots of design parameters

185
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,360
depends on the group analysis results

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,820
so now it serves as two to trade off

187
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,580
between the Simplicity efficiency and

188
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,080
security for designs to run numbers okay

189
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,920
so meaning that if usually the design is

190
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,040
iterative with this similar wrong

191
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,220
function repeated several times

192
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,459
when we have more rounds it means we

193
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,060
have a larger security margin but uh

194
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,040
lower efficiency if we have lesser

195
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,779
rounds we will have higher efficiency

196
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,320
but lesser security margin so Cooper

197
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,660
analysis methods is trying to make the

198
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,300
best trade-off between the security and

199
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,279
the efficiency so that we get an

200
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,180
efficient one yet not broken yeah

201
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,279
the major group analysis method

202
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,380
developed in the past two decades

203
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,300
includes differential group analysis

204
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,080
linear code analysis integral analysis

205
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,240
and meets in the middle attacks for more

206
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
attacks Cube attack Etc

207
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,540
so take differential crop analysis as an

208
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,720
example The major portion of

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,880
differential group analysis is to

210
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,720
find a good differential path

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,680
good means high probability yeah and

212
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,959
evolved from

213
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,560
hence

214
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,220
finding differential paths by hands and

215
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,160
people believe that the broken of Shawan

216
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,300
was actually done by hand in 2005.

217
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,019
and after that the people will write a

218
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,940
dedicated program to search for

219
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,820
differential passes according to their

220
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,079
experiences

221
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,440
like for lower number of rounds what are

222
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,019
the good good ones and try to propagate

223
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,800
to a larger number of rounds

224
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,459
starting from 2011 people started to

225
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,320
utilize set like servers

226
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,660
from 2019

227
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,120
machine learning also found its

228
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,000
application in trip analysis so the

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,300
problem is that so we are given inputs

230
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,640
out output differences and the number of

231
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,399
rounds we want to attack

232
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
then people have to find the

233
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
intermediate differences so that the

234
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,560
overall differential

235
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,600
probability is high or Optimum

236
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,560
so the approaches are before we have all

237
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,019
the tools is mainly about human

238
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,600
experiences

239
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
to narrow down that such space so for

240
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,079
example we know for low number of rounds

241
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,360
two or three we know how to do it by

242
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,200
hand

243
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,720
and if we have to build

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,820
larger number of Brands differential

245
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,920
parts we repeat them or we build try to

246
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,000
add additional rounds on top of the

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,620
shorter differential passes yeah

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
we also have the meet in the middle

249
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,820
approach meaning that if we have two

250
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,579
shorter differential passes we try to

251
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,240
connect them by matching the inputs and

252
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,660
the outputs of the past two passes yeah

253
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,720
so that's what we have done for many

254
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,959
many years so people we find useful

255
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,040
tools like set and machine learning

256
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,000
so in 2011

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,060
set like servers were introduced to

258
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,240
Cooper analysis one of the issue is that

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,220
it's difficult to predict the serving

260
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,079
time meaning that uh

261
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,839
the only thing we can do now is to try

262
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,980
and see whether it give us the results

263
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,940
if it doesn't

264
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,480
we don't know whether

265
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,860
is not solvable

266
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,800
in real time or the model has itself has

267
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,420
some problem yeah

268
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,880
so either yes or no

269
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,820
machine learning is similarly so we're

270
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,459
constrained by the Practical from

271
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,639
complexity meaning that once we have the

272
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,399
model fixed

273
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,899
uh

274
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:51,180
we have to we have to train the model in

275
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,500
Practical time

276
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,959
if that model cannot be done in

277
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
Practical time we cannot be sure whether

278
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,740
the model is working or not yeah so uh

279
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,160
yes both have this uh

280
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,519
function of practical complexity

281
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,800
so for a set like servers it's hard to

282
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,399
achieve optimality for any uh so it's

283
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,500
it's hard to achieve optimality for any

284
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,959
equip analysis attacks which are usually

285
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,260
tunable by virus parameters so sort like

286
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,019
set like servers are here to help for

287
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,660
better optimization here I list a simple

288
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,360
example so if we have a list of

289
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,060
constraints

290
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,639
um with inequalities

291
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,100
and we Define an objective function

292
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,920
either we want to minimize something or

293
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,260
meaning maximize something

294
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,320
so this is a very a simple example of

295
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,820
milp

296
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,060
we can directly input this into this MIB

297
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,260
server

298
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,220
and you'll be able to Output us the

299
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Optimum or sub optimal solution so in

300
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,440
this case it's one two and the objective

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,639
is three which is maximum yeah

302
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,600
so for group analysis we can actually

303
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,639
convert all the constraints into

304
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,639
inequalities like this and fit into the

305
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
server once the server give us some

306
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,519
solution then it means a solution to

307
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,160
that group analysis results yeah

308
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,620
so for example the differential path

309
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,500
search the constraints are simply we

310
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,779
have to make sure that differences

311
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,120
intermediate differences are compatible

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
in each round

313
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,579
so they they they form a complete and

314
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,920
compatible differential path and the

315
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,699
optimal goal is the overall probability

316
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:47,699
which is dependent on the choices of the

317
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,859
intermediate differences okay

318
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,139
who is uh okay with content computer in

319
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,500
light we also consider the group

320
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,220
analysis

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,519
under condenser thing there are two

322
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,980
major algorithms available which are

323
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,680
different from the classical ones so the

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,199
Growers Grover algorithm which is also

325
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,839
called the quantum search algorithm

326
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,959
it takes the square roots and time

327
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,220
versus n in the classical computer to do

328
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,699
the boot for search yeah so that's the

329
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,220
immediate impact of this is that the

330
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,339
security strengths of rock cybers is

331
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,240
half

332
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,540
so 128 bit key becomes insufficient

333
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,259
because uh 2 to the 64 is very close to

334
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,600
a practical time

335
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,060
and second premature and premature

336
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,920
resistance of hash function is also

337
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,019
halved yeah because of this book for

338
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:52,980
search

339
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,500
another algorithm useful for us is the

340
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,779
assignments algorithm so if the function

341
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,820
f is periodic

342
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,779
means that FX is FX plus b for all X in

343
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,179
the domain so it costs polynomial time

344
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,040
to find that period P yeah

345
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,859
so the immediate application of the

346
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,339
global algorithm is is application to

347
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,679
content Collision finding so

348
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,660
traditionally content attack in

349
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,540
classical setting it will cost per stay

350
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,359
time which is square roots of the search

351
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,040
space yeah

352
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,540
and this can be done simply by selecting

353
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,820
to the above the N different values and

354
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,340
store the digest in the hash table

355
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,840
and

356
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,620
roughly with a probability about half we

357
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,340
will be able to find the repeated Digest

358
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,980
we do the same for Content setting

359
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,500
except that that's now we only need to

360
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,940
store 2 to the N over 3 because now the

361
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,320
search is uh done by Grover which can be

362
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,380
done in square roots of the such space

363
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,240
so if you have 2 to the anniversary

364
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
values available in the space and the

365
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,660
entire space is 2 to the end and the

366
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,400
ratio will be due to the two n over

367
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,760
three and the time to do a search in

368
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,520
this ratio is simply two to another two

369
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,120
and over three yeah so the overall time

370
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,059
complexity for Collision finding in

371
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,000
content setting is 2 to the anniversary

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
uh so means that if the digest size is

373
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,840
120 a bit it only offers two to the 42.7

374
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,220
security

375
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,679
which is insufficient yeah

376
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,620
another impact on differential based

377
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,220
Collision attack is that uh

378
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,120
at the lowest useful probability

379
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,240
uh changes from 2 to the N over 2 from

380
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,360
the classical setting to to the negative

381
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,740
2N over 3 in the content setting because

382
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,220
with this probability we only need to do

383
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,260
the search in time to do the anniversary

384
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,740
in order to find one colliding pair

385
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,200
so in content setting there are

386
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,960
potentially much larger such space

387
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,780
and uh

388
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,400
also potentially result in longer

389
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,600
attacked rounds yeah

390
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,179
so with all this in mind meaning that

391
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,900
the developments of the group analysis

392
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,140
method from the traditional ones to the

393
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,640
server added ones and in the setting of

394
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,320
a classical and

395
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Quantum will look at the security of a

396
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,080
shot three and AES hashing

397
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,820
social 3 was

398
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,700
following the sponge Construction

399
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,740
the design is simple so the internal

400
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,980
internal function is a permutation as

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,220
and it starts with the initial value so

402
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,660
top Parts R Beats is Chord rate at each

403
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,140
registration are bits of message is

404
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,260
added to the states at the beginning

405
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,820
and this was fit into the permutation f

406
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,059
and this was repeated until all the

407
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,160
message bits was processed

408
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,039
then it goes to the squeezing phase

409
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,740
which outputs a bit at the issue

410
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,860
iteration and here you get sufficient

411
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,620
many bits needed

412
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,919
so shashri there are four major

413
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,520
four major instances

414
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,860
but they share the same permutation as

415
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,660
meaning that's uh

416
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,600
uh the only difference between the four

417
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,740
instances are the parameters R and C

418
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,340
okay

419
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,700
it can be organized in in in a cube uh

420
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,900
five times five times 64 cubed uh it has

421
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,179
24 rounds each round consists of five

422
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,840
steps and out of the five there are only

423
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,240
one non-linear operation

424
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,080
first step is called Sita which adds the

425
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,659
parity of two columns into the current

426
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,100
bits

427
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,600
so there was the notation of a column

428
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,659
parity kernel means that if all the

429
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,840
parity of the columns are zero then this

430
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,240
forms in the CB kernel and he has some

431
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,780
special property because in this case

432
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,539
Theta becomes the identity yeah means

433
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,260
you

434
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,220
who does nothing

435
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,860
and we have the role which is the lane

436
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,100
level rotation so we have a five by five

437
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,659
25 rows and each row rotates by a a

438
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,200
defense value of offset by according to

439
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
speech table

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,059
find step is the permutation of the lens

441
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,240
according to this formula so you need

442
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,280
that we just Shuffle the position of the

443
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,179
lanes

444
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,179
and Kai is the only non-linear operation

445
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,880
which is Sim which is a simple circuit

446
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,059
design okay

447
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,120
so uh we have a value here to go through

448
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,299
the navigation and together with the

449
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,140
next value go to the ends operation and

450
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,140
add this value adds pizza so that's the

451
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,260
updates uh the speeds so this applies to

452
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,440
every bit we can see easily see that the

453
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,380
algebraic degree of chi is 2 because

454
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,400
there's only one non-gate and the

455
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,919
inverse that it has algebraic to grade 3

456
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,539
which is a very low compared to AES

457
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,020
Yota is adding a constant round

458
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,299
dependent constant to the states

459
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,760
so this is to destroy the symmetry

460
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,940
so overall we can see that the Yota

461
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,220
destroy the Symmetry and it does nothing

462
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,120
else so in our differential attack we

463
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
can simply ignore this one

464
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,799
the first three are linear operations

465
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,860
and the chi is the non-linear part so we

466
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,419
can actually combine the first three

467
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,059
operations to form a big linear

468
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,559
operation

469
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,280
the overall attack framework is

470
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,220
something look like this

471
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:53,240
so uh there are there are two

472
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,659
foreign

473
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,220
actually tries to connect the

474
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,320
connect the initial value to the the

475
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,960
input difference here so we call it

476
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,340
connector

477
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,760
so the parts we can control is the rates

478
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,179
because the message is added here so we

479
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,360
can choose the correct the message we

480
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,820
wanted so to change the value to what we

481
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,100
want uh really

482
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,760
but this version capacity it speaks to

483
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,700
zero so there's no way for us to change

484
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,299
it so the value is zero that

485
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,299
defense is also zero so uh

486
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,539
there's nothing we can do here so we

487
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,480
only miss we only have the degree of

488
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
freedom of this R Beats try to connect

489
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,980
it to uh

490
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,539
the data in here after a few rounds so

491
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,820
there's a series of developments worked

492
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,059
on this

493
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,059
uh in FSC

494
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:24,900
2013 and the connector was one round and

495
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,500
in Euro Cup 2017 we tried to

496
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,740
uh expand it to two rounds by having a

497
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,220
fully linealized

498
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,039
rounds means that here we will have a

499
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
layer of all Xboxes active and try to

500
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,419
linealize it Legalize It means that we

501
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,799
try to fix a

502
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,980
uh some values of the Xbox so that the

503
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,779
Xbox

504
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,840
becomes a linear operation yeah

505
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,360
and set crypto 2007 17 we extended this

506
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,840
to a partial three round connector means

507
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,919
that uh we cannot fully control all the

508
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,159
all the defenses but part of them we can

509
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,279
do so that we leave some of them to be

510
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,640
probabilistic matching this data as in

511
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,240
and the rest are by the connector yeah

512
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,539
okay so the result was uh

513
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,039
the result was a

514
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,440
at the very beginning only three runs

515
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,659
shot three five one two and four rounds

516
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,900
shot three three a four can be done and

517
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,820
only three round version chapter three

518
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,820
one five one two can be done practically

519
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,960
uh in 2017 we extended this to uh five

520
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
rounds practical attacks on Shake one to

521
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,179
eight and Charles 324

522
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,240
and later in a general version of this

523
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,880
paper of this two paper we also extended

524
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,480
the Practical Xiao 3256 Collision

525
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,480
without to be practical yeah

526
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,960
yeah so that's the original idea without

527
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,700
that set okay

528
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,840
so as we can see here uh we actually

529
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,960
involve three parts of the attack the

530
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,380
first part is to come up with a good

531
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,260
differential pass with high probability

532
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,360
the second part is to come up with the

533
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,059
connector which also offers sufficient

534
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,400
number of solutions for this

535
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,720
differential parts

536
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,240
and the overall goal is to have an

537
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
Optimum complexity so

538
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,240
three parts are done are done

539
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
independently before and they were

540
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,960
searched by dedicated programs and so we

541
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,980
can see each part can be replaced by a

542
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,500
set like solver yeah

543
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,840
so we did that

544
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,799
and combine all these steps together to

545
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,080
achieve Global Optimum

546
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,460
so what we got to uh six rounds attacks

547
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,380
in content and classical setting so uh

548
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,100
weird

549
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,620
present this paper

550
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,440
I think that this is the last talk of

551
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,700
today

552
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,559
on this portion

553
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,580
how this was done

554
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,299
right

555
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,720
so that's about Xiao SRI so on AES

556
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,159
there are 10 12 14 rounds of AES

557
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,960
respectively for three different key

558
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,779
instances and the wrong function looks

559
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,720
like this it consists of four operations

560
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,899
first is the sub byte which replaces

561
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:17,760
each byte by the substitution of s-box

562
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,120
of its value followed by the shift row

563
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,520
so you shift left us cyclically by

564
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,340
zero one two and three positions Mr

565
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,179
column operates on the columns so yeah

566
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:36,539
multiply and MDS Matrix with the column

567
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:39,480
and update it and finally we have the

568
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,260
add key so which is the one key and this

569
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,100
is the key schedule for aes128 okay

570
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,020
so the major Collision attack on AES

571
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,700
hashing is by the rebound attack

572
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,659
it also involved the high probability

573
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,919
differentials yeah

574
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,399
so the idea is that if we have two high

575
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,740
differential uh

576
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,799
high probability differential you can

577
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,020
chop the entire Cipher into three

578
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,159
portion

579
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,620
so uh the first one is what we call fpw

580
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,720
backwards

581
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,820
and the last question is f

582
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,260
FW forward and the middle portion so uh

583
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,520
what we want is that

584
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,120
the probability force in this F the

585
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,299
first and last portion are high so that

586
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,240
when it comes to the boot for search

587
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,600
scattered stage it will cost less time

588
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,279
and we

589
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,159
we want the fbin to connect this two

590
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,740
portion and offer enough number of

591
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,399
candidates for the Brute Force stage

592
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,600
yeah

593
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,360
and this rebound attack was introduced

594
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,820
in FSC 2009 by Mendo at all and that

595
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,299
first application was to uh

596
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:15,779
whiteboard and Lane

597
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,360
a true Lane was removed by this attack

598
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,740
yeah

599
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,500
and he relies on high probability

600
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,179
differentials of these two portions so

601
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,720
you can see that where the set set like

602
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,059
servers come to play

603
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,159
the constraint is simply the middle have

604
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,460
to match in the state and key it in use

605
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,340
through the F in portion

606
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,760
and the overall goal of optimization is

607
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,059
the overall complexity means that

608
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:49,140
uh the overall which is uh which is

609
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,260
highly determined by the probability of

610
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,059
the first and last portion

611
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,059
so the Collision attack on NAS hashing

612
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:04,020
uh in the classical setting uh is

613
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,020
reaching seven rounds with complexity

614
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,279
two to the 56 so in order to for in

615
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,500
order for us to have Collision first of

616
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,620
all we have to satisfy the condition

617
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,000
that the input difference and the output

618
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,120
difference is possible to cancel each

619
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,080
other

620
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,140
yeah so you can see the pattern in data

621
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,600
B and the pattern in Delta C are the

622
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,500
same only only then it will be possible

623
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,419
to generate Collision

624
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,580
and then

625
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,720
the dotted line is what we have for f in

626
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
the middle portion yeah the middle

627
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,580
portion we should be able to solve it by

628
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,100
utilizing the degree of freedom from the

629
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,019
key

630
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,019
and out of that the first two and a half

631
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,919
rounds is the F in yeah so in the real

632
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,679
attack after the inbound phase he

633
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,799
actually propagates backwards in this

634
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,519
way

635
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,919
so the probability we are calculating

636
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,659
here is simply

637
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,260
we have a missed column of four to one

638
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,500
here so here is one to four that's which

639
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,418
probability one so we don't pay anything

640
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:22,080
so it's just here four to one

641
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,879
similarly uh the last round we have this

642
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,080
uh

643
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,659
we have this for free because there's no

644
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,179
more mixed column yeah so the only

645
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,879
probability we have to pay is here and

646
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,659
the price that this and this has to

647
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,480
match yeah so we have three bytes

648
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,820
condition here and four bytes condition

649
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,639
here so in total seven byte con

650
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,639
condition which is a 2 to the 56 yeah

651
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,240
foreign

652
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,960
using the original method because

653
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,440
previously the two steps were done also

654
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,900
independently meaning that

655
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,960
the high probability differential of the

656
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,140
forwards and backwards portion are

657
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,440
searched independently and the matching

658
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,400
was done in the Second Step so although

659
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
each each step you might reach the

660
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,339
optimum but globally you know may not be

661
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:31,339
the optimal yeah so after we actually

662
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,579
consider the two steps in one and put

663
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,060
them into a one server

664
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,339
then be able to give us this uh

665
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,579
this uh new results together with the

666
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,040
chain relation algorithm

667
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,500
and in the content setting as I

668
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,960
mentioned in the content setting for

669
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,200
Collision we can go for the probability

670
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,380
as low as 2 to the 2N over three

671
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,660
uh

672
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,660
we are able to extend this attack to

673
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,700
eight rounds so again in order for us to

674
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,760
have Collision we have to ensure that

675
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,640
the patent which is the

676
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,079
which is uh eight bytes active here and

677
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,200
outputs are the same yeah so they are

678
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,480
possible to cancel each other

679
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,339
and

680
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:30,900
we are able to solve a very big inbound

681
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,960
space which covers five rounds here so

682
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,880
uh

683
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,380
from here to here we cross nothing

684
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,859
because uh it is one to four yeah and

685
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,720
from here to here we cross nothing

686
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,700
because

687
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,420
it is one to four yeah so in the end the

688
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,480
only price we have to pay is this one

689
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,619
matching this one here

690
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,520
and it costs 2 to the 34 in content

691
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,220
setting so we can see uh in content

692
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,759
setting

693
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
in content setting this is a very low

694
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,980
complexity so in if online computer

695
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,820
comes to reality this might be the first

696
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,460
targets we can actually Implement and

697
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,780
carry out the

698
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,880
findings

699
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,780
so overall uh

700
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,839
for AES hashing classically we can reach

701
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,780
seven rounds and in content setting we

702
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,839
can reach eight rounds in total

703
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,180
there are 10 Rounds so the security

704
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,060
margin is uh is becoming small yeah

705
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,540
so in summary in summary a

706
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,420
we've seen some developments of Coupe

707
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,700
analysis method from the transitional

708
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,020
methods

709
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,619
to the ones by dedicated such programs

710
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:03,060
to the ones aided by set like servers

711
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,200
and now starting from 2019 we see group

712
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,079
analysis method aided by Machine

713
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,020
learning so the idea is to mimic the

714
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,560
differential based key recovery attack

715
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,520
by Machine yeah so we first train the

716
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,619
machine to distinguish the reduce the

717
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,660
round to its hyperbility differential

718
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,680
from random ones means that as long as

719
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,900
we know there's a high differential

720
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,180
probability covering the entire portion

721
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,900
of the attacker Cipher

722
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,540
the machine should be able to detect it

723
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,280
yeah by

724
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,740
by calculating or

725
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,380
calculating or

726
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,619
calculating the number of output

727
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,540
differences satisfying this High

728
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,240
differential property High differential

729
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,160
high probability differential yeah

730
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,260
and then to launch the key recovery

731
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,900
attack utilizing such differentials so

732
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,740
uh

733
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,099
these two steps were done by hands

734
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,119
people and now it can be mimicked by

735
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,800
by uh machine yeah the first attempt was

736
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
done by God at crypto 2019

737
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,680
with the application to Simon and the

738
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,700
second attempt was uh by

739
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,099
uh my team I guess you have heard the

740
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,380
talk Yesterday by Jensen

741
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,040
with all the details so it was the first

742
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,400
time achieving a complexity which is a

743
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,180
a better than man-made attacks so

744
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,300
Simon was actually analyzed quite

745
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,720
intensively since the since the proposal

746
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
was made public in 2014

747
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,000
and uh

748
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,300
it was uh actually unexpected that the

749
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,300
machine can actually do better than what

750
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,480
we did because uh we have accumulated

751
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
like Decades of experience on

752
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,780
differential based key recovery attacks

753
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,079
yeah

754
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,339
however okay however the limitation of

755
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,520
machine learning is that it's limited by

756
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,260
practical complexity

757
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,619
meaning that uh when the model gives you

758
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,560
results that means the model is working

759
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,140
and give you results and the result

760
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,339
should be right

761
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,460
if it doesn't give you the results

762
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,640
there will be

763
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,560
two possibility either

764
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,420
the model is wrong

765
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,420
or the model simply takes too long to

766
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,839
Output the results yeah

767
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,660
by other experiences so far

768
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,300
the application of machine learning

769
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,640
based group analysis is capable to apply

770
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,140
to very short block size block ciphers

771
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,680
so Simon has the the major

772
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,460
targets we tried here are 32 bits block

773
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,460
size yeah which is very small once it

774
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,880
scares up to 64 or 128 the model becomes

775
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,520
very very slow and takes too much memory

776
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,400
to to do the training and it won't be

777
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,460
able to Output us the uh results in

778
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,320
Practical time

779
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,619
another difficulty is that there's

780
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,099
currently no theoretical treatments of

781
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,440
this machine learning based coupon

782
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,480
analysis so for human right for

783
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,760
traditional differential group analysis

784
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,520
we can do projection yeah

785
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
so if we can carry out the Practical key

786
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,579
recovery attack based on differential

787
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,720
uh then we can do a projection by adding

788
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,280
up the number of rounds because we know

789
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,740
adding this much of rounds the

790
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,720
differential probability will drop by

791
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,960
this much this is predictable yeah

792
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,960
and the complexity of the final key

793
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,140
recovery will also scale up accordingly

794
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,240
however in machine learning there's no

795
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,820
such thing okay

796
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,900
because we have to ensure we get a

797
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,000
distinguisher before we can do key

798
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,020
recovery and we can only guarantee us to

799
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,380
get a distinguisher by the result the

800
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,680
Practical results so far yeah

801
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,280
when the when the block size get up or

802
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,000
the number of rounds scare up the the

803
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,940
machine is no longer able to distinguish

804
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,720
the the Target and the render Oracle we

805
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,119
are not able to tell whether this is due

806
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,540
to our limited amount of resources or

807
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,240
due to the fact that it becomes

808
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,160
indistinguishable yeah

809
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,819
so uh a practical

810
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,880
so as theoretical model to treat this

811
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,020
machine learning is in Urgent needs so

812
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,460
that we can try to scale up the text to

813
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,099
larger block sizes and larger number of

814
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,520
prongs

815
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,520
in conclusion

816
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,119
so so far Collision attacks of charge 3

817
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,099
is up to six rounds

818
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,319
so there are lots of possibility margin

819
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,160
left

820
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,380
because the structure in total have 24

821
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,380
rounds but we are only attacking 25

822
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,160
percent leaving 75 percent as the

823
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,099
security margin so maybe kangaroo 12 is

824
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,960
a good idea

825
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,640
because uh

826
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,119
it has only 12 rounds means uh it can be

827
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,160
twice as fast as strawberry

828
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,640
and still we have 50 percent security

829
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,540
margin left

830
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,020
for AES we can do up to seven or eight

831
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,780
rounds in classical and content setting

832
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,020
is still usable because we have 20 30

833
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,960
percent security margin but in content

834
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,099
setting it becomes very risky to use uh

835
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,760
AES in hashing modes because

836
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,619
it has 128 bits block size offering

837
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,160
maximum 2 to the anniversary which is 2

838
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,940
to the 40 to the 43 Collision resistance

839
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,180
in in theory yeah but even there's no

840
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,280
attack

841
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,119
I guess

842
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,760
very soon we'll be able to see boot for

843
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,460
such uh on 128 bits solution yeah

844
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,700
so it's not a vital it's not a divisible

845
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,180
so to resist content attacks

846
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,700
people should really think about rock

847
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,700
ciphers with a larger box size

848
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,440
such as 256 yeah

849
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,000
so what to expect from future

850
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,760
developments of group analysis we really

851
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,460
want to have a deeper look at the core

852
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,859
algorithms under the server and machine

853
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:20,940
learning

854
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,980
so uh

855
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,839
so for both as I mentioned for both uh

856
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,359
server based and machine learning based

857
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,079
group analysis the bottleneck is that

858
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,720
we are limited by practical time

859
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,819
practical resources

860
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,500
and

861
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,680
when the model doesn't outputs us

862
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,800
anything we don't know whether it is due

863
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,180
to the model

864
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,760
or due to the fact that it becomes

865
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,380
invisible to attack yeah so uh

866
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,880
we really want to figure out uh

867
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,900
how to project this so that we can scale

868
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,400
up our algorithms and the text to uh

869
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,760
to a larger space yeah and another

870
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,420
reason is to uh having this it is

871
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,359
possible for us to select according to

872
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,579
the performance of the underlying server

873
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:22,380
or machine learning

874
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,500
the best strategy to model the attack

875
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,380
yeah so that's uh you actually reduce

876
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,900
the Practical shopping time yeah

877
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,420
yeah that's my thought thank you

878
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,640
any questions

879
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,579
thank you for that nice talk to the the

880
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,220
Collision search on the hash function

881
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,400
and yes my question is you mentioned

882
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,839
that uh break content I mean that the

883
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,599
classical and the quantum setting what

884
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,880
what's the difference I mean that I

885
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,500
interpret the

886
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,500
that when you search

887
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,900
you will use classical searching over

888
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,700
global search that is the difference

889
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,598
what is difference

890
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,500
yeah

891
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,220
okay that is you're using Global search

892
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,020
so

893
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,900
how do you assume that the complexity of

894
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,540
global search

895
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,060
does critical searching is very simple

896
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,640
right yeah

897
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,579
so how can you estimate the complexity

898
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,380
of global soil yeah so the current

899
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,079
Grover search complexity is assumed to

900
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,560
be the square root of the such space

901
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,420
okay so of course I don't have a Content

902
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,400
computer I cannot enjoy it practically

903
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,819
but that's the everybody

904
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,900
I can understand that this is a

905
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,240
theoretical yeah that's theoretical yeah

906
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,000
okay so another question maybe I can

907
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,540
challenge later this is possible to

908
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,300
Break by Quantum machine learning

909
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,940
Quantum machine learning yes

910
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,859
yes right what

911
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,760
okay so there are two things uh which is

912
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,280
uh constraining us from using machine

913
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,880
learning for coupon analysis one is time

914
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,359
the other is memory I think the most

915
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,900
constraints resources is the memory so

916
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,800
far because to train a very large Rock

917
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,960
Cipher

918
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,099
uh especially with 64 or even 128 bits

919
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,040
block Cyprus the amount of data

920
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,859
increased exponentially

921
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,460
so it becomes impossible for the Machine

922
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,880
model to accommodate so many data in

923
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,260
memory yeah

924
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,079
however for

925
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,599
time I think we can use up a

926
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,780
supercomputer to paralyze all the

927
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,900
computations okay

928
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,740
so

929
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,960
yeah in that sense I think it's

930
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,859
difficult especially uh given that the

931
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,440
quantum memory is much harder to achieve

932
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,859
than classical memory yeah

933
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,400
thank you

934
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,839
any more questions

935
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,180
all right let's thank the speaker again
