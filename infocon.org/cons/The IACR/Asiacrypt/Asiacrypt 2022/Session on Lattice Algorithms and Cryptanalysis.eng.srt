1
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,699
thank you

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,500
good morning

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,080
welcome to the session uh lettuce

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,079
algorithms and quick Technologies

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,559
the first talk is the longest unit

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,260
lattices using explicit stickle variable

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,579
generators to solve a prox ideal SVP by

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,079
Olivia Diana on Royal

9
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,160
and the talk will be given by earlier

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,860
thank you

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,000
for attending

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,920
um so as announced

13
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,740
okay thank you

14
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,020
I'm going to talk about the context of

15
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,500
cartoonizes of ideal svb

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,720
um then I will present the principal of

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,380
uh estimate attacks and in particular

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,299
Twisted PHS

19
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,459
um and I will talk about

20
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,340
um details about our work uh to work

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,160
going towards medium Dimensions

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,540
um so let me go through some definitions

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,360
so formally uh lattice is a description

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,700
group of uh to the end so you have a

25
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,060
nice picture oh I want to be nice uh in

26
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,459
for n equals two and you can have a

27
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,360
basis and bad basis

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,480
good one and the purple one is probably

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,280
a bad one

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,459
um and the shortest sector problem is is

31
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,160
a NPR problem anymore

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
um it's asking you to find the shortest

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Vector of the latches

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,819
and you can relax this by allowing some

35
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,860
approximation Factor

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,879
and ready to be still hard for

37
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,160
polynomial uh

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,459
approximate factor in the dimension

39
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,660
so okay foreign

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,840
additional operation in your lattice and

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,819
you can also multiply lattices between

42
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,319
them and so the question is can we use

43
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,099
this structure to better solve ideal sdp

44
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,620
uh I mean to bits of the shortest Vector

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,980
problem in this uh lattices in this

46
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,780
particular lattices and the answer was

47
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,299
no for a long time

48
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,319
uh but in 2014 there was this consumer

49
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,780
algorithm Computing a number of

50
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,659
theoretic objects in a Quantum

51
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,540
polynomial time like such as as you need

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,340
scratch groups

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,799
um

54
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,900
these problems are classically hard to

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,620
solve so exponentially uh in the in the

56
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,360
discriminant of the field

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,180
and this is induced a long series of

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,760
crypto analysis works and I hope that

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519
that I didn't forget anyone but if I did

60
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
please write to me

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,779
um

62
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,320
so okay I'm going to to give

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,540
a a picture summarizing that kryptonite

64
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,100
this series

65
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,660
um

66
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,759
I'm going to make some shortcuts and I

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,259
will complete this later on the

68
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,139
conclusions with recent advances

69
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,240
um so first in the unstructured case you

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,380
have this corkinzo letter F uh trade-off

71
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,180
uh which is um

72
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,300
telling that if you are

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,580
if you are happy with the exponential

74
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,199
approximation factor in the dimension

75
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
then you can do it in polynomial time

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,699
but if you want a better approximation

77
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,120
factors typically a polynomial one then

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
you will have to to pay for for an

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,919
exponential uh time in the in the

80
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
dimension so this is known as hierarchy

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,040
and we are going to try to beat this

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,540
hierarchy uh for ideological

83
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,800
um okay

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,060
so the first the first of the first

85
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,380
generic

86
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,880
um for all latencies and a wide range of

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,039
uh which was fitting the the north

88
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,680
hierarchy is

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,580
uhw algorithm

90
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,520
so it was in 2017 and the original

91
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
reversion is extending this in uh last

92
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,400
year and this uses a short stickleback

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,139
relations

94
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,620
and it says that if you have a quantum

95
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
computers and polynomial time you can

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,740
probably find the sub exponential

97
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,380
sub exponentially small

98
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,060
vectors realities

99
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,240
because this was the first Bridge

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,630
International's hierarchy

101
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:07,800
[Music]

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,180
um

103
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,860
okay

104
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,979
um later on there was this proposal by

105
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:14,720
um

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,479
which was extending the acoustic PHS

107
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,139
um

108
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,919
this is uh maybe known now as a s unit

109
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,300
attacks so the formalism was the was a

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,479
yeah was even in and it was underlying

111
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
PHS and explicitly used interested PHS

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
and this UF uh this applies to any

113
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,580
fields that I am only giving here the

114
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,800
picture for psychological fields

115
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
um

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,900
but you have to pay for an exponential

117
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,780
pre-computation so this this means that

118
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,819
you can do all differential

119
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,940
precapitation on a fixed field and then

120
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,120
you you will uh for each challenge a

121
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,180
better uh trade-offs and hierarchy even

122
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,979
classically you have this Zone here

123
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,780
which you are beating version of

124
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,780
hierarchy and the polynomial you you

125
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,840
have a

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,419
we were wonderful

127
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,860
and um okay so the question is now how

128
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,500
threatening house is as you need attacks

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,660
in projects so this is a little bit

130
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,680
paradoxical because we have yeah we are

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,819
imagining that we have a quantum

132
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,000
computer and uh we are going to ask okay

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,460
is this uh it is really bad for uh for

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,698
iqrstp problem

135
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,940
we use

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,120
um another encoding of the problem and

137
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,639
this gives a extension results in

138
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,080
practice so I think the main two

139
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,060
experimentals are that are surprising

140
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,220
with first the it seems that the

141
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,560
location lattice is very orthogonal you

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,319
can see it on the on this very

143
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,919
um

144
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,639
official shape of the country norms and

145
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,199
the second one is that the approximation

146
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,960
factor that we obtain here in R1 because

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,979
this is a very low lowest line here and

148
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,319
this is a logarithmic sales scale so

149
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,360
there is a huge difference between the

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,419
top curve and the the

151
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,419
lower curves and it seems to be growing

152
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,339
very slowly in a way that could be

153
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,880
selection

154
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,260
but the problem is the caveat is that

155
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,059
it's um

156
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,399
it's only experiments in the small

157
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,380
Dimension and appearances can be very

158
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,080
misleading in this case

159
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,700
so we need to get a more experimental

160
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,440
observation before we can predict

161
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,140
anything you can see well but the

162
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,600
problem that we have is uh it's really

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
hard to to

164
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,339
compute the objects that we need in the

165
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,080
in the classical world and climbing

166
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,839
degrees is really hard so this is what

167
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,180
we do in the

168
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,180
in our work so we propose in the case of

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,779
psychotomic fields for any conductor

170
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,820
the construction

171
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,920
which is a full-on family of independent

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
test units so I will maybe explain a bit

173
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,180
later what it is

174
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,160
um this is composed of two parts so

175
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
first we we take what we call a real as

176
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,839
units

177
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,680
so you get uh probably half of them

178
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,180
half of your whole group

179
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,000
um and so this is the remaining uh

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
classical hard part but it's in half we

181
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
have the dimensions so so it's going to

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
be easier and we complete that by XP

183
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,720
sticker Burger generators so

184
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,480
yes so we proved that by giving an

185
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,580
effective formula for syntax improving

186
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,440
an effective formula for the index in

187
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,540
the full easily group

188
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,420
then in particular season finite index

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,480
so this proves the wrong property and

190
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,000
for computations uh everything is going

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,480
to explode and go wild so we really need

192
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,640
to use a short basis of the sticker

193
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,100
Burger ideas which will give you a

194
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,980
virgin writer and uh

195
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,800
a few of them

196
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,959
okay these are two applications that we

197
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,080
developed in our paper so the first one

198
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,420
is to remove almost all control steps in

199
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,500
the CDW algorithm so mainly uh we remove

200
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,899
the need for the wonderful relative

201
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,790
phase group

202
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,180
[Music]

203
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,160
um

204
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
yes by using uh realcast calculations

205
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,860
and we will move the this PDW is a

206
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,540
two-stage algorithm and that that's

207
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,820
between these two stage here you have a

208
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,100
quantum

209
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,079
step for solving the principle right

210
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,360
your problem but since we have XP

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,519
generators corresponding to our relation

212
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,480
you can just compute that explicitly

213
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,519
second applications to simulate the

214
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,320
twisted creations algorithm in medium

215
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
Dimensions up to 210 which is a huge

216
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,339
computational back breakthrough and we

217
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,860
are able to confirm the the geometry of

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,740
the location that this is uh is very

219
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,760
particular as was noted in 3C PHS and if

220
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,459
you want some theoretical explanation of

221
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,820
that phenomenon you should go and see um

222
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
go and read the paper by Bernstein and

223
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,000
Langer in 21.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,760
um and this is a graph I'm going to go

225
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
back later on that this require for the

226
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,380
approximation factor that we obtain and

227
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,019
you can see that here you we are going

228
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,660
to to have uh something that looks like

229
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,360
exponential or external shape when you

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,380
reach

231
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,740
um I mean you know

232
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,320
meaningful dimensions

233
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,079
okay so

234
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,120
may I explain a bit the principal

235
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,000
General principle of passionate attacks

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,540
um so you take a challenge at your B

237
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,000
and you are first you always have a

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,260
Quantum polynomial step so it can be

239
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,120
completed by a sub exponential classical

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,680
algorithm

241
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,620
and you decompose B on a factor base s

242
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,899
so it will decompose b as a principle

243
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,320
either ideal part and a product of

244
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,560
primary Vector base and the fact is that

245
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,540
all solutions to this decomposition uh

246
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,579
equal module multiplicative Group which

247
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,279
is called the estimate group

248
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,800
and then the aim is to find a short

249
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,660
course at representative of this uh

250
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,420
and so so the the technique is quite

251
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,540
generic you you you have to use some

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,480
um as logarithmic logarithmic function

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,519
which is uh

254
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,339
from value production system and the

255
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,680
image of this unit group under this

256
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
logarithmic function is called the

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,220
location

258
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,300
and with

259
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,440
um when solving uh close this Vector uh

260
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,019
problem an approximate Vector a closet

261
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,899
Vector problem in this location is like

262
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,300
this you will obtain hopefully a short

263
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,459
process of sensitive and you hope that

264
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,800
this is the short element of your ideal

265
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,279
so you can see that there are some

266
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,160
important parameters to consider here

267
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
so the first one is probably and the

268
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
most important problem is the choice of

269
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,519
the S logarithmic embedding so intrinsic

270
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,459
PHS we use the number theoretic weights

271
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,100
so this this allows you to make a water

272
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,579
choice of um of relations

273
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,160
the second important parameter is the

274
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,260
choice of the factor base so you can

275
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,540
take a very big factor base or a smaller

276
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,060
Factor base intrusive PHS we chose to

277
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,740
maximize the density of the local

278
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,800
estimate lattice

279
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,440
and the last one probably the choice of

280
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,380
your approximate CVP worker

281
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,260
so you depending on what price you are

282
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,940
ready to to put in that uh interested

283
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,420
PHS we chose to use a somewhat naive

284
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,700
algorithm we just use a randomized

285
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,139
bye-bye in your plane and in this

286
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,720
presentation we are also using uh

287
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,940
randomized by newspaper for our

288
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,480
experiments

289
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,320
okay graphically this looks something

290
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,300
like that you have the location it like

291
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,519
this here this is a sniper plane

292
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,940
orthogonal to the old one vector uh

293
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,579
let's take challenge ideal B the quantum

294
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,620
decomposition how to put you can see

295
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,600
that you have

296
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,779
uh principal ideal Parts here and a

297
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,399
product of primary Challenger Vector

298
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,180
base and you use your favorite

299
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,800
logarithmic as embedding to obtain the

300
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,279
point the log of alpha 0 here

301
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,139
and now you want to find the shortest

302
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,360
question quantitative

303
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and so all solutions are on this line so

304
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
this blue line

305
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,279
um so this is just a translation by some

306
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,860
point from the location it's like this

307
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,579
and we hope to find the the

308
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,100
shortest one so we'll project the

309
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,899
segregation strategies

310
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,360
um finder as units such that the

311
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,880
logarithmic is embedding of s units is

312
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,740
close to the

313
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,779
to the projection

314
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:37,800
so this will give you here uh SQL

315
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,660
product of some prime minister Vector

316
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,440
base

317
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,880
and then you can subtract this log s to

318
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,920
the log of alpha Z1 this correspond to

319
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,060
Alpha 0 over s in the in the image free

320
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,800
image space

321
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
and you hope that this is a short

322
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
element in the ideal

323
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,220
so the other part is is now to know how

324
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,320
efficient this is the CR part is really

325
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,839
uh the main obstruction is to compute

326
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,120
this location it like this here

327
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
so

328
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,839
in our work as I said we have this

329
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,600
construction which is using a real base

330
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,500
unit

331
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
so you get

332
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,040
um roughly half of them and we have to

333
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,880
complete that with that family by uh

334
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,740
generators and this is really how we

335
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,160
break the ID barrier to get to Dimension

336
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,019
through Android

337
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,560
and the proof is the is about proving

338
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,680
this theorem

339
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,380
the syntax of the

340
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,380
of this of this construction the fullest

341
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,459
unit group and this is not important

342
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,920
exactly the What is the formula

343
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,860
but we have to note that there is a huge

344
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,139
Factor here this is a relative group

345
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,779
with a huge Prime in it

346
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,000
um so this is really big and you have a

347
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,419
huge part here of powers of two and we

348
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,699
can manage to remove them

349
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,400
um so we will use what's called a

350
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,760
classically uh two saturation techniques

351
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,699
and it's consists in detecting the in

352
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,760
your multiplicative family uh some

353
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,280
combinations

354
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,859
and once you have detected squares you

355
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,540
can

356
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,720
you can

357
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,120
you can you can compute square root and

358
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,000
interest it into in your

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,580
new family and everything is going to

360
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,740
good while though so you have to use

361
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,900
short sticklebacker bases to unlock High

362
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,260
dimensions in practice so I I think I

363
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,480
don't have the time to to present you as

364
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,280
a sticker but the ideal you should just

365
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,580
note that you can represent this as a

366
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,880
vector on rational

367
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
and you are keeping the linear

368
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,140
combination of these vectors that have

369
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,720
integer coefficients here

370
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,059
um the second point to remember is the

371
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,640
secret breaker Tom tells you that this

372
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,679
elements uh give free relations in the

373
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,299
class groups we tell quantity they are

374
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,360
ideological sticker backer elements and

375
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,900
uh you are resulting ideal is principle

376
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,419
and the third very important point to

377
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,700
remember is that the proof is completely

378
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,340
explicit so you can describe and compute

379
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,820
the generator but even with moderately

380
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,360
High coefficients we will have a huge

381
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,100
generator so you have to to start as low

382
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,900
as possible so yeah this is a work with

383
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,120
radan Couture and we we showed how to

384
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,539
extract the short bases and we showed

385
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,080
that the in that case the generators are

386
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,660
really easy to compute so experimentally

387
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,130
we

388
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,380
[Music]

389
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,900
yes we were able to you can see an

390
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,960
example here uh for location classes of

391
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,539
Dimension 1200

392
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,100
um this is a j plus the gram switch

393
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,720
lockdown so this shows that this is

394
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
really orthogonal and this is a very

395
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,179
general phenomenon so this confirms that

396
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,799
there is something going on with this

397
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,299
like this

398
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,840
um and second we have this graph of

399
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,039
approximation factors

400
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,840
approximation of this unit is the yellow

401
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,299
points here and you can see that the

402
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,340
system not

403
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,179
for this instance this doesn't show a

404
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,460
catastrophic impact of the of the of

405
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,740
this unit attack

406
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,360
um but this is these are reassuring

407
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,400
because you you yeah you couldn't

408
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,380
densify further your lattice or use

409
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,960
other arguments and uh you will be on

410
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,740
this this curve another point to to see

411
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,380
on this graph is that there were a lower

412
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,520
Bound for the two-stage algorithm CDW

413
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,760
and this is the Green Dots here and you

414
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,799
can see that in some case the the

415
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,679
Twisted pH has simulation here is

416
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,919
beating this um this lower bound

417
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,640
so this shows the power of using a

418
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,179
unique lattice to to optimize the output

419
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,740
or at once

420
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,640
so yes it's down to to conclude so I

421
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,860
would like to to mention

422
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,200
um the recent conjecture by bermstein

423
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,840
eisenhager uh Rubin silverberg and van

424
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
gundendal so this is a wet star here so

425
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,039
if I I um if I try to to give the two

426
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,140
main ideas of this conjecture is to use

427
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,419
a sub-exponential factor basis so very

428
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,480
big factor basis uh regardless of the

429
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
density of your location it like this

430
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,240
and to use an enumeration based closest

431
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
Vector problem Oracle using many

432
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,400
smallest units and to claim is that

433
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,260
you can reach a polynomial approximation

434
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,320
factor in sub exponential time so this

435
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,380
is under this has given rise to many

436
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,780
debates in the in the community there is

437
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,520
no formal paper but you have some code

438
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,940
and description online and maybe the

439
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,980
main issues that experimental evidence

440
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,460
of are limited to to Prime conductor

441
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,940
psychotomic fields of 23 less than 42 so

442
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,120
this might be this might be subject to

443
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,179
the same small Dimension effect and

444
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,600
twisted PHS so this gives yeah this

445
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,220
leads me to my conclusion

446
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,820
on ongoing work so the first item is to

447
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,520
try to intensify further the locations

448
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,380
to verify the evolution of the

449
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,179
operational structure approximation

450
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,440
factor for several orbits and um we we

451
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,299
are almost there so I think in one month

452
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,000
or two we we should be able to publish

453
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,539
uh what we obtained for saturating all

454
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,940
factors of the of the relative class

455
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,980
number

456
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,200
um and the second is to build a

457
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,419
practical simulator of exchange attacks

458
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,200
in order to test

459
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,960
other parameters and to try to explain

460
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,900
better what is going on and the fact is

461
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,419
that this paper that I'm presenting

462
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,980
today

463
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,020
um provided a lot of of data in uh in

464
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,140
medium dimensions and we should now we

465
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,539
we have to use that to support and find

466
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,080
finer heuristics and estimation so thank

467
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,299
you for your attention and if you have

468
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,980
questions to reach for me

469
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,559
we have time for one quick question

470
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,240
yes

471
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,000
so I think many people may be wondering

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
this but so do this type of attack is

473
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,340
there any hope to extend them to say

474
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,720
module at least around two

475
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,799
so for now there is no uh reasonable

476
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,880
proposal to to extend this to modules

477
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,720
unfortunately

478
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,780
okay

479
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,059
so let's thank the speaker again

480
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,900
okay so the the next talk is on model

481
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,299
unique SVP and then true

482
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,760
by Joel federov

483
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,000
Harris today and the talk will be given

484
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,539
by Joel

485
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,159
hello everyone I think my uh

486
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,740
my remote is not working I'm sorry

487
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,380
thank you very much

488
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,039
okay hello everyone and thank you for

489
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,919
fighting the jet lag and tiones to come

490
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,360
and see me at the beginning of the day

491
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,919
so I'm Joel I'm future students

492
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,059
and I'm going to present you a joint

493
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,720
work with uh so Alice polymeri and uh my

494
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,400
supervisor which his name is EP of Frank

495
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
2 and Andrew

496
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,080
so this is actually a good

497
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,059
a good sequence of presentation because

498
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,640
uh at the end of the last one we asked

499
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,400
about modularities and so one of the

500
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,919
goal of transition is to show some gap

501
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,039
between ideal svb and the module recipe

502
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,220
in rank 2. which basically answer the

503
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,220
the previous question so that's good uh

504
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,580
first let me uh let me present the

505
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,440
conservation I'm going to to explain in

506
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,520
this solution

507
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,120
so I'm going here so here a module SVP

508
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,100
of Franklin is just a pedantic way of

509
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,740
saying igrs

510
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,860
I'm going to uh to present uh some some

511
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,500
lattice problems some modulated column

512
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,539
that is equivalent that we showed are

513
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,900
equivalent to enter which is a Security

514
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,299
Essential news in some uh in some

515
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,600
cryptographic schemes and I'm going to

516
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,299
we are going to show that I lost my

517
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,419
pointer that this this new problem well

518
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,760
this problem has a good property which

519
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,500
is a reduction from work's case to

520
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,760
average case

521
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,539
so first some definitions so Andrew was

522
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:24,000
uh proposed in 96 by off-time pipe Piper

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,020
and Silverman

524
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,679
and so here we are going to work on

525
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,980
and predominals so every every element

526
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,840
of every latches I'm going to present

527
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,020
are polynomials modulo x to the N plus

528
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,919
one

529
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
for any power of 2 the size of an

530
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,779
element is the L2 numbers binomial and

531
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,299
and true asks if I give you some

532
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,100
perineal h

533
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,679
which is equal to F over G for some

534
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,059
small f and g

535
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,380
to find back f and g

536
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,840
so this column has been a proposal said

537
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,100
in the 90s it has a advantage over other

538
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,140
cryptographic assumption because it

539
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,360
leads to very small keys so basically in

540
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,940
that problem the public key will be h

541
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,419
the secret key will be f and g and so

542
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,840
FNG are rather small uh it leads to fast

543
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,299
encryption and decryption algorithm and

544
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,580
it's quite old so it has been studied a

545
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,200
lot for example we know we know

546
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,320
basically what modulus cue to take in

547
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,760
order to be secured and stuff like that

548
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,279
well actually we know what model rescue

549
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,520
not to take to not be insecure

550
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,880
so this problem seems a bit a bit adult

551
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,120
like we I give you polynomials which I

552
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,240
call to uh

553
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,760
of a modular Etc so

554
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,100
the question is uh can we relate this to

555
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,020
lattice based cryptography the fact is

556
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,480
yes if you want to analyze this problem

557
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,120
you can define a module which is

558
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
basically

559
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,799
the set of if I give you H is a set of

560
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,799
all possible secret key so the set of

561
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,559
every f and g subjects F times H is

562
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,980
equal to G mod Q this is a polynomial

563
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,600
lattice so let's suppose elements are

564
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
all pairs of polynomials a Frank two

565
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
because there are pairs of polynomials

566
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,539
we call that a module A ranked module

567
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:19,559
and it's generated by the basis 1H 0q so

568
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,960
I take a current based Uh current based

569
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,240
element a current based vectors so this

570
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,720
lattice has a good property which is it

571
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,080
has a very small element in it

572
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,380
so if you look at uh if you look at

573
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,440
lattices if you take a random lattice

574
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
you expect all the short Vector to be

575
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,679
about the same size

576
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,100
well in Android and in the what we

577
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,820
Define as a module unique SVP of rank 2.

578
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,120
you have one very short Vector in One

579
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,380
Direction like one very very dense

580
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,200
submodule and we have

581
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,840
another one so we get those non-typical

582
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,779
shapes of modules so

583
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,580
uh this is this leads us to three more

584
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,159
systematically those those lattices

585
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,559
those modules

586
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,539
uh well

587
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,820
um this is not uh coming up from nowhere

588
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,700
because lattices like that with one shot

589
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,820
vectors and uh another normal I've been

590
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,700
seated before so that's the unique SVP

591
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,539
problem

592
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,580
and it is known to be equivalent to

593
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,460
Bonded distance decoding and sivp at

594
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,779
least quantumly

595
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,240
and so that for instructional lattice

596
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,100
like Z lattice

597
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,039
for air modules so for polynomial

598
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,059
lattices

599
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,600
well this is this this was not suited to

600
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,520
uh to a knowledge before

601
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,919
so we know that Andrew and modular

602
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,440
unique sap of Rank 2 are

603
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,159
easier that modular sapb

604
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,880
other I'm sorry then wait

605
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,279
I'm sorry so we know that it is

606
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,419
AVP because there are instances of this

607
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,799
one we know since 2021 since 2021 by

608
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,100
pretty pretty American city that entry

609
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,760
is easier than modular SVP in rank one

610
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,000
and that's about it we don't know if all

611
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,140
those columns in the middle are

612
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,419
equivalents will be before that we

613
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,480
didn't know we don't know if modulus as

614
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,000
if your Franklin is equivalent to enter

615
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,700
so that's what I'm going to present you

616
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,820
today so uh first I will present a

617
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,700
narrow from this one to this one a

618
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,100
reduction from modulus vpfrank two two

619
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,120
and two

620
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,039
showing that those two columns are

621
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,380
equivalents and then I will show you

622
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,659
that the worst case of modulus pure Rank

623
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,880
2 is equivalent to the average case

624
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,960
okay so so first emergency is equal to

625
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,899
N2 so our reduction works as follows I I

626
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,820
give you uh some instances of

627
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,520
modularization Frank 2 and I want to

628
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,919
transform it into some end to instance

629
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,559
in order to make an improve a solver

630
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,799
running and uh to to solve my uh to

631
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,679
solve my beginning instance so first

632
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,840
that's a bit of a technical detail but

633
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,419
for reduction to work so I we are given

634
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,600
the basis of module usbp f92 instance

635
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,240
which is a basically a two by two Matrix

636
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,700
with a polynomial uh with polynomial

637
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
entry and I want the super enormous

638
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,279
to be praying to be co-prime

639
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,919
so uh

640
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,899
in order to do that what we're going to

641
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,600
do is just to sample some small Epsilon

642
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,240
and to multiply our basis by

643
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,940
the identity plus Epsilon maybe we'll

644
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,179
add a symmetric Factor but basically if

645
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,580
we do that we are going to change our

646
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,960
basis

647
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,380
and with high probability well priority

648
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,600
that is a if you want to get into the

649
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,360
details uh approximately one of the

650
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,520
decay of two for case number field we're

651
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,700
studying uh

652
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,200
this is going to make those two

653
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,500
co-primes okay so now I can I can

654
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,779
suppose eventually I will try again to

655
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,520
try again that's easy to test is also

656
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,480
equipment

657
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,539
uh eventually when zarco primes I can

658
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,039
get to the

659
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,820
to the amid normal form so yeah yeah

660
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,220
quite classical thing to compute for

661
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,360
basis

662
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,340
it works for polynomials it works for

663
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,039
every uh so the skin of the skin of

664
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,260
things so we are going to take the

665
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,539
accident equation algorithm in order to

666
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,179
put a one here by current operation so

667
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,419
there exists a a and b such that ab11

668
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,460
plus

669
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,260
bb12 is equal to one so I make my

670
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,960
columns the column separation

671
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,159
and I put one here okay so now I take a

672
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,279
current operation to get rid of one is

673
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,220
of B12 uh in the current here and I get

674
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,940
this new basis okay this is pretty

675
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,460
similar to the entry Matrix we had

676
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,120
before right one h0q the only big

677
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,179
difference between the two is that b

678
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,580
here is a polynomial but 0 x 16 plus 1

679
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,960
and Q here is an integer so we want to

680
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,299
transform this basis into some enter

681
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,159
Matrix

682
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,519
okay well uh the way we do this is a bit

683
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,200
uh brutal so we take you well we managed

684
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,380
to have B is approximately equal to q

685
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,620
and we multiply by Q over B

686
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,419
uh all the bottom line

687
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,220
so

688
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,320
when we do and then we then we round

689
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,419
when we do that if q and B are

690
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,279
approximately the same it doesn't change

691
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,360
a lot the shape of the underlying module

692
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,080
and we even have an explicit an explicit

693
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,080
formula for the short Vector so now

694
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,320
we've got some uh some intro instance so

695
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,379
H will be the rounding of a times Q over

696
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,659
B Q will be the modulus

697
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,780
and if we find a short Vector of this in

698
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,000
in this set for instance well we've got

699
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,159
a short Vector into the operation sense

700
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,300
we want

701
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,320
okay we just transformed

702
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,899
this basis this this modules which is

703
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,940
the same as the beginning module in two

704
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,219
and interest cells we can solve it

705
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,679
and we want we solve the we solve the

706
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,480
module with the plane

707
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,179
okay so that's that's good

708
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,659
uh uh now I have my reduction

709
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,320
but imagery 2 is not just a module

710
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,119
problem equivalent to entry it also has

711
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,820
good properties so uh in cryptography we

712
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,399
like to have to have Security based on

713
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,440
what worst case assumption so for

714
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,599
example when we sample a quiche the

715
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,160
difficulty of breaking a scheme will be

716
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,320
the difficulty of breaking a random

717
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,560
instance of uh of a problem

718
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
so what we want to do is to say Okay I

719
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,920
want to prove that there is a

720
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,420
distribution in which I can sample the

721
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,300
key which is as difficult as the worst

722
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,460
time or as the worst case instance so

723
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,500
how do we do that well we are going to

724
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,240
make a worthless to average case the

725
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,180
reduction I take some worst case basis

726
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,400
for modularies if you're going to I'm

727
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,160
going to shuffle it enough to make it

728
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,339
random well random meaning independent

729
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,980
of the entry as input

730
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,680
and once it is independent from the

731
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,520
input then I can D shuffle and I can run

732
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,859
my Oracle and then this Shuffle the

733
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,060
solution

734
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,280
in order to have back here the worst

735
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,740
case the the worst case solution

736
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,079
so that's what I'm going to present now

737
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,200
so first let's see the anatomy of uh

738
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,119
module with the pure Frank 2 instance so

739
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,220
there's a cure factorization let's say

740
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,940
that I have the best basis for my uh

741
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,079
for my uh modulus two instance so I can

742
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,700
make the Cure factorization of this one

743
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,040
and it will look like that one shot

744
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,920
Vector here V1 and one very long Vector

745
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,099
B2 and I can reduce B2 by B1 in order to

746
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,020
make this

747
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,220
yeah I went to Define modulo l11 so I

748
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,880
have four variables Q which is rotation

749
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,900
l11 F22 which are the basically the the

750
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,079
length of the of our two vectors

751
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,140
and l12 which is a

752
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,780
the angle between the two

753
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,000
so the goal for the organization is to

754
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,780
randomize qr11 F2 and l12 the thing is

755
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,359
we don't have access to these basis here

756
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,760
right because if we did well the problem

757
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
will be solved so first so I'm going to

758
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,180
try it and randomize everything without

759
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,740
the knowledge

760
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,040
without access to it

761
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,359
so first randomization of R11 and F2 how

762
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,280
do I randomize everyone and F2 basically

763
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,740
I want to multiply them by random primes

764
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,660
so first I can multiply my whole module

765
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,020
by a random Prime and okay so L1 and F2

766
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,300
are going to be random and I'm happy but

767
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,640
the thing is there they will not be a

768
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,359
random in the randomly they would not be

769
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,820
randomized independently so for example

770
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,520
if I multiply all my module by P well

771
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,180
R11 divided by R22 will always be equal

772
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,180
to the same thing so I want to multiply

773
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,839
l11 and not have to two this is going to

774
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,160
be done by specification so

775
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,859
specification is something that has

776
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,300
already been used in lattice based

777
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,760
cryptography and in redictions for

778
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,740
example in the context of cep addictions

779
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,099
so the idea is to say I take a prime and

780
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,300
I'm going to choose a tournament

781
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,380
Direction and to keep only one point out

782
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,619
of this Prime so if my Prime is P I am

783
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,660
going to take one point out of P

784
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,339
and um

785
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,380
and discard the others so this is shown

786
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,980
in this uh in this image so I have this

787
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,540
blue light yes and I only keep the red

788
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,500
dots

789
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,740
so we can prove that doing so you don't

790
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,960
change F22 that much with high

791
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,359
probability but you are going to have

792
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,460
l11 which is the shortest Vector of your

793
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,200
specified lattice is going to be

794
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,660
multiplied by this Prime that you choose

795
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
so

796
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,160
you want you uh you multiplied error one

797
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,780
n not R22 so that's cool now we still

798
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,140
have uh R12 so this uh this angle this

799
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,560
uh this thing to uh to optimize and the

800
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,660
idea is the following we are going to

801
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,460
sample some gaussian some gaussian

802
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,480
Matrix

803
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,180
and to multiply in the left by it so

804
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,520
geometry geometrically what does it mean

805
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,380
it means that every point of the lattice

806
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,500
is going to be shuffled a bit uh not too

807
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,339
far in in some Direction so basically

808
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,579
this is shown in this in this picture

809
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,800
this point is going to be moved a bit uh

810
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,359
you can you can do that mathematically

811
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,859
complete everything

812
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,740
Etc so what we do basically is we add

813
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,020
some gaussian noise into

814
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,520
l12

815
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,920
but l12 as I said before is defined

816
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,440
modulo l11

817
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
so since L1 is a very short Vector which

818
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,900
was our assumption with unique sdb right

819
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,000
uh well just adding a little gaussian

820
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
noise is going to be like uniform is

821
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,740
going to make it not far statistically

822
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,280
from uniform so by adding some some

823
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,500
small noise we make I want to uniform

824
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,520
and we even randomize the

825
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,740
the

826
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,740
the rotation Matrix since multiplying by

827
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,339
a rotation Matrix is uh and then wait on

828
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,260
the other side uh multiplying by

829
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,260
regression and rotation Matrix is the

830
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,359
same as multiplied by equation and

831
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,320
that's all

832
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,020
so here we won we randomize everyone

833
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,260
when I R22 in the previous slide here we

834
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,960
just randomized Air 1 2 and Q in this

835
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,359
slide so we want to get the worst case

836
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,760
to average case prediction

837
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,020
well not exactly yet because all the

838
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,480
operation we did on our bad basis on the

839
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,460
basis we were given at the beginning but

840
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,000
maybe in the basis we have at the end we

841
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,980
have uh information about this

842
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,140
randomization maybe we kept information

843
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,680
and so Oracle could use it this is not

844
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,140
perfectly independent of what happened

845
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,119
before

846
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,500
and we can't use anymore the the

847
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,900
we can choose anymore the The Hermit

848
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,220
normal form in order to discard

849
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,800
everything because now we are we

850
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,540
multiplied by gaussians we are in the

851
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,339
continuous world we don't have any more

852
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,560
polynomials which coefficient in Z we

853
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,720
have to somehow round uh module so how

854
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,180
are we going to do that well we're going

855
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,000
to to do what we call a

856
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
uh

857
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,359
Gershon running which is we are going to

858
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:14,940
compute a basis of the jewel of our

859
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,560
module

860
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,839
we are we are going to compute this

861
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,480
basis of that and to sample two points

862
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,760
in the Dual which are very orthogonal

863
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,619
since those four and we are going to

864
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,960
take the Matrix of of those two points

865
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,300
and to multiply on the left by it since

866
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,180
those problems are orthogonal this is

867
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,400
going to not change the geometry of

868
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,500
relatives very much

869
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,440
because it is almost an identity Matrix

870
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,960
right and since we are in the Dual

871
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,480
volatis well multiplying on the left by

872
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,800
this point is going to run everything

873
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,020
because because of the definition of the

874
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,859
Dual

875
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:53,220
so doing so this is an adaptation of the

876
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,180
the rounding in the

877
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,099
uh

878
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,190
um

879
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,880
[Music]

880
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,240
the paper about uh from the morgue but

881
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,740
generalized in the in two Dimensions so

882
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,640
by doing so we get the lattice module in

883
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,520
uh with integer entries and we can use

884
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,079
the normal form and we lose every

885
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,720
information we did along the way and

886
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,960
then we won now we have a real reduction

887
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,720
from from a worst case to average case

888
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,480
for modularity prevention

889
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,900
okay so I did hide quite a lot of things

890
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,540
so first first thing uh we worked about

891
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,640
name a field very long so you have to

892
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,140
take care of some number theoretic stuff

893
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,780
during the whole the whole thing uh the

894
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,839
material not necessarily free so you get

895
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,940
to use the ideal sdp solver in some case

896
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,160
this

897
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,460
step can take the decay of two numbers

898
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,560
of repetition and in some cases the kf2

899
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,619
is exponential the degree of the field

900
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,700
so that's another thing and I also

901
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,740
hide the predominal losses approximation

902
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,839
factor and the distribution analysis

903
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,119
which uses ready Divergence and the

904
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,920
statistical distance which was a bit

905
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,619
complicated

906
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,980
so yeah just to so now what we showed is

907
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,220
that all this blob of problems so and

908
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,660
through modular recipient rank two Etc

909
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,200
all these things are equivalent

910
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,440
and so I leave you with some problem so

911
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,319
first we need ideal SVP Oracle in order

912
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,420
to make some reduction which leads to a

913
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,579
distribution for entry instances in

914
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,040
which we can't really sample

915
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,859
right now so one thing would be to uh to

916
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,200
try and find a sampleable entry

917
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,839
distribution with the worst case the

918
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,140
hardness uh the composability for

919
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,619
addiction with the social decisions from

920
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:58,619
maristelli 21 is not yet proven and uh

921
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,020
for the most for for the most number

922
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,700
three rated guys and girls around here

923
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,440
determining which number of fields

924
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,060
verifies that the techie of two is

925
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,760
polynomial is is not uh it's not that

926
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
easy

927
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,880
so thank you very much for your

928
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,319
attention and if you have any question

929
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,520
feel free to reach me

930
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,800
you have time for one quick question

931
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,520
so I have

932
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,160
um how do you find the uh question

933
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,560
orthogonal basis in the door just follow

934
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,660
rounding

935
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,720
uh are you speaking about this uh that

936
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,819
one the one after this tip

937
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:51,900
okay so first we compute a basis for the

938
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,800
with lll for the for the Jewel and then

939
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,380
we sample uh gaussian with question

940
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,140
gaussian sampling two points that are

941
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,480
crazy orthogonal so first the first one

942
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,000
is sampled very close like centered

943
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,579
around the I don't know here it should

944
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,520
be a Lambda 1 0.

945
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,740
and we sample here and the second is

946
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,000
sample very near to uh uh zero Lambda

947
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
for some big Lambda

948
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,380
and then we get the two points that are

949
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,060
almost orthogonal because they are very

950
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,800
close to uh because they are very close

951
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,680
to 10801

952
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,740
thank you thank you uh can you come back

953
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,118
to the slide on and true

954
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,140
yeah so this one so I'm a bit confused

955
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,819
because in the original and true this is

956
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,220
not the ring we're using using x to the

957
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,640
N minus one and N is a prime so I was

958
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,500
wondering does your work apply also to

959
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,900
the actual intro or only to this

960
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,780
variation yeah that's a good question so

961
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,020
uh here I I chosen to present it for x

962
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,200
to the N plus one for for some like a

963
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,540
power to psychotomics but our work

964
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,339
generalizes to any number Fields

965
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:08,640
actually and we've got different losses

966
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,920
and different running times depending on

967
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,839
the discriminant of the number field

968
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,700
depending on

969
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,380
I think it's just so like the

970
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,060
discriminated number fields and the

971
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,940
degree so uh this uh I presented for x

972
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,280
to the two to the r plus one but it

973
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,500
works for the original and true it was

974
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,540
for intro prime it works for I don't

975
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,540
know a multicult article true with such

976
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,119
thing exists

977
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,640
thanks for the clarification so let's

978
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,680
thank the speaker again

979
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,640
foreign

980
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,859
our next talk is gonna be given online

981
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,500
it's about a non-euristic approach to

982
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,839
time space trade-off and optimization

983
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,800
for bkw by Honey Neo and uu

984
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,180
and the talk will be given by hanumin

985
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,460
thanks for your introduction hello

986
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,859
everyone I'm hanino from Shanghai

987
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,119
University

988
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,119
today I'm presenting our work on the bkw

989
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,660
algorithm

990
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,099
this is join work with my advisor

991
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,140
Professor UE

992
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,380
the LPN problem has two versions The

993
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,720
search LPN problem and the decisional

994
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,640
LPM problem

995
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,339
the search LPN problem is to figure out

996
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,140
the secret X

997
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,480
giving the public Matrix a and I know

998
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,339
it's called y

999
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,200
what's the probability measures a and

1000
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,500
the secret X are uniform your uniformly

1001
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,000
random

1002
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,599
so noise e needs to be sparse

1003
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,700
it is follows component wires

1004
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,439
independent bodily distribution

1005
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,780
in cryptographic more attention is paid

1006
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,020
to

1007
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,140
encryptography more attention is paid to

1008
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,380
the decisional LPN problem which is to

1009
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,660
distinguish LPN sample and the random

1010
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,420
sample two versions are polynomial

1011
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,960
equivalent

1012
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,660
the hardness of the

1013
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,460
hardness of the European problems were

1014
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,480
always

1015
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,420
based on the noise wheel

1016
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,359
understand LPN problem the noise well is

1017
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,319
constant

1018
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,020
meaning that it is independent of the

1019
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,200
independent independent independent of

1020
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,339
the dimension

1021
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:51,300
the best no attack is the bkwa region

1022
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,060
the pkw algorithm is a foster supplement

1023
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,460
special algorithm to solve the constant

1024
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,619
noise LPN problem

1025
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,960
poster the tongue and Sample complexity

1026
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,780
are two to turn over Logan

1027
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,780
the huge space is a huge example comes

1028
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,760
actually limits the application of the

1029
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,319
bkw algorithm

1030
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,960
so rubber TFC reduce the sample

1031
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,560
consecutive to a smaller polynomial

1032
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,700
however

1033
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,700
the time complexity is increased to two

1034
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,760
to earn over local login

1035
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,640
when many focus on optimizing the Big W

1036
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,180
algorithm

1037
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,460
option problems is not the focus of our

1038
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,760
people

1039
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
okay

1040
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,380
here we recall the process of the bkw

1041
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,660
algorithm suppose that we have the

1042
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,618
Alpine samples

1043
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,700
The Matrix is a random Matrix a and the

1044
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,839
next dot color is a noise codeword ax

1045
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,240
Class E

1046
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,540
first we can divide the Alpine samples

1047
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,720
into different groups based on the view

1048
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,900
of the Foster babies of the Matrix a

1049
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,380
there are two to be different groups in

1050
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,579
each group the Foster B of the

1051
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:17,780
coefficients have the sound View

1052
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,420
secondly for each group we X all the

1053
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,819
Foster law with the raster loss

1054
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,160
so that the Foster babies of the

1055
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,140
coefficients are all terrible

1056
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:34,380
finally we module module all results

1057
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,280
so we can get the LPN samples with a

1058
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,640
reduced Dimension and the double noise

1059
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,240
double noise means that the resulting

1060
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,720
noise is xor of two previous noise

1061
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,460
moreover

1062
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,640
but by doing way lose the two to be

1063
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,839
samples

1064
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:58,140
because in each group the first samples

1065
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,140
is dropped out and they are two to be

1066
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,980
different groups

1067
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,260
always sure is the first iteration in

1068
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,119
each information

1069
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,760
the dimension of the LPN problem is

1070
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,980
reduced by B bits and the double noise

1071
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,059
we can do an overb iterations and reduce

1072
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,160
the dimension of the European problems

1073
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,578
to one

1074
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,619
we summarize the airplane or the main

1075
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,740
idea of the Big W algorithm

1076
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,400
after an orb Integrations we figured out

1077
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,140
two to earn overb vectors which sums up

1078
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,960
to a unit vector

1079
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,900
and the final noise is the sum of two to

1080
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,260
earn over B initial noise

1081
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,619
so finalize is so huge and we need to

1082
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:53,160
repeat the above processor many times

1083
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,460
on the fresh new samples

1084
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,460
to fresh new samples can guarantees that

1085
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,980
the independence of the phenoloids

1086
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,160
felony we do a majority rules to figure

1087
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,339
out the first bit of the secret

1088
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,940
the process of recovering the attribute

1089
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,099
of the secret is Networks

1090
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:22,500
for example we analyze the quantity of

1091
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,780
the BTW algorithm to save the LPN

1092
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,280
problems with a constant noise

1093
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,200
so this comes actually is a 2 to B

1094
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,240
what's the time and the sample comes

1095
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,660
actually are 2 to B times 2 2 2 2 and

1096
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,760
over log n

1097
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,099
to in order to minimize the time

1098
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:44,640
complexity we have to set b as earn over

1099
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,540
log n to make two terms in the sum old

1100
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,900
so the time and the space complexity all

1101
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,300
keep 2 to n over log n

1102
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,000
actually there are some questions

1103
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,839
faster so bkw algorithm has a huge space

1104
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,900
and a sample complexity so the bqw

1105
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,180
algorithm will benefit from some

1106
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,359
trade-off to make it more practical for

1107
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,420
example time space trade-off and the

1108
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,900
sample and the time samples trade-off

1109
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,240
question number two there are enough

1110
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,440
walls

1111
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,720
in the first step

1112
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,480
but there was a lot independent in order

1113
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,880
to get independent votes the BTW

1114
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,579
acquisition needs to replace the first

1115
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,619
step maintenance

1116
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,980
so how to remove the repeat step and

1117
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,119
save the corresponding effect

1118
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,119
recently also at all purpose the time

1119
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,880
space trade-off for the bkw algorithm

1120
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,859
which we call the processor of this

1121
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,900
trade-off

1122
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,680
first we pick C minus one we'll find the

1123
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,559
LPN public appeal samples and X all the

1124
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,839
together

1125
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:04,680
secondly we figure out another samples

1126
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,980
whose Foster base have the sound view as

1127
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,500
the result of the Foster sample step

1128
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,240
finally we X all two samples to get a

1129
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,660
new samples and loop many times to get

1130
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,940
enough view samples

1131
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,280
all we showed is the first intervention

1132
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,839
in each iteration the dimension is

1133
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,599
reduced by BBS and the resulting noise

1134
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,960
is the sum of three previous nodes

1135
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,260
notice that the resulting samples are a

1136
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,599
lot of mutual independent

1137
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,839
so they introduced the independence

1138
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,660
heuristic to fix it

1139
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,700
after many interventions

1140
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,640
we reduce the dimension of LPN problems

1141
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,460
to one so that we can discover the

1142
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,780
correspondent

1143
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,559
who did it

1144
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,160
this is this algorithm is called the nav

1145
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,440
system algorithm

1146
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,500
say optimize it by decisional technique

1147
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,119
and the quantum algorithm

1148
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,599
so main contribution of our work is a

1149
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:23,220
framework to optimize the bkw algorithm

1150
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,980
compared with a single list in the

1151
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,500
original pqw algorithm we have a menu

1152
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,520
list this list are mutually independent

1153
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,980
within each list will only requires that

1154
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,180
all vectors are power is independent

1155
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,400
so that's the off steps are the same as

1156
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,280
the original bkw equation we prove that

1157
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,980
the pair was independent were observed

1158
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,200
from all needs done to root

1159
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,099
thanks to the power as independent

1160
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,440
they can analyze the complexity of all

1161
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,460
algorithms without using any heuristic

1162
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,059
at the same time our algorithm does not

1163
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,280
need to repeat step

1164
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,980
and only do majority votes in the

1165
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,540
initial l

1166
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,400
Indonesia 2 1.

1167
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:20,339
so we reduce the time complexity of the

1168
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,319
original BTW algorithm while sub

1169
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,040
exponential effect

1170
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,579
we give example to show how to

1171
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:31,740
preserve the

1172
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,058
hell was independent

1173
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,900
suppose the Mr

1174
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,940
l0i are mutual independent

1175
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,040
and within each list

1176
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,200
all vectors are powers independent

1177
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,400
it is easy to Short

1178
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,040
foreign

1179
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,500
dependent

1180
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,720
it is easy to show that if the size of

1181
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,280
Lister l0i allows lesser than 2 to B

1182
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,500
plus 1 over C minus one so by chip shift

1183
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,400
inequality the size of Mr l11 has the

1184
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,940
sum bound

1185
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,599
we showed that on Easter in in the

1186
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,099
second level are also mutually

1187
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,040
independent because the shortlisted are

1188
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,680
mutually independent

1189
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,380
using the sound well we can analyze the

1190
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,839
harming weight of the noise find olives

1191
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:45,540
down to the root

1192
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,480
so we only do the majority vote

1193
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,119
in the list

1194
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:55,700
l21 to recover the secret of LPN

1195
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,020
with the help of our framework we get a

1196
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,540
sound result as the work of Esso at all

1197
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,020
but without use any heuristic we

1198
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,300
introduced let's say to do the time

1199
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,000
space trade-off if the sale equal to 2

1200
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,760
then the complexity of our algorithm is

1201
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,059
the same as state of our original BWI

1202
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:20,359
region

1203
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,119
if we increase the C we get a large time

1204
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,500
space

1205
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,140
a logical tank complexity and the

1206
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:32,279
smaller space consecutive

1207
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,200
we can also use the decision

1208
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,720
decision technique and Quantum algorithm

1209
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,119
to force optimize our algorithm

1210
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,660
beta is also used to adjusting

1211
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,980
the time space trade-off

1212
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,619
our algorithm can optimize the time

1213
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:55,140
space complexity of the original BTW

1214
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,859
aggregation we compare of our algorithm

1215
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,980
and with the original pkw algorithm and

1216
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,839
resolution work of debit us at all

1217
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:11,000
we can save a sub-exponential effect

1218
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,579
Dubai chips G introduced the sample

1219
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:16,380
amplifier to reduce the sample

1220
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,720
consecutive to a smaller polynomial

1221
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,059
such as earn over

1222
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,260
into one plus episode while Epsilon is a

1223
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,619
constant

1224
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,140
first to randomly pick many W triples

1225
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:39,859
from N2 1 plus Epsilon sample

1226
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:45,599
secondly x o h w triples as a real LPN

1227
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,960
sample

1228
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,660
foreign

1229
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,319
[Music]

1230
00:59:57,319 --> 00:59:59,819
sample is very close to the real

1231
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,779
airplane sample

1232
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,180
finally invoke the original PW equation

1233
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,700
to recover the secret of the LPN problem

1234
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,460
our sample amplifier is a little

1235
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,540
different

1236
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,859
faster

1237
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:19,859
we explained the airplane sample into a

1238
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:22,680
login group and each group has the same

1239
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,980
size

1240
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:29,280
second for each group we pick all W

1241
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,020
triples and X all HW tables

1242
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,760
so we get

1243
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,559
each initial for each group

1244
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:45,119
send the list are mutual independent and

1245
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,119
within each list all vectors are powered

1246
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:52,140
independent W is equal to an overlooked

1247
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:56,040
Times log Logan in our algorithm

1248
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,980
finally we invoke our optimizing

1249
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,160
optimize toolsum bkw algorithm

1250
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,180
to recover the secrets of LPN problem

1251
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,880
compare compare with the Luba chips G

1252
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,339
trade-off we consider some exponential

1253
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:13,440
Factor

1254
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,760
this is all thank you

1255
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,420
for one quick question

1256
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,180
okay so let's thank the speaker again

1257
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,420
the final talk of this session is

1258
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,640
improving down on lft curve hidden

1260
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,599
June 2 Santa news

1261
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:23,819
and Lake pool and the talk I believe

1262
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:28,160
will be given by two ensu

1263
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,359
hello everyone thank you for

1264
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,599
introduction my name is I'm from

1265
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:39,180
institution of information engineering

1266
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:43,260
challenge Academy of Science the code

1267
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,420
authors are sometimes the car

1268
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:52,079
now let me talk about our paper the

1269
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,619
title is improving funds on elliptical

1270
01:02:55,619 --> 01:03:00,660
code number problem for short easy hmp

1271
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,480
for ecth King Exchange

1272
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,640
easy actionp can be first introduced by

1273
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,020
and Temple hello and how great at the

1274
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,520
alien 2001 in order to expect the result

1275
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,700
of bit security for ecth

1276
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:31,859
2017 shining introduced a TV Hermann

1277
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:37,740
Warren of BC hmp called easy hmpx or

1278
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,000
Chinese easy actually

1279
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,299
the first rigorous with security result

1280
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:49,680
of ecth on a fixed curve

1281
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,960
similar to hmp Chinese EC hmp can be

1282
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,240
used for

1283
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,619
group analysis of EC th King Exchange in

1284
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:06,000
the case of side cello attacks

1285
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,299
foreign

1286
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,660
PX for a given elliptical curve over

1287
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,819
Prime field a given point R so R is

1288
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:28,079
public and a positive data

1289
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,599
and let p is a hidden point in a given

1290
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:34,640
eligible

1291
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,859
curve let the o

1292
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:47,160
the data MSB of the X call or delete our

1293
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,299
P plus M multiply r

1294
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:56,940
so we load the partial information of

1295
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:03,359
a hidden Point P plus M multiply M the

1296
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:07,160
goal is to recall the hidden Point P

1297
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,000
given the current access to the Oracle o

1298
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,500
the location data over log p means the

1299
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,400
output fraction of X called Outlet bit

1300
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,520
per iteration

1301
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:29,280
and the previous result at a pkc 2017 a

1302
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,579
rigorous Bank 506

1303
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:36,480
was put forward use a director that is

1304
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,280
method

1305
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,319
at DCC paper a heuristic fund one over

1306
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:47,640
two was given use the Corpus method

1307
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,799
clearly the one over two bound is better

1308
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:56,520
so the question is how to improve the

1309
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,579
one over two bank

1310
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:02,940
in this worker we give the following

1311
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,020
result

1312
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,020
let d

1313
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:10,440
be a only given positive integer

1314
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,380
given a enough large Prime

1315
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,140
um the easy hmp problem can be

1316
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,160
heuristically served when the bound

1317
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,539
when the bank is 1 over D plus one

1318
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:31,260
our method is a polynomial time in the

1319
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,559
log t for the only constant d

1320
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,859
when D greater than one the bound

1321
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:43,559
outbound one over t plus one is better

1322
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,660
finally

1323
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:49,319
we showed that one characteristically

1324
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:52,079
compute all the bits

1325
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,559
for a given elliptical curve over the

1326
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:59,339
prime field if the Oracle outputs any

1327
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:03,780
constantial fraction of the MSD of the x

1328
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,940
coordinate

1329
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,020
however in their previous work only for

1330
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:14,940
some constant function such as pkc gives

1331
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:22,160
the 5 over 6 PCC gives 1 over 2.

1332
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,260
now let me introduce how to transform

1333
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,660
this problem

1334
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:33,660
from Chinese EC hmp

1335
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:38,339
two the modular polynomials

1336
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,660
um recover the x coordinate of the

1337
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,579
heightened Point p

1338
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,940
can be transformed into the problem of

1339
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,000
the fighting the desired small route of

1340
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,720
the modular polymers f i

1341
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,740
f i the monomies is 1 x 0 x 0 squared y

1342
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:08,400
i x 0 squared multiply y i x 0 squared

1343
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,299
multiplied by I

1344
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:17,160
and where x0 is a common variable the

1345
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,479
coefficient

1346
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,339
the koi fish are lowing the integers the

1347
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:24,420
integers

1348
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,439
e0 and so on are unloading

1349
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:32,100
they are bound by a value big X

1350
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,799
big X is equals p over 2 2 Prime data

1351
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:41,520
the corresponding analysis was given by

1352
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,960
sunny at pkc

1353
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,198
so I'll go

1354
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:53,819
is to recover the desired route

1355
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:57,540
in the polynomial time such that the

1356
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:02,279
bank big X is as large as possible

1357
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:06,238
for a fixed Prime key

1358
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,979
big X the bond becomes larger if and

1359
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:16,219
only if that the lowing bits data

1360
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:19,738
becomes small because of

1361
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:25,319
big x equals p over 2 2 Data

1362
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,399
we resist the cops Miss method to save

1363
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,660
the Chinese

1364
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,339
easy hmp

1365
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:35,399
the cops with method was proposed by

1366
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:39,299
cops Miss in the liking lighting 6.

1367
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,640
the Corpus message have the many

1368
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,060
applications such as corporate analysis

1369
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,738
of RSA a tank of solder random number

1370
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:53,759
generator and so on

1371
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,120
in the captions method they have a

1372
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,540
important lotion of the help for helpful

1373
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,340
polymer

1374
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:06,420
so G is a helpful polymer

1375
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:10,080
if it's triangular element

1376
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,380
is bound by the mode P2 power d

1377
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:20,580
so I have for polymer is added to the

1378
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,179
lattice it makes the corpse basic

1379
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:27,300
condition easier to satisfy

1380
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,860
in other words

1381
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:34,020
the more careful polymers the larger the

1382
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,179
boundary Acts

1383
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:40,620
compared to DCC paper we construct

1384
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:45,080
enough have four columnares

1385
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:48,179
concretely speak

1386
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:53,400
for a fixed tube G1 G2 and so on WE

1387
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,820
considered some linear combination of

1388
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,219
the following polymer

1389
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:04,500
this polymer is a product of several

1390
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,159
original polonomics

1391
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,199
so and the polynomial in the expression

1392
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,840
2 are usually called

1393
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,500
shifter polynomials in the Corpus Corpus

1394
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:24,480
method so we constructed some linear

1395
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,219
population of the shifter voluminous

1396
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:32,340
as such a linear compilations can be

1397
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,659
proved to be a helpful polymers

1398
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,140
furthermore the number of this help for

1399
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,840
Columbus is or un choose t plus one

1400
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,560
which is a dominant in the total number

1401
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,940
this is the key to our work

1402
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,960
for example a small example given two

1403
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,480
original

1404
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,199
polynomials

1405
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,860
F1 F2

1406
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:12,540
is 1 0 x 0 x 0 squared y i x 0 multiply

1407
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,159
y i

1408
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,820
X zero squared multiply y i we construct

1409
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,060
a linear combination of the following

1410
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,679
polymers

1411
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:24,239
F1

1412
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,620
F2

1413
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:31,980
F zeros multiply F1 F0 multiply F2 y 1

1414
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,420
multiply

1415
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:39,480
F2 Y2 multiply F1 F 0 multiply F2

1416
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:45,840
multiply y1 F 0 multiply F1 multiply f y

1417
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,100
2.

1418
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:52,320
so the possible monomers are divided two

1419
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:57,600
parts the blue parts and the red parts

1420
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,540
in the linear compilation

1421
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:05,100
the monomers with red color

1422
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,840
are mission

1423
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,400
in other words

1424
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,960
the red parts

1425
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,020
are disappeared

1426
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,260
so in the linear compilation they are

1427
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:23,640
monomers are one x0 y1 x0 multiply y1 Y2

1428
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,400
x0 multiply Y2

1429
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,219
by 1 multiply by two

1430
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:33,960
the knitting term is y1 Y2

1431
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,780
and let them let me give a latex for

1432
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:40,739
this example we construct a triangle

1433
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:42,120
basis

1434
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,560
Matrix

1435
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,400
this is a 4 is to a seven seven

1436
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,280
polynomials

1437
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,179
where the G7 is about

1438
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,400
linear compilation

1439
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,460
in India cooperation

1440
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:03,420
so the latest air is bound by the

1441
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:07,260
coefficient Vector of GI

1442
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,520
I from 1 to 7.

1443
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,739
we can compute

1444
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:17,820
compute The Matrix the determinants is

1445
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:22,940
equals P to power 6 multiply big X

1446
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:27,000
multiplied and two Power Nine the

1447
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,040
dimension is a seven

1448
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,400
is seven based on the cops means

1449
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,500
condition we get

1450
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,239
the the bound big X is more than P to

1451
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:42,360
power one over line

1452
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:48,960
notice that the angular element of G7

1453
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,280
triangular element is X big x square is

1454
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,060
smaller than p 2 power

1455
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,120
2 over 9.

1456
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,760
this is more than p

1457
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,020
so G7 is a heavy for polymer

1458
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,719
we used to in love have a problem and

1459
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,199
get the final punch

1460
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:22,020
is Big X is smaller than p 2 power

1461
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:27,659
1 minus 1 over D plus one because of

1462
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:32,580
x equals p over 2 2 Data

1463
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:36,300
in other words better over log p is

1464
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,900
greater than 1 over D plus one

1465
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,480
for only

1466
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,199
positive integer d

1467
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:47,340
but

1468
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,080
the better

1469
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:53,820
Bank from TCC pipe is a big X is smaller

1470
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,800
than P2

1471
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,080
power 1 minus 1 over 2.

1472
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,679
it means the theater Overlook key is

1473
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:08,880
greater than one over two so this works

1474
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,600
bound is significantly better than the

1475
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,699
GCC pipe bound because

1476
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:21,060
greater one greater than one

1477
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:25,679
um this part is better than one over two

1478
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,300
but

1479
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:31,320
um our method is a heuristic because to

1480
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,179
compute the desired root we use the

1481
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:39,360
groupular basis in this process we need

1482
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,480
the following assumption

1483
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,920
now this assumption mean is the zero

1484
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,320
Dimension ideal

1485
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,820
it means the common these polynomials

1486
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,520
are common rules

1487
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,179
the lump of the common Roots is a violet

1488
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:03,120
this is a typical assumption for the

1489
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,140
Corpus method in this paper we justify

1490
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,659
the

1491
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:12,600
heuristics by the experiments use the

1492
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,860
small dimension of lattice

1493
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:21,900
so conclusion we significantly improved

1494
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:25,739
the bank for the seven chalice EC hmp

1495
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:28,980
because of heuristic in the complex

1496
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:31,980
method we did a lot get the regular

1497
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,280
speech security result

1498
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,559
that's all thank you for your attention

1499
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:53,780
we have time for one question

1500
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,640
foreign

1501
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,120
the speaker again

1502
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:11,659
thank you
