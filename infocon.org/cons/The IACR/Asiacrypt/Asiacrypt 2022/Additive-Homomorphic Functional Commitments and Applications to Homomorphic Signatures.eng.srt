00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,879
hello everyone so I'm Dario Fury from

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
India I'd like to advertise our work on

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,779
a digital Murphy functional commitments

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,580
and applicationsomorphic signatures

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,440
which is joint work with direct adelan

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,700
and Diet Attack

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,799
so this is about uh functional

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,960
commitments uh which is a notion uh

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,320
proposed in 2016 by Liberty Jung uh and

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,060
it was proposed as a generalization of

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,740
the more popular Notions of vector

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,779
commitments and polynomial communities

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,880
so the idea of functional commitments is

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,099
that we have two parties a sender and

15
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,740
the receiver and we think of the sender

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,800
as a you know big party that can hold a

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,040
large Vector X and the receiver is of

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,000
with little resources and um the idea is

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,980
that the sender wants to commit to this

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,399
Vector X give this commitment to the um

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,039
receiver and then at later points in

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,980
time he wants to compute some function

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,460
on the committed data give the result uh

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,559
to the receiver but also give some

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,840
opening proofs so in the opening proof

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,300
uh should convince the the receiver that

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,640
uh the result Y is actually obtained by

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,640
uh uh all you know what uh opens the

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
commitment

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,540
so the property that makes a functional

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,979
commitments and interesting and on

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,320
trivial primitive is succeedness

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
and this informally says that the size

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,700
of openings and commitments should be

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,180
short with respect to the input sites

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,540
and ideally should be constant

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,080
so uh in the security property of

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,939
um functional commitments is evolution

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,579
mining which informally says you cannot

40
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,799
have a malicious sender that with

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,900
computational computationally speaking

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,759
can open a commitment to two different

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,860
outputs for the same function

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,259
so um so in this sense functional

45
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,280
commitments if you look at the um

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,200
functionality are like a weaker version

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,320
of committed Bruce Knox in which uh the

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,960
strong notion of a soundness in snark

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,840
that is about producing one single uh

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
proof for a false statement it's

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
replaced with this Evolution binding

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
which the adverses should produce two

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,139
proofs for disagreeing statements now um

54
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,819
given this observation it is an

55
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,500
interesting question that of whether

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
like uh we can't replace not with

57
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,819
functional commitments in some

58
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,980
applications with the benefit of uh

59
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
having a notion with these falsifiable

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,879
and potentially realizable from

61
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,980
falsifiable assumptions

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,020
so in this work we actually start from

63
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,459
this question and we ask in which

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,200
applications evaluation binding is

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
sufficient and we have said that um you

66
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,319
know our very first uh result is this

67
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,879
observation that if you sign a

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,500
functional commitment this yields a very

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,019
basic notion of amorphic signatures well

70
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,540
we push this idea uh even further and

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
observe that if the function of

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,660
commitment is not the demomorphic then

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,940
we yield a multi-imbutomorphic

74
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,400
signatures by pairing it with the

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,959
linearlyomorphic signature and

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,540
interestingly like this gives a new

77
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,459
paradigm for building theseomorphic

78
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,379
signatures because uh

79
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,599
uh the amorphic signature would support

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,239
the same class of functions supported by

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,060
the functional commitment and also we um

82
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,980
you know if a commitment is a digital

83
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,840
morphic it's also updatable in these

84
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,940
yields other applications

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,920
so the next question is whether they're

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,840
exists or can we construct a digital

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,120
morphic functional commitments and

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,099
unfortunately if we look at the state of

89
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,140
the art only the skins for linear

90
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,239
functions are added geomorphic so our

91
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,819
main results are the first

92
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,319
additivomorphic function commitments for

93
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,080
functions Beyond linear and we have one

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,819
scheme for constant degree polynomials

95
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,040
and another scheme for uh circus in the

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,580
class nc1 and these schemes have also

97
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,680
implications to pneumomorphic signatures

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
basal bearings and I will not tell you

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
more than this in this talk uh I really

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
invite you to come and listen to our

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,920
talks at azure
