00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,359
hello everyone my name is yulong Chen

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,700
and welcome to my abstract presentation

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,660
of my paper

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,460
due to the shot three hash function

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,680
competition more and more consumptions

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,539
are built on public presentations

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,660
examples includes box ciphers for

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,599
example this two round

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,579
pickup box office this attitude for

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,420
video Monsoon prfs where um yeah this is

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,760
the sum of Ivana sure and it's another

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,219
pif which is supplementation based

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,879
variants of encrypted status barrier

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,879
we also have mac algorithms which is

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,600
implementation based and ehtm and this

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,739
tccr hash function for MPC applications

17
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,199
we see all those constructions are built

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,160
on two public limitations the reason for

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,440
this is because this is a minimum number

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,680
of apprentive evaluations needed to

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,159
achieve the young person about security

22
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,979
today that they most of constructions in

23
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,700
symmetric key cryptography are truths

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,040
using Edge coefficient technique

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
the idea behind the edge coefficient

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,180
technique is that there is only a small

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,000
set which appears with higher

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,280
probability than the other and the small

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,380
set of transcript that's appears with

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,960
type probability than the other that is

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,820
actually the bad transcript

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,939
then the advantage of the adversary is

33
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,280
actually bounded by this blue Epsilon

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,420
term and this green probability in order

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,540
to perform the proof using electrical

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,939
fission Technique we need to perform the

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,920
following three steps

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,200
first we need to define the batch

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,579
transcript

40
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,100
then we need to bounce the probability

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,380
of the batch transcripts in the ideal

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,159
world

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,380
and the last step we need to calculate

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,140
this blue Epsilon which is related to

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,318
the probability of the butcher's grids

46
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,340
in the real world with that in the ideal

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,239
world

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,700
so we can see that's the second step

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,879
this group probability of the battering

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,700
stress groups in the ideal world is

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
actually a totally combinatorial problem

52
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,040
it only relies on the randomness of the

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,860
used keys for the first and the last

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,800
steps actually totally depends on the

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,620
construction itself

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,260
we see that the success in the previous

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,860
slide are all looks very similar then

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,319
there arises a question whether it's

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
possible to find a motor approach for

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
the first and the third step such that

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
no yeah dedicate proof need to be

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,760
performed every time when the new

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,220
construction is designed in order to

64
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,260
answer this question we first need to

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,459
recap

66
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,620
um Butler's meal Theory it's a technique

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,280
used to determine the solution to a

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
system of bavares equations that

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,760
non-egrations

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,099
in order to do that we need to represent

71
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,540
this

72
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,780
um system by a graph where a distinct

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,140
unknown is actually represented by a

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,440
vertex and integration is represented by

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
a number labeled edge and a low equation

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,800
by a Lambda dots labeled Edge

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,879
then the transcripts graph should

78
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,159
satisfies the following properties first

79
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,019
it shouldn't contain a circle for

80
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,019
example if we have this case then here

81
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,000
it says the distance between those two

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,459
nodes is equals one by one well this

83
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,200
also says that the distance between

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,239
those two nodes is equal to Lambda 2

85
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
which is inconsistent

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,860
the graph shouldn't contain any cell

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,720
path label because if we have this

88
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,720
situation then the other distance

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,940
between those two notes is one that I

90
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,260
want the distance between those two

91
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,959
nodes is also equal to one dot well yeah

92
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,140
those are more the same load

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,680
the last property is related to the

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,100
London those labeled edges so the relay

95
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,019
through the normal equations it says

96
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,019
that there shouldn't be any circles with

97
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,080
a Lambda dots labeled Edge such as this

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,660
Lambda dot is equal to the sum of all

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,120
the lumbar labels in the circle so if we

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,340
have this situation then it says the

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,900
distance between those two nodes is

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,180
equal to Lambda while the distance

103
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,520
between those two notes is not equal to

104
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,160
one of those when Lambda dot is equal to

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,100
Lambda then it's inconsistent so those

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,199
are actually the properties that are

107
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,900
used to define the bad transcript

108
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,540
however new theory is

109
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,240
um as mean for Block Cipher based

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,940
constructions so in order to use it on

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
the permutation based con functions we

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,400
need to generalize the idea so we in

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
this work we focus on on construction

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,800
sets can be Fields like

115
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,400
um the following structure where a b and

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
d are actually functions of secret key

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
inputs and the outputs

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,620
then the security analysis of such

119
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,199
construction is usually performed in the

120
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,860
ideal permutation model where it accepts

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,020
the query to the construction the

122
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,539
attacker also has query access to the

123
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,479
underlying Primitives i1 and Pi 2 which

124
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,479
are modeled as random therefore in order

125
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,780
to use the new Theory we need to handle

126
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,120
those primitive queries we will present

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,460
those primitive graphs by

128
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,320
um unified situations and add those

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
ingredients to the system

130
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,759
then we need to generalize the meal

131
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,340
Theory the resolving Theory can be

132
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,039
applied to different constructions in

133
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,680
our work we apply this to the trickball

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,360
if my suiciple it's crypto 2015 the

135
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,100
implementation based EDM prf it's task

136
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,759
2021 and the implementation based and

137
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,440
ehtm Mac algorithm at Africa equipped in

138
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,319
2020.

139
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,180
using our model approach we can simply

140
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,340
see that there is actually a flow in the

141
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,039
security proof of this Mac algorithm

142
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,860
which um yeah the proof is now fixed

143
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,580
here and in my other paper without us

144
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,680
you see two different approaches

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,380
so using the new technique we can show

146
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,819
them you'll use the security of those

147
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,880
three constructions in a very simple way

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
without performing dedicated

149
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,440
security analysis each time now for each

150
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,139
construction so the full presentation of

151
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,440
this work can be found on Asian food

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,520
thank you for your attention
