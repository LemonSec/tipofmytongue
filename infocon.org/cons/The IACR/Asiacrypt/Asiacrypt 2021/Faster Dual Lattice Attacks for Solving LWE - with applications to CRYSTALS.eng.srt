00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,879
hello welcome to my talk

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,520
i will present a paper entitled faster

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,400
due lattice attacks for solving lwe with

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,400
applications to crystals

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,679
this is a joint work with thomas johnson

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,560
we are from lund university now i give

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,039
the outlier of the paper i will start

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
with introduction then i will present

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
the new algorithm and its applications

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
i will later present

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,960
the experimental verification of the

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,519
algorithm and finally the conclusions of

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,800
the paper

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,280
now let's start with the introduction

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
we know that we are facing threats from

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,120
quantum computers

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
the currently used public key

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
cryptosystems based on factoring

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
discrete log will be broken by short

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
algorithm if a sufficiently large

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
quantum computer is

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
built

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,719
we already see rapid advances in

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
building quantum

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
computers recently

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,199
for instance google has claimed its

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,760
quantum supremacy

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,959
it's important to start a post-quantum

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
cryptography to find new solutions that

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
can resist attacks from large quantum

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,640
computers

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
the core effort is the nice post-quantum

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
cryptographies project to find

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
replacement for public key encryption

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
and signature standards

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
now this process is in eighth third

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
round and seven finalists are selected

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,360
among them the majority are lattice

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
based for instance three out of four

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
chem and pke finalists are latest based

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
such as

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,840
cyber kyber and untrue

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
also two out of three signature

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
finalists are lettuce-based

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,840
falcon and the lissama here kyber and

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
the delisima are from a package called

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,200
crystals

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
so why lattice-based crypto

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,759
system are so attractive

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
one main reason is that we can

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
have secured reduction to hard lattice

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
problems means that we can achieve

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
probable security

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
one may branch in lattice-based

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,318
cryptography is cryptosystems based on

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
learning with errors and its variants

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
for instance lwr and their ring and ring

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
and modular versions

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
for crypto based on lwe we have

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
average case to worst case reduction and

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
based on lw we can build very efficient

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
cryptographic primitives and the

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
applications can be versatile for

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,519
instance we can achieve

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,760
advanced construction such as fully

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,599
homomorphic encryptions based on lw then

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
the concrete security of this

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
cryptosystem can be related to solving

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
an lw instance

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,080
so it's important to study the concrete

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
complexity of solving lw

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
so what is the learning with errors

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,280
problem

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
usually this problem is defined with an

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
lw oracle with this parameters nq and

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
the noise distribution kind

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,200
we fix a secret vector s

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
and this oracle will uniformly pick a

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
vector a

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,720
and it will picks uh it picks a noise

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,360
from this noise distribution and this

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
oracle will output the pair a and b

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,920
where b is

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,879
the in the product of a s plus this

85
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,800
noise e

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,599
so

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,200
for these pqc candidates usually this

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
noise distribution chi is modeled or

89
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,560
approximated as a discrete gaussian with

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
mean serum standard deviation sigma m

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
the secret s is sampled from the same

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
distribution or from another

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
distribution that can be even smaller or

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
sparser

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
so we can formulate the secret

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
distribution as a discrete gaussian with

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
mean zero and the standard deviation

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
sigma s well here

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,239
sigma n

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
is c times sigma s for such candidates

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
the number of samples is usually limited

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
it could be slightly larger than

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,400
n the known approaches for solving lwe

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
can be characterized into three main

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
categories

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
the first one is algebraic approaches

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
including aurora and its extension of

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,238
using

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,880
global basis algorithms

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,479
so this type of algorithms are of main

111
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,639
asymptotic interest

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,680
the second

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
branch is the combinatorial approaches

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
like bkw style algorithms which

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
generally require a large number of

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
samples

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
the most relevant attacks is the

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
lattice-based attacks including primal

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
and dew attacks because do attacks is

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
the main target of this paper so we

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
introduce it further here so the aim of

122
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
do attacks is to find a short vector uv

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,520
in this two lattice

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
then giving a sequence of lwe instances

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
then we compute the inner product of w

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
and b then we get this term

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
we see that this is small here small

128
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
means that the standard deviation is

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
small because you see s and e are

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
sampled from sparse distributions and

131
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
v w

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
is short

133
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
so this distribution can be

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
distinguished from the uniform

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
distribution when starting executive

136
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
parameters for lattice-based primitives

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
we usually study bkc reduction algorithm

138
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
which block wisely called oracles to

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,880
solve a shortest vector problem

140
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
asymptotically

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,600
the best svp oracles are implemented by

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
cving so we have this notation

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
bkc beta d here beta is svp dimension

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
and d is the lattice dimension we have a

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,639
important

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,440
model to estimate the cost of

147
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,759
svp oracle called coral svp proposed in

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
this famous new whole paper

149
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
the main idea is to keep the main

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,319
complex term and discard the

151
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,720
sub-exponential term so in this model

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,199
ceiling can produce this many short

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
vectors and the classic sieving

154
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
complexity is 2 to 0.292 beta and

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
quantum sieving complex exists

156
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
so this coral svp model is very good

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,000
because we can compare the security

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
strengths of different lattice-based

159
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
proposals but

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
this model is just still just an

161
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
approximation

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
because the discarded sub exponential

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
complexity terms can be significant

164
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
we have a new research problem that

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
giving cost numbers represented in the

166
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
course svp model

167
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
how to determine if this number

168
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
meets the

169
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,560
security requirements

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,919
from nist

171
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
which is represented in the gate count

172
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,759
metric

173
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
in europe 2018 lukas showed a

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
significant gain called dimensions for

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,840
frame means that svp in dimension beta

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
could be solved using a sieve in a

177
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
smaller dimension and later apple shadow

178
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
in asia cup 2020 first they started the

179
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
classic call and the quantum complexity

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
of cv in the ram model here ram means

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
random access machine so this research

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,800
allows us to study the concrete

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
complexity of lattice reduction

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
algorithms without removing the sub

185
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
exponential terms based on this research

186
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
in the official documents of

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
round three kyber and ellison

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
the designers started beyond core svp

189
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
harness means a classic gate come metric

190
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
in the ram model

191
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,879
they also take into consideration

192
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,680
of

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
progressive sieving but they only

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,240
consider primal lattice attacks they

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
dismissed the do lattice attacks because

196
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
first most of those vectors are larger

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
by a factor of

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
square root of 4 over 3. secondly the

199
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
trick of exploiting all those vectors is

200
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
not compatible with the dimension for

201
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,199
free trick

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
this sentence is cited from the run 3

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
official document

204
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
of the lissama here we call the trick of

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
exploiting all those factors the msv

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
game our main research question is

207
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
should we dismiss two lattice attacks

208
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
when selecting parameters in

209
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
lattice-based cryptography here we focus

210
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
on the ram model

211
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
our answer is no

212
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
actually we can exploit both games

213
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,640
the both the e4f gain and the msv game

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,360
and we can still outperform primal

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
attacks even though the short vectors

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
are larger by effect of this compared

217
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
with the shortest vector we also saw

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
better classical and quantum

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
attack results in the core svp model

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
please read the paper

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
and other memory models are beyond the

222
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
scope of the paper now i will present

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,160
the new algorithm how we present the new

224
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,920
fft distinguish

225
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
this distinguishes similar to the famous

226
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
blanchard by has attack on ecdsa when

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,600
the alphabetic size is too large he use

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
a reduced size of signal points

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
similarly we reduce alphabet size for

230
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
fft from q2 gamma

231
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
where gamma is an element invertible

232
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
element in the queue thus the fft

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,560
dimension can be larger also a standard

234
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
deviation of the remaining noise from

235
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
fft can be reduced by a factor of gamma

236
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
now we'll give a more mathematical

237
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,399
description

238
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,320
so we rewrite the lw samples as aj hat

239
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
and bg by right a j hat to be gamma

240
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
times h in modular q then this is

241
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,440
equivalent to rewrite as

242
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
hat to be inverse of gamma times s

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
for example we assume gamma to be true

244
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
then the inverse of gamma is q plus 1

245
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
over 2. then we write this

246
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
equation in the integer form so we

247
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
compute this f function

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
for all possible

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
s modulus 2 we see that we operate on t

250
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
positions so there are two 2t

251
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
possibilities

252
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
we know that for the right guess the

253
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,200
computed value is of this format so if

254
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,839
we can use some reduction algorithms to

255
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,560
reduce to reduce aig hat to be small

256
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
then we know that

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
this

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
variable

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,959
is small because the standard deviations

260
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,000
of the random variables s i and e j are

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,959
small otherwise because q is very large

262
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,519
then this distribution is

263
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
close to uniform for

264
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
a run gas we know that the computation

265
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
can be accelerated by fft now i could

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
introduce the framework of the new dual

267
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
lattice attacks

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
in the first step we map the entries in

269
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
the matrix a so we will write a into

270
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
three sub-matrix a0 a1 hat and a2

271
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
a2 corresponds to the lost t1 columns

272
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
and the 8 one hat corresponds to the

273
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
next t columns we write a1 to be gamma

274
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
times a1 hat

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
in the second step we find sufficiently

276
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,600
many short vectors in the lattice

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
violet is reduction here that is this do

278
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
that is defined here

279
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
so we see that the lattice dimension

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
d is m plus n minus t one and the volume

281
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,200
of this value with high probability

282
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
in the next step we guess the last t1

283
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
positions

284
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,440
and

285
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
we also use new fft procedure to guess

286
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
velocity unknown positions we see that

287
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
we have redu for the exhaustive gas we

288
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
reduce the volume by q to t1 and for fft

289
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
gas will reduce the volume by gamma to t

290
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,839
one main reason that the designers

291
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,000
dismiss the do attacks

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
is

293
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
that they think it's hard to exploit

294
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,880
both the default game and the msv game

295
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,240
here we present a new two-step

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,079
lattice reduction framework to achieve

297
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
this both skins firstly in the first

298
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,040
step we do because reduction with size

299
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,839
beta and then we obtain a reduced basis

300
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,800
with a short vector b0 as a first

301
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
vector in the basis then we look at the

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
sub lattice l prime generated by the

303
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
first beta0 vectors in the reduced basis

304
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,360
and we perform receiving step

305
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
in this lattice and get the list of

306
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,200
short vectors of size this here this

307
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
lambda 1 l prime is the shortest vector

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,639
in this lattice l prime

309
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,680
but we know that in this lattice l prime

310
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,880
we already have a short vector beta 0 a

311
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
b 0 so this short shortest vector will

312
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
be will be no larger than

313
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,000
the size of b0 this value can be

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
concretely estimated by this issue could

315
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
work and also the time complexity of one

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
reduction can be estimated similar to

317
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,079
the message in the official documents of

318
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,720
crystals in this estimation receiving

319
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
costs are concretely estimated using

320
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
this h-equipped work for this we know

321
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,519
that this can be bounded by the

322
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,760
size of v0

323
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,920
on the other hand we can also use

324
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
gaussian heuristics to compute this

325
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,480
value these two estimations will lead to

326
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
very similar complex numbers

327
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
usually btc includes calling an svp

328
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
oracle for many times so we can see in

329
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
the second step with a larger dimension

330
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
to balance the cost so we have

331
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
beta0 is larger than beta prime means

332
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,279
that we have a few dimensions for three

333
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,680
in the second step so intuitively we

334
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,480
have

335
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,880
three dimensions in both steps the

336
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
default f gain can be estimated by two

337
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,800
models

338
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
the first model is firstly proposed by

339
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,160
ducas

340
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,120
using

341
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
asymptotics so this is a simple called

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
asymptotic model later albus at all

343
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,160
shows that g6 framework can achieve

344
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
larger dimension for free like a

345
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
technique called on the fly lifting

346
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
so we get an extrapolation model from

347
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
experimental data we will use both

348
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
models to study the concrete complexity

349
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
so now we can present the main

350
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,920
complexity theorem we see that the time

351
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
complexity of the new algorithm can be

352
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,880
estimated as c over p 0. we are pc with

353
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
the property that the partial secret is

354
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,519
one of the guest vectors you can see

355
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,240
that

356
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,800
c consists of two parts this part is

357
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,360
from lattice reduction and this part is

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
from gas and fft so we see that these

359
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
two these two parts are additive but

360
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
here guess and fft can reduce the volume

361
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,680
by a factor of q to t1

362
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
and

363
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
times gamma to t so this is uh why this

364
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
algorithm can outperform the previous

365
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,680
dual attacks here's the sample complex

366
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
as estimated by this formula and it's

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,040
gamma t times n

368
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
guess is

369
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,680
the number of hypotheses so this is from

370
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
this formula is from from information

371
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,759
theory for hypothesis testing we set c0

372
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
to be 4 which will be experimentally

373
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,800
verified later next i will introduce

374
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,519
applications of the new do algorithm so

375
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
first i will introduce applications to

376
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,880
crystals kyber we see that this table

377
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
shows the gate complexity comparison and

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
the cost is given in log 2 of operations

379
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
and here gamma is 2. which shows the

380
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,120
claim security levels and also it shows

381
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
the complexity numbers for the new do

382
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,880
lattice attacks in a symptotic d4f model

383
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
and in the gsyca d4f model we see that

384
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,800
the gains are generally big for instance

385
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,040
for kyber

386
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,680
1024 in the jessica model we achieve a

387
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,399
gain of almost 15 bits according to the

388
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,959
analysis we see that some schemes are

389
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,680
really on the edge and some schemes

390
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,399
offer a rather limited security margin

391
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,560
for kyber 768

392
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
in the jessica model we see that

393
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
this game has a two bits of security

394
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
loss similarly we see significant

395
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
improvements when applying the new

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
algorithm to secure parameters of

397
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
crystal stellissima

398
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
we see delicious mass 3 and the listener

399
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,320
5 offers

400
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,279
limited security margins we also apply

401
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,839
the new algorithm to solving some fhu

402
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,000
parameters this table shows a complex

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,079
comparison for the security parameters

404
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,519
in the homomorphic encryption

405
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
standardization draft aiming for

406
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,279
classical security

407
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
here n is 1024 and we choose gamma to v3

408
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
the secret distribution is a uniform

409
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
distribution from the set -1 0 and 1.

410
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
and the standard deviation of the noise

411
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
variable is 3.2 we see that we could

412
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,119
solve some parameter sets faster than

413
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
its claimed security level here the

414
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
justice d4f model is assumed we next

415
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
present experimental verification we

416
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,679
know the d4f king and the msv gain have

417
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
been extensively verified

418
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
so we mainly verify the data complexity

419
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
of the new fft distinguish we first

420
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
generate the samples in the queue of

421
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
this form

422
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
here each aig head was generated from a

423
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
discrete gaussian chi sigma one ej was

424
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
generated from another discrete gaussian

425
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,200
kai sigma 2. we set q to be

426
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,840
3329 and sr is generated from a uniform

427
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,880
distribution in z2 we implement the new

428
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
distinguisher to recover us with

429
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,480
dimension t this table shows our

430
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,640
experimental data we have two sets of

431
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,000
experiments

432
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,799
with different sigma 1 and sigma 2.

433
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,520
we pick t to be 8 12

434
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,039
and 16

435
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,080
respectively and we choose c 0 to be 4 2

436
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,039
1.

437
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,840
we compute the sample complexity via the

438
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
theoretical estimation and we test it 1

439
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
000 times for each each parameter then

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,320
we compute the success rate

441
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
we see that the theoretical estimation

442
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,679
is accurate and setting c0 to b4 can

443
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,640
ensure a high success probability in our

444
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
experiments the success rate is always

445
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,880
100

446
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
percent when c 0 is 4 meaning that

447
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
we succeeded 1 000 times in 1 000 tests

448
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,760
for a fixed c 0 the success probability

449
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
generally increased when tip became

450
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
larger we now conclude the work we have

451
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
proposed a faster due lattice attack

452
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,039
with two main novel contributions

453
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,000
firstly we proposed a new blation by a

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,120
style fft distinguisher that can reduce

455
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
the volume of the used to do lattice

456
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
secondly we proposed a new two-step

457
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,280
lattice reduction strategy allows us

458
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
allowing us to exploit both the d4-f

459
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
gain and the gain of one sieving

460
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,799
producing many sort vectors we applied

461
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,160
this new attack to crystals and often

462
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
significant gains in the ram model these

463
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,559
for instance these parameter sets or

464
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
either offer low very low security

465
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
margin or they are really on the latch

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
edge assuming for the g6f model we see

467
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
that kyber 768 has two bits of security

468
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,039
loss

469
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,760
with this new attack we can also solve

470
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
certain fhd parameters faster than the

471
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
claimed security levels in the ram model

472
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
actually this new attack

473
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,320
has very wide applications in

474
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,480
lattice-based crypto in the extended

475
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
version of the paper we applied the new

476
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,159
attack to n2 and obtained super sharp

477
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,799
results for these parameter sets so this

478
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,960
parameter set claim 209 bits of security

479
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
in the ram model means that they can

480
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
only offer two bits of security margin

481
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
regarding the primal attacks our new do

482
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
attack can

483
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
reduce 8 to 10 bits further depending on

484
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,120
the selected d4f model so the complex

485
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,799
number is estimated to be about 200 bits

486
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
meaning that this parameter set is below

487
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,200
the security level of nist 3 in the both

488
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,320
d4f models thank you for your attention
