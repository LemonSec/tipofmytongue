hello everyone i'm shandong i'm talking

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,279
about automatic classical and quantum

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,679
rebound attack on esl hashing by

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,320
exploring the relative k differentials

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
analysis we already have two

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,679
models there are q1 q2 model in q1 model

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,119
that attackers

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,760
can make only cluster queries and use

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,040
the quantum computer to perform the tag

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,000
in q2 model the attackers are allowed to

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
make quantum

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
queries for block cipher q1 model is

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
more practical than q2 model but for

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,719
hash function

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
we are ready to make

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
quantum superposition queries

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
on quantum clean attacks we house

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
regenerate algorithm summarized by

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
hosumata

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
and sasaki the first divine the phd

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
algorithm it needs

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
very large quantum random access memory

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
it achieves optimal

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
when the size of qram is 2 2 and device

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
3 the second one is the parallel row

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
algorithm it doesn't need qram the third

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
one is cns algorithm

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
it outperforms the birthday attack when

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
we have large classical memory

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,439
in quantum computation we can make

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,240
superposition queries with a quantum

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,920
oracle for example uf acts on a

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
superposition and output

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
a superposition grower's algorithm is a

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
quantum search

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,439
method to achieve a square root speed up

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,640
then

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,079
classical search

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
this paper is for focusing on aes like

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
hashing it's built on

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,159
uh pledging aes like cipher sub

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
permutations into the famous pgv models

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
such as

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,679
dm mmo and mp modes

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,879
on clear attack we have three settings

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
the first one is the standard clearance

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,959
it used the standard

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,840
initial vector av to fan the equilibrium

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,040
pair m and m

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,879
the second one is the semi-phrase that

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
clearance is uses

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
a different initial vector

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,599
the third one is a freestyle clearance

57
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
it used a

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,400
higher or initial vectors

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
in aes like hashing the setting of the

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,480
freestyle clearing allows the attackers

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
to make

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
to use the degrees of freedom from the

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
key it should be noted that in mug

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
diagrams

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
security reduction all the three

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,920
types of client should be avoided

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
attack is the basic message to build a

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
clean attacks on as luck hashing it is

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159

spaces

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
they are in one phase and outbound phase

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,799
in the inbound phase emitting the middle

approach

76
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,680
uh is applied to generate the pair

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
confirming the inbound trill with very

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
cheap cost

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,840
those pairs are named as that poise

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,159
in the outbound phase the attackers

81
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
verifies or function a differential

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519

in classical

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
clearing attacks we have to transverse

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
at least one divide pr starting points

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,879
to possibly find a plane to be better

90
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,280
than burst attack pr should be larger

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,000

i discovered that in quantum sighting

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
one can use the grower's algorithm to

one divides pr means to be better than

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
generic quantum clearing attacks

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
pr can be significantly

105
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,680
lower than

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
that in classical setting for example to

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
be better than bhc algorithm pr should

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
be larger than this bit number

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
this number

110
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
to be better than rules algorithm

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
pr should be

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
larger than

2 2 minus n

114
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
to extend the rebounded text jaylbart

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
and like lamberg

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,160
proposed

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
the super xbox technique to build a two

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,639
rung inbound phase later the circuit

119
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
at all introduced the nan full active

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
supers box to reduce the memory cost

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
in continent setting these two kind of

122
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
supers box technique

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,400
is converted into quantum one

[Music]

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
jing at all introduce the three rounds

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
in one phase

128
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
uh later

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
cosy mother and sataki also converted

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
into a quantum one

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
to adopt

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
related k differential in the ribbon

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
attack

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
there are three steps first to find the

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,800
relative chocolate differential for ek

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,759
second choose a k pair okay

137
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
that means the differential of k

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
schedule sir perform the rebound attack

139
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,400
with k-pair

140
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
to find a good relative k differential

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
we first consider previous tools in

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,440
single case setting look at example 1 by

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,240
enumerating the cancellations of mc and

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
ak

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,479
we can estimate the probability however

146
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
we have different situations for

147
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,280
relative case setting for example

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,880
in figure b

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
when only numerating the

150
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,520
cancellations the probability is 2 2

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,199
minus 2 c

152
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,319
however there is only one active x box

153
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,960
we can choose a valid differential from

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,360
x i to y i by accessing the dto's xbox

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
and then choose a k to cancel the two

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,039
cells

157
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,199
difference in w i

158
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
the total probability of the trio will

159
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,919
only around 2 2

160
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,120
minus c

161
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
larger than before

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
so by consuming the degrees of freedom

163
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,599
from the k the probability of the

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
differential may increase

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
we introduce some symbols as a

166
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
constraints to calculate the probability

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
of the relative

168
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,240
k differential

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
the consumed degrees of freedom in k

170
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,840
should be no more than the

171
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
cases we have different objective

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
function

173
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
by assigning two running one phase or

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,799
three running boundaries

175
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
when applying to safari we have to deal

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
with the incapabilities within many runs

177
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
due to the very easy case schedule

178
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,560
for example we can deduce two equal

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
equations

180
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,039
regarding to mr operations

181
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,720
by adding them together we find that

182
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
we find the base country contradiction

183
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,360
we use property property of mds metrics

184
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
to fast filter the impossible solutions

185
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
derived about

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
our mlp model that is if there are at

187
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,919
least four theme files in the

188
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,440
two input output vector or mc or other

189
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,719
cells should be the same

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,320
for example in finger a we use the inner

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
product of s and s g to calculate the

192
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,039
number of sim cells it is 4 in finger a

193
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
so all the differences in y and y g

194
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
should be the same however they are

195
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,440
different so we see the contradiction

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,279
thing b shows a possible case

197
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,440
with

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,640
mrp model we found an add-on relief

199
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,200
decay differential trial

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
the inbound phase cover two runs the

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,360
probability of the outbound phase is 2 2

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
minus

203
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,680
2 one one

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
we give a quantum phrase.clear attack on

205
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
eight wrong saturate with time capacity

206
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,959
to

207
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,760
uh

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
to one two two

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
we also found a night wrong trial for

210
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
also standard harsh

211
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
whipple different from previous

212
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,959
812 the ribbon attacks happen

213
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
in both the case schedule path and data

214
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,080
encryption path

215
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
the trio is given here

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
to perform the quantum attack we first

217
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
prepare some functions

218
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,279
g is a function to compute the three

219
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
rung inbound phase

220
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
f is the uh is to mark the right key

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,519
pair that confirming the

222
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,320
differential trial or the k scalar path

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
then run growth algorithm on f one can

224
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
find bandage

225
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
part f

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,680
is to mark a

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,560
omega-6 that leads to a client or not

228
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
by calling the functions defined before

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
we run algorithms

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
grow algorithms on uf to find a client

231
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,000
these are the summaries of our text

232
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,720
for verbal and set rehash

233
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,959
thank you
