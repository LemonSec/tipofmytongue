00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,080
hi

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
my name is kenji azella

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,040
this talk is about a new framework of

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
bit security

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,840
this is a joint work with shungwatanabe

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,840
in this talk we want to consider what is

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,480
speech security

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
it is in some sense a well established

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
measure of controlling the security

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
level of cryptographic primitives

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,719
we say

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
primitive p has kv to security

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,719
if

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,200
every adversary needs to describe

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
operations to break p

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
so the question is

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
how can we define bit security

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
as an example

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,640
let's consider the case of value

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,879
function

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,640
let f be a function

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,280
we say an adversary breaks

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
atmospheric a breaks one minus of f

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
if

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
given a sample f of x

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
a ups up to output the string y

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,680
satisfy f of x is equal to f of y

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
we can't do we want to consider the

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
computational cost needed to break one

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
minus

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
we have two simple solutions

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
the first one is the bluetooth search

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
for every string y

34
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,560
the algorithm checks if f of x is equal

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
to f of y

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
until it finds the solution

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
the second one is random guessing

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
for random string y

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,159
the algorithm checks if f of x is equal

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
to f of y they always iterates the

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,200
procedure until it finds the solution

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
in either case

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
the algorithm needs

44
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,399
order

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,399
of two n iterations to find the solution

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,080
so the total competition cost is for the

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,720
t f times to gn

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
where tf is the

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,720
cost for evaluating the function a

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
and

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
we may have another solution

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
normally

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
there is some good algorithm a with

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
computational complexity t

55
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,160
such that a breaks the runways with

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
probability equation

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
in this case

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
let's consider what if we invoke the

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
always in total end times

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
the probability

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
that

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,040
some always breaks one ways will be

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,799
amplified to episode n

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,239
since it is sufficient to choose n is

65
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
equal to 1 over epsilon

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,840
so the total computational cost

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
of order n times t is equal to order t

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,760
over epsilon

69
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
we have seen three solutions to estimate

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
the cost of breaking one awareness

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
we notice that

72
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
the cost of quantity over epsilon is

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,319
consistent in all solutions

74
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
in the proof readable search

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
the cost is tf times to the n and

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
epsilon is equal to one

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,120
when we use random guessing cost is just

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
t f

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
and the equation is equal to 2 to the

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
minus n

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
so

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
based on this observation

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
the bit security should be defined as

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
the minimum value of the

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
log base 2 of key over episode

86
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
and this way of

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,319
defining with security can be extended

88
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,959
to other structural primitives such as

89
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,560
signature schemes and the message of

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
this course and

91
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
there's also the

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
such type of assumptions such as

93
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,079
factoring

94
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,400
their problem and cgh assumption

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
so the question we want to ask in this

96
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
work is

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
how to define bit scale of decision type

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
premium debits and assumptions

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,199
such as pseudorandom judges action

100
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
schemes and ddgt assumptions

101
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
in decision game the

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
adversary's winning probability is

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
designed to be close to one-half

104
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,960
so

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
we usually define the advantage of the

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
adversary as

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
two times the absolute value of the

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
winning probability minus

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
one-half

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,759
so we want to know this advantage is the

111
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
right measure for operating bit security

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
in this

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
work

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
we introduced a new framework for

115
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
defining bit security

116
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
it is defined for security games

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
and we apply the same operational

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
meaning for such and decision games

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
the interpretation is that game g has

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
cabbage security

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
if every attacker needs computational

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
cost up to this k

123
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,280
for winning the game with high

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
probability

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
since we consider that two types of

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
search and vision games should be

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
structurally different

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
we define the winning concern for the

129
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,198
two types differently

130
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
and as an answer to the second question

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
in the previous slide

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
we showed that in your framework the

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
learning the advantage is the right

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,039
measure

135
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
for evaluating with security of decision

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
games

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
and we show several natural reduction of

138
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
each security between security games

139
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
and finally we compare our framework

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,720
with

141
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
one proposed by each and every

142
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,159
underwater in 2018

143
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,318
now we discover our framework

144
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
there are two adversaries in your

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
adversary and an outer adversary

146
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
the inner adversary plays the user

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
security game ge

148
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
which is an interaction between

149
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
adversary and challenge

150
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,319
we assume that for every game a

151
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
transaction is a random secret u of

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
length n

153
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
for such games we usually require that

154
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
the adversary winning probability should

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,360
be crossed to zero

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
for this stream games

157
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
the secret is just a beat

158
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,080
and the winning condition is to predict

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,719
the big u

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
in this case the winning probability is

161
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,560
designed to be close to one half

162
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,479
and the task of the outer advisor is to

163
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,919
invoke local game g many times to

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,758
amplifies the winning probability

165
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,680
next we will define the winning concern

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
for the outer adversary

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
first consider the case of the search

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
game

169
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
the outdoor adversary collects

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,080
information from the inner adversaries

171
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,280
here we assume that each

172
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
adversary presents independent game with

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,440
fresh randomness ui

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
the winning condition of the

175
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,840
outdoor adventure is that there is some

176
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,280
inadequacy who wins the local game

177
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
so the task of their adult adversaries

178
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
to invoke in advances sufficiently main

179
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
times

180
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
so that some inaudible wins the local

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
gay

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,159
next consider the case of the decision

183
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
game

184
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
we assume that

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
each inadvertently present independent

186
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,839
game with consistent secret secret bit

187
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
u namely a secret beat you is injury

188
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
sampled and the same secret is used in

189
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,199
each local game

190
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
after collecting information from the

191
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
adversaries

192
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,800
the ultra adversary finally outputs

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
his prediction you prime

194
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
the winning condition is that the

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
projection is equal to you

196
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
so the task of the iterative adversary

197
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
is to invoke

198
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
inner adversaries many times until he

199
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,399
can grab sufficient information to

200
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,040
predict you

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,519
in our framework the split security is

202
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
defined as the

203
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
minimum value of the log base 2 of n

204
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,360
times t

205
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
where n is the number of implications by

206
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
the other adversity and this is the

207
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
computational cost of conducting the

208
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
local game

209
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
the minimum is taken over all inner and

210
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,480
outer adversaries with restriction that

211
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
the other adversary wins the game with

212
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
gravity at least one minus mu

213
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,440
where mu is some small constant called

214
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
the error probability

215
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
this formulation means that the bit

216
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
security is the log of the total

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
computational cost needed to achieve the

218
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
winning probability at least one minus

219
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
mu

220
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,319
we have several implications

221
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
first for such games

222
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
the bit security must take a finite

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,200
value

224
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
the reason is that if the output length

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
of the adversary is m

226
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,959
a random guessing adversary can win the

227
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,880
game with probability at least two to

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
the minus m

229
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
so the total cost of

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
of to this m is sufficient to win the

231
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
game with high probability

232
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,760
so the security is at the most m

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
in contrast

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
addition game may have new finite bit

235
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
security

236
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
we can understand it by considering the

237
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
one-time path encryption or perfectly

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
secure encryption schemes

239
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
since no adversary can increase the

240
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
advantage in

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
this indicativity game

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
we cannot amplify the winning

243
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
probability to

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
one minus mu

245
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
so the

246
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,320
security is important

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
finally we observe that

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
in the decision gain the output

249
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
adversary collects samples from inner

250
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
adversaries to

251
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
distinguish two cases

252
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
this is the task called binary

253
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,079
hypothesis testing in information theory

254
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
or statistics

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
so we can use the existing knowledge

256
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
from the literature to characterize this

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
task

258
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
we characterize our big security in the

259
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,040
following serum

260
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
for any security engine the bit security

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
is equal to the minimum value of the log

262
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
base 2 of t over the advantage of the

263
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,639
inner person

264
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
namely we can exclude the outer

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
adversary and the bit of security can be

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
avoided by the by the inner adversary

267
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
where the advantage is defined as flows

268
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320
for such games it is equal to the

269
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
winning probability of the adversity

270
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,079
which is

271
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
we can easily understand

272
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,959
for additional gains the advantage is

273
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,839
called the learning advantage which is

274
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
equal to the grainy divergence of order

275
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
one half between two distributions at

276
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
zero and a one

277
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
where a u is the absolute distribution

278
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
of the in adversary under the concern

279
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,800
that you was chosen as a secret

280
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
we investigate the behavior of the

281
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
learning advantage by comparing it with

282
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
the conventional advantage

283
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,240
suppose that the wind probability of the

284
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
the adversary is equal to

285
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
one plus epsilon over two

286
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
then the conventional advantage is go to

287
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
episode

288
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,000
the many advantages given us in the

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,959
previous slide and we showed that

290
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
for an additional gain

291
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
the granny advantage is bounded to below

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
by friction squared and is bounded about

293
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
by division

294
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
we showed that

295
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
the length of the ring advantage is

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
equal to the lower bound of balanced

297
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,880
adversaries

298
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,079
where we say an adversary is balanced if

299
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
it attracts any value with at least

300
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
constant probability

301
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,199
using this

302
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,480
proposition we can resolve a peculiar

303
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
problem of linear tests for

304
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,240
pseudonymogenesis

305
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,240
let's look at this problem

306
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
considering sudden genetic g with c

307
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,000
language n

308
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,279
it is known that for any pseudo-random

309
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,399
generators

310
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,120
there exists a linear test t

311
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
that achieves the conventional advantage

312
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
of two to the minus n over two

313
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
since none non-trivial linear tests are

314
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
to zero and one with equal probability

315
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,360
they are balanced

316
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
thus

317
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,279
the learning advantage will be two to

318
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,440
the minus n

319
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
from the previous

320
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,359
proposition

321
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
so if the bit security is equal to

322
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,800
log base 2

323
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
of t over the conventional advantage

324
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
the bit security must be at most annual

325
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,959
too

326
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,320
however it is counterintuitive because

327
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,079
it still seems unnatural that nbc's

328
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
pseudonym generator must have been

329
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
security at the most in order 2.

330
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
in our frame bank

331
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
since the bit security is characterized

332
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
by the by the learning advantage

333
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,440
it is possible to achieve enemy security

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,959
and

335
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,759
we note that the measurement underwater

336
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,639
also resolves this problem by the

337
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,920
framework in a different way

338
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
and in our framework we show several

339
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,639
natural bridge security reductions

340
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
uh kbit secure pseudonymous data implies

341
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
the cape to secure one function

342
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,040
and kept secure in the cpa encryption

343
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
schemes implies the kept secure one cpa

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
action scheme

345
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
also the capital security division

346
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,759
assumption implies cable security's

347
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,759
assumption

348
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
and regarding the gold right here vaping

349
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,480
theorem

350
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
we showed that

351
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
kept secure one function implies a cable

352
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
secure hardcore predicate for balanced

353
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
adversaries

354
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
however proving the general case remains

355
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
up

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
for the distribution approximation

357
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,120
problem

358
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
we show a natural composition of bit

359
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
security

360
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,800
suppose that

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,839
game g

362
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,160
employing distribution q has kept

363
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,440
security

364
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
and support that two distributions p and

365
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
q

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,360
are kept securing this in this schedule

367
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
then we showed that

368
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,319
game g employing distribution p instead

369
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,280
of q

370
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,599
is kept secure

371
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
and this relation holds both in search

372
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,799
and decision gains

373
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
we believe briefly sees that which

374
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,679
security framework proposed by

375
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
mechanical order

376
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,039
then you find your bit security as the

377
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,480
log test

378
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,520
of

379
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
t over some advantage introduced in

380
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,799
their paper

381
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
it is defined using the mutual

382
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,919
information and the channel entropy of

383
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,480
random variables x and y

384
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
where x is the random secret of the game

385
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
as in our framework

386
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,799
and y is defined as force

387
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
it is according to the various symbol

388
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
board if the adversary adds volt

389
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
and it is equal to x

390
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
if the other battery wins again

391
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,520
and in other cases

392
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
y is chosen informally at random under

393
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,799
the function that it is not equal to x

394
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
this advantage captures some

395
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,120
correlations between x and y

396
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,600
however it is difficult to understand

397
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,879
what it means in this form

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,799
after introducing the advantages they

399
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,320
showed that

400
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
that advantage can be approximated as

401
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
force

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
for such games

403
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,960
as in our framework it is

404
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
the winning probability of the adversity

405
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
for additional gains it is equal to

406
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520
alpha a times the square of 2 beta a

407
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,559
minus 1 where ryan is a probability that

408
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
value as a sample

409
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
and

410
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,200
that a is a conditional property that a

411
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
wins a game g

412
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,760
and function that a after the value as a

413
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,760
support

414
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
by this characterization we can see that

415
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
if the conventional advantages in

416
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,240
decision gain is at the most minus k

417
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,440
over 2 for every adversary

418
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
then the game has cable to secure

419
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
also in their framework the classical

420
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
correlation level theorem gives a title

421
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
reduction

422
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
namely capture secure one function

423
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
implies cable to secure hardcore

424
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,678
predictor

425
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
compared to their results

426
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
the difference from our framework are as

427
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
follows

428
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
first our notion has an

429
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,720
operational meaning

430
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
second

431
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,880
if

432
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
the commission advantage at most to this

433
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,679
minus k over 2

434
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
then it does not imply that it has kept

435
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
security

436
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
in our framework the bit security lies

437
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,840
between

438
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,199
k over 2 and k

439
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
also following the tightness of the

440
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,799
correlation term

441
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,520
to

442
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,159
prove it we need to improve reduction

443
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,559
always

444
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
we conclude our talk

445
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,679
we introduced a security framework with

446
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,760
operational meaning

447
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,720
the interpretation in that game g

448
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
has kept security if every attacker

449
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
needs a computational cost of to decay

450
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,799
or within the game with high probability

451
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,240
we show that

452
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,799
in our framework the lenny advantage is

453
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
a large measure of operating bit

454
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
security

455
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,760
a possible future work is to give a

456
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
tight reduction of the global healing

457
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,559
theorem

458
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,799
since we have several frameworks to

459
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
evaluate speech security

460
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
people may wonder which notions should

461
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
be employed

462
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
so it may beneficial to discuss the

463
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
measure for shaping the bit security

464
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,039
notion

465
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,000
for example building some actions orbit

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
security may because

467
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,320
that's all

468
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,559
thank you
