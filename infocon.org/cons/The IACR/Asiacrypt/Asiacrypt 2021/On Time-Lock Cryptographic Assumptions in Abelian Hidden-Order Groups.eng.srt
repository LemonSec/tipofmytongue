00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,679
welcome to the asia crypt 2021 recorded

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,759
talk of our work on time log

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,600
cryptographic assumptions in a billion

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
hidden order groups my name is adam

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,759
comparison and this is a joint work with

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,679
mark staplets

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
what are hidden order groups a ignored

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
group is a finite group g such that it

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
is hard to compute a multiple of the

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,000
order of the group and preferably we can

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
sample these groups without the need for

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,480
a trusted setup

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
perhaps the most well-known examples of

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
hidden order groups are rsa groups and

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
imaginary quadratic class groups

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,280
in an rsa group computing a multiple of

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
the order is equivalent to the problem

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
of factoring the modulus n

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
which is believed to be a hard problem

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
and the fastest non-classical method is

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
the general number field shift

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,160
on the other hand imaginary quadratic

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
class groups are historically less

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
studied compared to rsa groups and the

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
problem of computing a multiple of the

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
order does not reduce to some

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
well-studied computational problem

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,199
the fastest known classical method of

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
computing the order is the multiple

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
polynomial quadratic shape

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
one positive aspect of imaginary

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
quadratic class groups is that they do

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,240
not need a trusted setup whereas rsa

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
groups do need a trusted setup

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
some applications of hidden order groups

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,840
are verifiable delays functions and

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
dialog cryptographic instructions build

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,720
upon verifiable delay functions recently

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
it has been shown that

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
verify the delay functions can be built

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,799
based on the hardness of computing x to

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
the power 2 to the power t for a random

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
element of the group g

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
with less than d sequential operations

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,240
however if the order of the group is

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,759
known

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
we can reduce this exponent due to the

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
priority modulo the group order and can

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
compute this explanation exponentiation

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,119
and cost logarithmic in the group order

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
so for these are called lay functions we

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,159
need the group order to be hidden

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,600
moreover

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
if the order of a group is known it's

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,439
easy to compute

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,399
eat roots where when e is co-primed to

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,919
the group order

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,640
and this can be done simply by inverting

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
e while you load the order of the group

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
and raising the element x to the power d

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
where d is the modular inverse of

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
this relates to the hardness of the eat

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
root problem the strong root problem and

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
the adaptive root problem in rsa groups

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
the e root problem is related to the rsa

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,519
problem and the strong root problem is

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,640
related to the strong rsa problem

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
these assumptions are important for

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
cryptographic accumulators serial

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
knowledge arguments and video and the

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
soundness of the pdf constructions that

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
i discussed above

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
one thing to note is that

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,519
these reductions hold up analogously if

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
only a multiple of the group order is

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,760
known

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
since this work focus on abelian hidden

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
order groups we want to stress some of

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
the difference between cyclic and

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,519
abelian groups

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
of a group is a billion if its group

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
action is commuted

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,040
uh a sick a group is cyclic if there is

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
a single element that generates the

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,680
entire

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
and more precisely for a cyclic group

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
and and the order of this group there

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
are five n

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
such generators for f is the euler phi

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
function and so a single uniformly

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
random element is going to be a

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
generator with probability phi n over n

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
if the order of the group is

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
is prime p

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,040
then this uniformly sampled element is

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,959
going to be a generator with probability

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
one minus one over p which is very close

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
to one if the is a large point on the

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
other hand in the abelian setting

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,360
there exists multiple elements such that

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
the group is generated by these elements

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
since we are dealing with a finite group

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
and this holds for n the number of

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
elements need to generate the group

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
equal to the logarithm of the group

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,439
order but often a smaller n is going to

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,840
be sufficient moreover it can be shown

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,080
that two n uniformly random elements

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
generate the group with probability at

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,840
least one minus one over

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,920
n so why do we specifically study

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,399
abelian hidden or groups in this work

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
going back to the example of rsa groups

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
we see that if we pick two safe primes b

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
and q then the subgroup of quadratic

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
residues in this rsa group has composite

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
order and is going to be cyclic so if we

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
pick a random element in the rsa group

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
then the square of this element is going

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
to be a generator of the

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
residue subgroup with overwhelming

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
probability however as i mentioned

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
before rsa groups require trusted setup

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
this is because we need the primes b and

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
q to generate the modulus and to be able

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
to work in a group but afterwards we

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
want to forget these primes b and q

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,639
because the order of the group needs to

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,919
be hidden

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
in order for

131
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
some hidden order group assumptions to

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,919
hold

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
imaginary quadratic class groups on the

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
other hand can be big it can be sampled

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
without a trusted setup by picking a

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
random fundamental discriminant

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,360
and

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
knowing this discriminant does not leak

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
any information about the group order

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
except for its parity

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
and we can even pick the discriminant in

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
such a way that the class group is

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
always that the order of the class group

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
is always going to be odd and still that

145
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
the discriminant does not leak any

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,440
information about the group order

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
however class groups are also going to

148
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
be cyclic with high probability by the

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
coin lens triggeristics

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
but sampling a random class group we

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
have no efficient way to check if it is

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
cyclic

153
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,039
so this motivates the study of

154
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
non-cyclic abelian hidden order groups

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
in historically non-cyclic groups

156
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
received far less attention in

157
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
cryptologic research compared to cyclic

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
groups so this motivated

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
our work and the needs for new methods

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,380
to be developed

161
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,800
[Music]

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
one main goal of this work is to study

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
and define the abelian hidden order

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
group setting to do this we

165
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
defined this abelian hidden order

166
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
standard model which is just the normal

167
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,960
standard model but in the definition of

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
our games a random group is sampled from

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,440
some large group family and n random

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,759
group elements are sampled

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
to act as generators

172
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,319
moreover we

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,600
propose

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
the billion hidden order algebra group

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
model as a generalization of the

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
algebraic group model where adversaries

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,400
need to provide an algebraic relation

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
for every output group element

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
and moreover just this individual hidden

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
order standard model

181
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,560
at first range receive an explicit group

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
description and a random set of

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
generators in their input

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,479
we also

185
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,479
generalize the strong algebraic group

186
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
model to the building hidden order

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,080
setting

188
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
the strong algebra group model is

189
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
similar to the algebraic group model but

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
here adversaries have many other

191
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,720
backgrounds in which

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
they have to output a representation of

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
the output group elements in terms of

194
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
some elementary algebraic relations

195
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,800
which i'll explain more about later

196
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
and just as in the above two models the

197
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
adversaries receive some explicit group

198
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,440
description and a random set of

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
generators as during

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
we adapted the definitions of

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
cryptographic problems to debut it in an

202
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
order setting to be able to study them

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
since often

204
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,479
cryptographic problems either

205
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
depend explicitly on the order being

206
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
known or are explicitly defined for

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
either cyclic groups or circular groups

208
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
of prime order for instance

209
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
finally we study relations between

210
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
cryptographic problems and obedient

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
billion groups within order in these

212
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
three

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,039
newly generalized models

214
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
so which cryptographic problems do we

215
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,759
study in our work first of all we study

216
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,280
the multiple order and hidden order

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
problem which are simply the problems of

218
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,479
computing

219
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
either the exact group order or a

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
multiple of the reporting

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
moreover the low order problem which is

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
the problem of finding a non-trivial

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,840
element

224
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,039
in the group which has low order

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
and the eat root problem which is the

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
problem of computing an eat root of a

227
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
random element x which is sampled from

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
the subgroup of 8 powers the strong root

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
problem which is the problem of finding

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
a non-trivial root of some random group

231
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
element

232
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
the adaptive root problem which is the

233
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,399
problem of finding a prime root for an

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
element of the adversary's choice

235
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
where the random prime exponent is

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
sampled after the adversary picks the

237
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,680
group element

238
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
the repeated squaring problem which is

239
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
the problem of computing x to the power

240
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
2 to the power of t

241
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
faster than t squaring for a random

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
group element

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,120
the deal of one

244
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
problem which is the generalization of

245
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
the normal discrete logarithm problem to

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
the setting where we have multiple

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
generators so it's a problem of giving a

248
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
representation of a random group element

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
x in terms of some generators g1 up to g

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
n

251
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
we study the d log 2 problem which is

252
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
just the

253
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,040
regular cyclic discrete logarithm

254
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
problem but now in random cyclic

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
subgroups of this abelian group

256
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,839
g

257
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
and sim and similarly the cdh2 problem

258
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
which is the computational

259
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
diffie-hellman problem in

260
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
again random cyclic subgroups of this

261
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,730
abelian group

262
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,940
[Music]

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
in this diagram we see an overview of

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
the reductions that we prove in our work

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
the green cells are stand for new

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
results or new reductions in either the

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
standard model algebra group model or

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,839
the strong algebraic model the yellow

269
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,560
cells then for partial results

270
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
are either for these reductions from the

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
e root problems

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
we need the condition that e is

273
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
co-primed with the group order or for

274
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,959
this reduction from the low order

275
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,440
problem we need to condition that and

276
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
there is some oracle which provides us

277
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
with a small prime subdivisor of the

278
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
group order with non-negligible

279
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,279
probability

280
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,480
the red cells stand for that there is no

281
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,440
generic reduction possible from

282
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
this problem to the other problem and

283
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
these mostly follow from the

284
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
impossibility results for

285
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
a generic computation of discrete

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,279
logarithms

287
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,839
which is proven by shupe in 1997.

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
the other hand we see that most of the

289
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,959
results most of the new results we

290
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,000
proved

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
are reductions from the multiple order

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
problem to

293
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
almost all of the other problems that we

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
consider in this work

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
composing these

296
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
new reductions with no reductions from

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
for instance the repeated squaring

298
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
problem to the multiple order problem

299
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,480
the strong root bond to the multiple

300
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
order problem

301
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
and the adaptive rebound to the multiple

302
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,720
order problem we obtain this whole

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,519
green block of problems which are

304
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,320
equivalent to the multiple order problem

305
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,079
in either the

306
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,120
algebra group model or the

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
strongholds barcode mode

308
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
in terms of related work dungard and

309
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
comprisedly proved in 2002 the hardness

310
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
of the strong root problem and the

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
e-root problem in the generic group

312
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,160
model and they also considered these

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
problems in the hidden order setting

314
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,839
where they sampled the random group

315
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
according to some

316
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,920
hard group family but however since

317
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
their results are in the generic group

318
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
model the techniques they use are mostly

319
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
incomparable to the

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
are fully incomparable to the techniques

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
that we use in this work

322
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
god's loss and q

323
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,760
showed in 2020 and that the hardness of

324
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
factoring implies the hardness of the

325
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
repeated squaring problem in rsa groups

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
in the strong algebraic group model and

327
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,639
it was also in this work that they

328
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
introduced the stronghold square group

329
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
model as sort of the right model to

330
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
consider

331
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
this repeated current

332
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
and

333
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,000
looking a little bit more closely at

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
their result

335
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
we can see that there is a

336
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,519
straightforward generalization of their

337
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
reduction to reduction of the multiple

338
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,519
order problem to the repeated squaring

339
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
problem for cyclic groups

340
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,720
and this coincides with the results for

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
rsa groups since factoring is equivalent

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
to the hidden order problem which is

343
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
equivalent to the multiple order problem

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,650
for rsa groups specifically

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
finally rotam segev and shahad and rotom

347
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
and segev prove that delay functions

348
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,519
require hidden order groups in a generic

349
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,720
group model for cyclic groups and

350
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
that generically speeding up repeated

351
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,600
squaring in rsa groups is equivalent to

352
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,560
factoring in the generic ring model

353
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
again since these results are in the

354
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
generic group model and the generic ring

355
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
model

356
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
the methods they use are incomparable to

357
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,310
ours

359

the alderweire group model was

360
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,519
introduced by phukeswara guilds and laws

361
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
in 2018 and it's defined as follows an

362
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
attorney is called algebraic for all of

363
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
the group elements that it outputs it

364
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
also outputs some representation such

365
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
that it says output group element x can

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
be written as a product of input group

367
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
elements to the power of these

representation coefficients

369
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,399
originally in in the original paper

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,240
the algebraic group model is introduced

371
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
for cyclic groups of known prime order

372
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,680
and they consider games where an

373
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
anniversary receives

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
a description of group g

375
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
of a cyclic group g together with some

376
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,519
generator and the prime order p

377
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,560
and

378
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
most of the time this group generator

379
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
and order were fixed

380
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
we uh generalized this to the abelian

381
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,199
setting

382
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,000
for groups of unknown order um as

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,839
follows

384
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,079
at the start of a game g an adversary

385
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,959
receives a group randomly drawn from

386
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,240
some group family together with

387
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
n random elements which will generate

388
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
the group with overwhelming probability

389
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,319
by assuming that this n is large enough

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,760
the strong algebraic group model was

391
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
introduced by cuts loss and q

392
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,959
in 2020 and it's fine as follows and its

393
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
first three is called strongly algebraic

394
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
if it has one or more output rounds in

395
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,959
which for each of the elements that it

396
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,920
outputs in is found it also outputs some

397
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
sort of elementary representation of

398
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
this element in this elementary

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,160
representation is either

400
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
a representation is x of a product x1

401
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
times x2 or

402
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,600
a representation of x as x1 inverse

403
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,079
where x1 and x2 are elements that the

404
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,720
adversary either receives in an earlier

405
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
round or computed itself in an earlier

406
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
round

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
originally this

408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
model was introduced for cyclic groups

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,279
of

410
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
unknown semi-prime order as i said

411
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
before for

412
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
rsa groups and so in a computational

413
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,360
game g an adversary receives

414
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
the modulus and

415
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,079
where this module is just sampled from

416
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,639
some modulus generating algorithm and um

417
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,320
then that gives the adversary the

418
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,120
ability to work in this um

419
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
rsa group

420
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,160
we generalized this model to obedient

421
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
groups arbitrary unknown order

422
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
in the same way as we did for the agm

423
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,920
such that an adversary at the start of a

424
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,240
game receives a random group transforms

425
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
a group family and a random set of

426
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
elements which will generate the group

427
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
with overwhelming probability

428
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
since most of the reductions that we

429
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
prove in this work are reductions from

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
the problem of computing a multiple of

431
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
the group order to some other

432
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
computational problem i will for the

433
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
rest of this presentation mostly focus

434
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,680
on the main steps that

435
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
we took in proving these reductions and

436
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
the main ingredient in these reductions

437
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
is the concept of relations and

438
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120
relations are an important concept

439
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
in for instance order computation

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,959
algorithms for

441
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
finite billion groups so if we have a

442
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
find the billion group g with some

443
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
system of generators

444
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,959
g1 up till gn

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,079
then a vector e1 up to en out of the

446
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
integers

447
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
is called a relation for the system of

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,199
generators

449
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,000
if

450
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,919
um raising its generator to the power

451
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
e so g1 to the power en times g2 to the

452
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
power e2 all the way up to gn to the bar

453
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
en multiplies out to the identity in the

454
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
group

455
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
then we call such a vector a relation

456
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
and the relation for a system of

457
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,799
generators for an integer lattice which

458
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,640
we call the relationship lattice

459
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
so simplest

460
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
um example of this is how a d log one

461
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,039
adversary naturally gives rise to

462
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,760
relations so if we sample a random group

463
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
element with some known representation

464
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
with respect to this system of

465
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
generators and we query the d log

466
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
adversary on

467
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,799
this system of generators and this

468
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
randomly sampled element

469
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,679
then if this adversity is successful

470
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
then we can just take our representation

471
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,480
of this group element and subtract the

472
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
answer of the adversary from this and in

473
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,200
this way obtain a relation with respect

474
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,799
to this system of generators

475
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
relationship lattice for a given system

476
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
of generators can also be seen as the

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
kernel of the search active morphism

478
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
which maps from z to the power n to the

479
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
group g this is vector e to g to the

480
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,080
power e

481
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
then if b is a basis for the

482
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
relationship lattice then we see in this

483
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
way that set n

484
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
modeled out by this basis time set to

485
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,039
the power n is isomorphic to the group g

486
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
and in particular that the determinant

487
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
of this um of this basis of the lattice

488
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
is going to be equal to the order of the

489
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,919
group

490
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
even more is true and for the from the

491
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
spin normal form of this basis

492
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,240
one can obtain generators h1 up to hk of

493
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,960
the group which have order n1 up to nk

494
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,440
such that we can write g as a direct

495
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
product of the cyclic subgroups

496
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
generated by these generators h1 up to

497
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,000
hk and such that n1 divides n2 to fights

498
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,160
and etc all the way up to mk so we get

499
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
from the spin normal form of this

500
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
relation lattice

501
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,720
the decomposition of the civilian group

502
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
in terms of its invariance

503
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,640
so this gives us the idea

504
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
to obtain relations from an adversary

505
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,919
solving a given computational problem

506
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,440
and then

507
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,679
try to

508
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,360
find in this way a basis for the

509
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
relationship letters such that this

510
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
allows us to compute the group order and

511
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,280
even the entire structure of this group

512
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
however there's no known efficient way

513
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
to check if we have in fact found the

514
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
basis for the full relationship lattice

515
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for this problem we found the following

516
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
workaround if we have a finite division

517
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
in group g with some system of

518
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
generators

519
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,480
small g

520
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,600
and

521
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
the relationship letters with respect to

522
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,919
the system of generators has rank n

523
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,640
then any linearly independent set of

524
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
relations r1 up to

525
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
our n is going to form a full rank

526
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
subletters of this relationship lattice

527
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,120
and in this case we can also show that

528
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
the absolute value of the determinant of

529
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
this system of relations r is going to

530
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,880
be an integer multiple of the group g

531
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
so in this way we can use

532
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
and adversely solving some given

533
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,200
computational problem g to obtain n

534
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,840
in

535
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,000
linearly independent relations with

536
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
respect to some system of generators and

537
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,280
in this way obtain a multiple of the

538
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
order of g and so solve the multiple

539
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
order problem and

540
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,559
checking if some system of relations is

541
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
linearly independent

542
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
over the reals or over the

543
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
um

544
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
over the rationals is easier than

545
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
checking whether we have found a basis

546
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,158
for the entire relationship left

547
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,919
so now we can try to turn this idea of

548
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
collecting linearly independent

549
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
relations from uh net virtually solving

550
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
a computational problem g

551
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
into an anniversary which computes a

552
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,960
multiple of the order into

553
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
a more formal uh sketch of a production

554
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
so the idea here as i said before is to

555
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
obtain n linearly independent relations

556
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
with respect to some system generators

557
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
from an adversary solving computational

558
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
problem g

559
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
and then as we've seen in the previous

560
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
slide the determinant of this system of

561
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
relations is going to be a multiple of

562
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
the order of g

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,159
so the challenges in proving this

564
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
reduction are well the first one we need

565
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
to show that we can extract relations

566
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
from an adversary successfully solving

567
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
the instance of this computational

568
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,360
problem

569
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
the second challenge is is we need to

570
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
randomize instances

571
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,159
of this gain such that the atrocity

572
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,720
succeeds with independent and identical

573
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,400
success probability on each instance

574
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
such that the adversity succeeds on n

575
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,000
out of capital and instances with

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,280
sufficiently large probability

577
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,200
and finally that end of these

578
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,679
successfully extracted relations will be

579
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
linearly independent with overwhelming

580
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
probability

581
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
before we show a bit more formally how

582
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
we can tackle these

583
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,200
challenges

584
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,679
for the reduction of ammo to some

585
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,080
computational game g we first need to

586
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
introduce some more notation

587
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
so all computational games g

588
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
which we consider are the find with

589
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,039
vector group family

590
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,640
which is indexed by the security

591
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,679
parameter

592
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
or yeah

593
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,000
um and then for every security parameter

594
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,679
we assume that there exists some group

595
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,679
order upper bounds such that for all

596
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
security parameters and all groups in

597
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
the group family the order of the group

598
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,000
is upper bounded by

599
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
this upper bound uk furthermore we

600
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,960
assume that the logarithm of this

601
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
upper bound is polynomial and that one

602
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,360
over this upper bound is negligible and

603
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,039
it's reasonable to assume that such an

604
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,400
upper bound exists

605
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
because

606
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
if we have some upper bound on

607
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
representations of the of the group

608
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,559
elements as as bits for instance then

609
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,760
um well 2 to the power the upper bound

610
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,480
on the size of these representations

611
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,559
is going to be some upper bounds on the

612
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
order of the group

613
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,880
furthermore we assume

614
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,279
that there exists some random group

615
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,520
generator count which is polynomial in

616
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,120
the security parameter such that

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
if we sample

618
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,799
n uniformly random elements from the

619
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,080
group they will generate the group with

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
overwhelming probability and we've

621
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
already seen in the beginning of this

622
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
presentation that this in particularly

623
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,279
holds

624
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,640
for

625
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
n equal to two times the log of the

626
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
group order

627
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,640
which

628
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
which is polynomial by

629
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,200
uh

630
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
our first assumption on the group order

631
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,520
upper bound

632
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,120
furthermore we introduced the notation

633
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,960
where for some m times n matrix

634
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
a we um

635
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
we can raise a system of generators to

636
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,559
the paritis matrix by which we mean uh

637
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,960
the tuple which consists of the elements

638
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,039
we obtain by raising the system of

639
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,400
generators

640
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,480
separately to the

641
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
um rows

642
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
or the

643
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
yeah to the

644
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
rows of this matrix

645
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
and

646
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
we denote with square bracket because um

647
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,279
x square brackets subscript g one up to

648
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,080
g l uh for a representation of the some

649
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
kugan and x with respect to some other

650
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
group elements g one up to g l and that

651
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,840
is um some integer representation as for

652
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,480
instance an uh algebra group model

653
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,840
adversary outputs

654
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
and finally from here on we assume that

655
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
the security parameter kappa is fixed

656
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,080
and we often omit it for um for gravity

657
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
so the first challenge for proving our

658
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
reduction was showing that we can

659
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
extract relations from

660
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
the first resolving so computational

661
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,520
gain

662
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
g and the leading example we will take

663
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
for the rest of the presentation is an

664
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,679
adversary a solving the strong root

665
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,240
problem which

666
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,559
which is defined as follows

667
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,559
a random group element is sampled which

668
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,440
is given to the adversary together with

669
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,320
some

670
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
system of generators or some randomly

671
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,640
sampled system of generators and this

672
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
virtually outputs a group element y

673
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
together with some integer e

674
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,799
and the adversary wins the game if this

675
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,240
e is greater than 1 and if y is in each

676
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,440
root of the element x

677
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,240
now

678
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,559
if we have an algebraic adversary

679
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,720
solving the strong problem then we can

680
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,520
construct a relation sampler as follows

681
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,200
we sample

682
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
some random

683
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,000

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
vector

685
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,200
r in the interval 1 up to u cubed and

686
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
create a group element x with known

687
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
representation

688
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
r from the system of generators g that

689
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,440
we have

690
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,240
then we query the adversary on input

691
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
this system of generators g

692
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,760
and this group element x and it returns

693
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,880
us an integer e and some group element y

694
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
together with a representation of y in

695
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,159
terms of g and x and

696
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,880
we simply call this representation

697
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,159
b comma c

698
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,039
for future reference here now if the

699
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,880
anniversary succeeds and correctly

700
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
outputs in each root of the element x

701
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,039
then we can

702
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,880
write all the elements y and x in terms

703
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
of this

704
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,279
system of group elements g and in this

705
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,600
way um

706
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,039
return some relation r times one minus c

707
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,600
times e minus b times e

708
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
um

709
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,440
with respect to this um

710
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,080
system of group elements g and if the

711
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
university does not succeed the relation

712
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,440
sampler simply imports

713
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
now we see that the relation sampler

714
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,799
succeeds with

715
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,559
with probability

716
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
equal to the success probability of the

717
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,279
adversary in the strong root game uh

718
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,960
conditioned on

719
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,919
the group g and the system of generators

720
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,360
g being sampled um on a single call but

721
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,480
it's difficult to say anything about

722
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
repeated calls with respected to the

723
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,360
same

724
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
group and the same

725
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,080
system of generators so we have to

726
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,039
do some extra tricks to

727
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,600
to get multiple relations out of a

728
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
tertiary solving this strong root

729
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,240
problem

730
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
but what we can do is we can define the

731
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
following randomized relation sampler

732
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,640
for some algebraic stronghold at first

733
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,679
rea

734
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,360
again the relation sampler takes this

735
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,200
input to group g out of this group

736
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,399
family and some system of group elements

737
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,600
g

738
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
and but now next to sampling some random

739
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,559
element x

740
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,880
with respect to this system of elements

741
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
g it also

742
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,159
samples some random

743
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,960
new system of generators g tilde with

744
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
respect to this system of group elements

745
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
g

746
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,760
and it gives this new

747
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
generators together with this random

748
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
group elements to the adversary and

749
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,399
sort of does the same steps that

750
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,799
our previous relation sampler does and

751
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,480
in this way

752
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,760
obtains

753
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
again a relation with respect to this

754
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,039
original system of group elements

755
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,240
g

756
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
now what we can see

757
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
is that

758
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,000
um well if we let b prime

759
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,360
subscript

760
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,480
group g

761
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
system generator sheet with the success

762
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
probability of the relation sampler on

763
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
this specific group and system of

764
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,679
elements then if the group is indeed

765
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
generated by this system of elements

766
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
then we see that

767
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,200
or then we can show that g tilde and x

768
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,559
are

769
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
at negligible statistical distance to

770
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,919
the uniform distribution over this group

771
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,640
and so because of this

772
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
we know that um well if g tilde and x

773
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,880
are indeed uniformly distributed then

774
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,279
they are exactly distributed the way

775
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,039
that instances

776
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,000
um

777
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
in this game

778
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,080
in the strong root game are distributed

779
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
and so we see that

780
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
the success problem with the p prime

781
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,720
subscript gt is negligibly close to

782
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
the average success probability of the

783
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
strong root adversary

784
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,360
conditioned on

785
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,120
the group g

786
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
and

787
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,600
the event that the group g is not

788
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
generated

789
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,240
by this system of elements g

790
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,880
only happens with negligible probability

791
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
over uh the random sampling of a group

792
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,600
from the group family and um

793
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
a system of elements from the group and

794
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
so um we will later see that we can

795
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
ignore this event most of the time

796
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,799
and still

797
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,120
obtain a sufficient success probability

798
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,158
over multiple calls

799
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
so in particular we see that if the

800
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,360
group g is generated by the system of

801
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,679
elements g then each goal of the

802
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
relation sampler has independent and

803
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
identical success probability and this

804
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
is something that we can later use to

805
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,320
bound the success probability of the

806
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,240
relation sampler over

807
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,600
multiple calls

808
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
next we want to determine the total

809
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
number of calls that we need to

810
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,519
call the relation sampler on to obtain n

811
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
relations with a sufficiently large

812
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,279
probability so in other words um

813
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,960
if we let p be the average success

814
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
probability of the adversary a and we

815
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,480
define capital n to be s n over p

816
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,519
um then what is the probability of to

817
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,480
obtain n relations with respect to the

818
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,279
system of generators g from capital n

819
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
calls to the adversary on randomized

820
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,039
instances from the group g

821
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,159
well the first

822
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,080
observation is that the number of

823
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,120
successful calls to this relation

824
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,440
sampler has binomial distribution

825
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
with

826
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,200
n samples and success probability p

827
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
prime

828
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,080
and on the previous slide we saw that if

829
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,880
this

830
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
these elements

831
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
g in fact generate the whole group

832
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
then we saw that this probability p

833
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,440
prime was negligibly close to this

834
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,760
probability p sub g

835
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
and

836
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,039
since we're only doing

837
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,080
a polynomial number capital n of course

838
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
these binomial distributions also have

839
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,039
negligible so this conditions to each

840
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,840
other

841
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
in lemma 2.6 for work we show using a

842
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,760
churn of bound that if we have a random

843
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,559
variable which is distributed

844
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,279
binomially with n symbols and success

845
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,880
probability p g then the probability of

846
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,720
a random choice of g

847
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,960
that

848
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,320
that we sample n successes from this

849
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,159
binomial distribution

850
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,360
is greater or equal to p over two times

851
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,799
one minus e to the power minus n times c

852
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,600
s

853
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,799
where c s is this expression in s which

854
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,679
is positive and grows as

855
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,399
s s grows

856
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
so finally using this we see we can

857
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,360
conclude that out of sn over b randomize

858
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,320
calls to adversary a we can successfully

859
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,880
extract n relations with probability

860
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,519
greater or equal to b over two times one

861
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,600
minus e to the power e to the power

862
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
minus m times c s minus some negligible

863
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,039
difference

864
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,480
and so it remains to show is that

865
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
unsuccessfully extracted relations will

866
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,639
be linearly independent with

867
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,679
overwhelming probability

868
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,918
so looking again at the relation samples

869
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,599
that we obtained from this algebraic

870
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,320
strong root adversary a we see that if

871
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,879
the adversary outputs an element y which

872
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,440
is an eight root the element x then we

873
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
accept then we obtain relations this

874
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,199
form uh r times one minus c e minus b a

875
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
e

876
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,280
with respect to the system of generators

877
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
g

878
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
and so looking at this coordinate advice

879
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,918
for the generator gj we get the

880
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,719
following expression

881
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,719
and now if we split

882
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,639
these random

883
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,159
coefficients rj that we sampled to

884
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,520
generate our random element x which is

885
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,000
the challenge element we gave to the

886
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,160
adversary a

887
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,480
we see that if we split this element rj

888
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,520
as the residue of rj modulo the order of

889
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,320
the generator plus the multiples of the

890
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,440
order of the generator that are present

891
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,599
in this coefficient rj

892
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,079
then we see that all the group elements

893
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,560
that we give to the adversary a only

894
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,320
depend on this residue are prime j and

895
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
so finally the output of this adversary

896
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,440
is going to be independent of the r

897
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,880
prime prime j

898
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
um or independent of the multiples of

899
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,880
this um

900
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,520
order of this generator that are present

901
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
in this um

902
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,119
in this random coefficient

903
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
um and so the idea here is that if we

904
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,480
sample

905
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
these rj from some large enough interval

906
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,200
then the r prime prime j

907
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
randomly shifts the relationship

908
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
coefficients along this relationship

909
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,520
lattice and so

910
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
we can use this to show that the

911
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,640
relations we ultimately obtained from

912
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,040
this adversary will be

913
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
distributed close to

914
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,839
a uniform

915
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,880
so to show that these

916
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
relationship coefficients are in the

917
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
indeed going to be distributed randomly

918
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
we can do the following we can pick a

919
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,040
prime between the group order divided by

920
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,119
two and the group order which is co

921
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,320
prime two of these one minus ce and

922
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,800
since the version needs to output a

923
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,680
non-trivial root it needs to output an e

924
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,440
greater than one so these terms one

925
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,560
minus c e are going to be unequal to one

926
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
then we can expand these relationship

927
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,240
coefficients as the term r prime prime j

928
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
times

929
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,800
something which is co prime to this

930
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,599
prime

931
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
plus r prime j times something that is

932
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,680
independent of r prime prime j

933
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,599
plus some other term which is

934
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,240
independent of the r prime function

935
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
and then we show in our

936
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,280
work that sampling uh these coefficients

937
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,680
randomly uh uniformly from some large

938
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
enough interval u cubed then the

939
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,680
distribution of these r prime prime

940
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
modulo this prime b

941
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,520
conditioned on any value of the r primes

942
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,760
in the interval a zero up to the order

943
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,359
of this generator

944
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,400
um

945
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
then this distribution has negligible

946
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,560
statistical distance to the uniform

947
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,839
distribution um from that b to the power

948
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,880
n

949
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
um

950
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,680
so what we can see is that since these

951
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,839
are prime prime j are going to be

952
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,839
negligibly close to the uniform

953
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,920
distribution then if these were

954
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
distributed uniform and we would

955
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
multiply them by something go prime and

956
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
add some independent terms to it and

957
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
some um

958
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
yeah add some independent terms to it

959
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
then these relationship coefficients

960
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,400
will still be distributed

961
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
um

962
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,000
uniform modulo b so if our prime prime j

963
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,240
is distributed close to uniform modulo p

964
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,920
then this whole relationship

965
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,480
coefficients will also be distributed

966
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,079
negligibly close

967
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,760
to uniform modulo p

968
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,800
so

969
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,160
ultimately we obtain some relation d1 up

970
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,440
to dn such that the reduction of this

971
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,839
relation modulo p is distributed

972
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,599
negatively close to the uniform

973
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,320
distribution on set p to the power n

974
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
so now we have shown that we can obtain

975
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
relations d1 up to the n which are

976
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,160
distributed negligibly close to uniform

977
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
modulo p or some prime p which lies

978
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,320
between the group order and the group

979
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
order divided by two

980
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,920
from this we can deduce that the

981
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,800
probability that the determinant of

982
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,079
these

983
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,640
of these relations

984
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,400
of this system of relations is going to

985
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,960
be going into zero modulo b is smaller

986
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,640
than n over p plus some negligible

987
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,960
some negligible statistical distance

988
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,960
because um for uniformly distributed uh

989
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,359
d1 up to the n the probability that the

990
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
determinant is going to be congruent to

991
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,839
zero modulus b can easily be shown to be

992
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,320
smaller than n over p and since we

993
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
picked this front b greater than g over

994
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
two we see that this probability is

995
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,880
smaller than two n over the order of the

996
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
group plus some negligible

997
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,400
distance and since we assumed n to be

998
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,640
polynomial and the order of the group is

999
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,240
super polynomial

1000
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,880
this probability is going to be at most

1001
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,119
negligible

1002
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,040
and what we can use now is that the

1003
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,200
probability that the determinant of this

1004
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,599
system of relations is going to be equal

1005
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,839
to zero is smaller or equal than the

1006
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,000
probability that the determinant of this

1007
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
system of relations is going to be

1008
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,119
congruent to zero modulo p

1009
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,320
um

1010
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,280
and so

1011
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
we see

1012
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,839
that

1013
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,599
finally see that and successfully

1014
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,920
extracted relations are going to be

1015
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
linearly independent with overwhelming

1016
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,119
probability which is exactly

1017
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,800
what we wanted to show

1018
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
so coming back to the overview of our

1019
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,800
reduction um sketch for uh the reduction

1020
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,720
of the multiple order problem to some

1021
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,480
computational problem g

1022
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,040
we have shown through our example of a

1023
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,839
strong root of reduction of ammo to the

1024
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,400
strong root problem that we can tackle

1025
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
all of these challenges um for this

1026
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,680
particular uh for for a particular

1027
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,000
strong root adversary but in fact um

1028
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,359
most of our

1029
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,800
reductions for other computational

1030
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
problems follow a very similar

1031
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
sort of template as as i've shown in

1032
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
this presentation and only on some

1033
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,920
specific parts of the challenges there

1034
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
are some some individual details that

1035
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,319
are different for each problem and where

1036
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,319
we have to pay a bit of attention to

1037
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,240
show that everything goes well

1038
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,880
but so what we have shown now finally is

1039
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,960
that we can obtain a multiple of the

1040
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,359
group order with probability greater

1041
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,760
than the average success probability of

1042
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,800
the adversary a times this term one

1043
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,520
minus e to the power minus m times c s

1044
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,640
over two

1045
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,800
up to some negligible terms and then we

1046
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,480
can do so in time at most sn over b

1047
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,560
times the average running time of the

1048
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,680
adversary a up to some significant terms

1049
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
so

1050
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,079
so we succeeded in showing this this

1051
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,000
reduction of the multiple order problem

1052
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,760
to

1053
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,480
to in this case this strong root problem

1054
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,040
and so now we have shown that we can

1055
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,119
obtain a multiple of the order from from

1056
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,119
certain adversary solving

1057
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,160
computational problems g it's a natural

1058
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,599
question to ask

1059
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
in which cases we can also obtain the

1060
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,160
exact order of the group from these

1061
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,319
adversaries and what we show in our work

1062
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,000
is that for cyclic groups of hidden

1063
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,359
order we can obtain the exact order from

1064
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,680
some standard model adversary solving

1065
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
the discrete logarithm problem and that

1066
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,839
is that the hidden order problem reduces

1067
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,800
to the d-log problem in this case

1068
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
and to prove this we use

1069
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,599
a technical theorem which proof which we

1070
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,440
prove

1071
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,280
which um

1072
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,440
which says something about the greatest

1073
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
common divisor of some uniformly

1074
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,839
distributed random variables which are

1075
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,920
shifted by some um

1076
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
some some

1077
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,880
integer uh bounded shifts and that

1078
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
in this case still

1079
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,240
the

1080
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,760
these um

1081
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,520
the shifted random variables are going

1082
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,400
to be

1083
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
um

1084
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
are going to be co-prime with large

1085
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,480
probability

1086
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,359
now

1087
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,359
it's still an open question if this

1088
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,440
reduction in fact generalizes to a

1089
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,359
billion groups so if you can show that

1090
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,680
the hidden order problem reduces to for

1091
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
instance the d log one or the d log2

1092
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,520
problems for

1093
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,640
abelian groups of hidden order

1094
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,400
and we furthermore note that for

1095
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
computational problems g which actually

1096
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,119
reduced to the multiple order problem we

1097
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,119
do not expect a reduction from the

1098
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,599
hidden order problem to this particular

1099
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,960
problem g

1100
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
to be possible

1101
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,119
and this is before because any adversary

1102
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,400
that cancels

1103
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,800
a g can solve this problem g by always

1104
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
restricting to a strict subletters of

1105
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,240
the relationship lattice and

1106
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,400
on the other hand knowledge of the full

1107
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,880
letters is required to solve this hidden

1108
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,440
order problem so this is a bit of the

1109
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,760
intuition that we have why this isn't

1110
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,520
possible but this isn't really something

1111
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,359
that we made formal in our work

1112
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,680
so to recap in our work we formalized um

1113
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,480
the

1114
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
the abelian hidden order standard model

1115
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,880
of the union order algebra group model

1116
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,720
and a billion hidden order strong

1117
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
algebraic group model

1118
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,280
so that these computational models are

1119
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,280
suitable for the study of billion groups

1120
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,520
of hidden order an important part of

1121
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,200
this was to adapt the definition of

1122
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,359
cryptographic problems to sample a

1123
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,440
random group from a group family and a

1124
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,359
random set of generators at the start of

1125
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,480
the game and of course to not give

1126
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,560
the order of the group to

1127
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,720
any adversary playing a particular game

1128
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,640
furthermore we studied relations between

1129
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,400
cryptographic problems in a billion

1130
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
hidden groups and billion groups of

1131
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,960
hidden order in these models

1132
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,480
and so in the beaten hidden order

1133
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
standard model we've shown that the

1134
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,720
multiple order problem reduces to the d

1135
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,839
log one and the d-log two problem and

1136
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,800
it follows from shoop's impossibility

1137
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,720
result that no efficient generic

1138
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
reductions exist in the opposite

1139
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,160
direction

1140
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,280
um

1141
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,760
in the obedient hidden order algebraic

1142
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,599
group model we've shown that the

1143
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,920
multiple order problem is equivalent to

1144
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,560
the e root problem the aloe problem the

1145
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
strong problem and the adaptive root

1146
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,520
problem um under some additional current

1147
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
additions for the e root and the aloe

1148
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,000
problem and we've shown that the ammo

1149
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,359
problem reduces to the cdh2 problem and

1150
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,079
all of these we've shown using our new

1151
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,160
template for extracting random

1152
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,079
independent relations from algebraic

1153
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,680
adversaries which i gave a sketch of in

1154
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,720
the

1155
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,839
earlier part of this presentation

1156
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,560
and finally

1157
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,800
we've shown in the obedient hidden order

1158
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
strong algebra group model that the

1159
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,040
multiple order problem is equivalent to

1160
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,920
the repeated squaring problem and the

1161
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,400
the way to show this is similar to how

1162
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,839
we showed the other reductions in the

1163
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,040
alternative model but using that

1164
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,119
adversary uses some bounded depth

1165
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,480
algebraic circuit

1166
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,280
instead of an algebraic representation

1167
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,200
for its output group elements

1168
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,240
so finally for some open questions one

1169
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,000
open question i mentioned before is is

1170
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,920
it possible to reduce the hidden order

1171
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,560
problem to the log 1 and d look 2 for

1172
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,640
abelian groups and so some questions

1173
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
that arise here are is there a way to

1174
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,920
check that the obtained relations

1175
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,079
actually generate the full letters in an

1176
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,319
efficient way or can we guarantee that

1177
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,800
several independently obtained multiples

1178
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,319
of the order have greatest common

1179
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,560
divisor equal to the exact order with

1180
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
high probability and that is sort of the

1181
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,960
approach that worked for us in the

1182
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,839
uh in the cyclic case but which is still

1183
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,640
open in the abelian case

1184
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,000
and moreover an interesting

1185
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,720
question to look at is when a reduction

1186
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,000
of d log to cdh is possible in the

1187
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,400
hidden order of the rare group model and

1188
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
some earlier works showed that this is

1189
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
possible for cyclic groups of known

1190
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,160
prime order in the agm

1191
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,280
and some seminal works by modern wolf in

1192
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,240
1998 showed that this is possible for

1193
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,000
cyclic groups of known order

1194
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
in the generic group model if all

1195
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,640
multiple prime factors of the group

1196
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,560
order a polynomial in the

1197
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,800
logarithm of the group order

1198
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,119
and they also showed that no generic

1199
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,200
reduction exists when the group is

1200
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,000
cyclic and the group order is divisible

1201
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,800
by b squared for some large prime b

1202
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,079
thanks a lot for tuning in to this

1203
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,079
recorded talk and if you're interested

1204
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,000
to learn more about the work i want to

1205
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,480
refer you to your full version which is

1206
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,400
up on eprint and

1207
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,160
if you have any questions remaining feel

1208
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,040
free to send me an email at my cwi email

1209
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,319
address which is

1210
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,599
mentioned here

1211
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,079
thanks
