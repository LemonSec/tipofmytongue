00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,400
then please go ahead

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,759
all right so welcome everyone to the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,919
first session which is dedicated to post

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,599
quantum crypto

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,160
there will be six stocks and we have one

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,719
hour so we have like five minutes for

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,199
the presentation and five minutes for

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
short questions and switch of slides

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
we have also a zoom chat so please feel

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
free to ask questions you can either put

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
we can either use chat

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,800
of zoom or chat of zulip

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
i think that's it for the administration

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,840
part and it's my pleasure to introduce

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,559
our first speaker daniela cozzo

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,000
who will be talking about gladios lwr

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,879
based efficient hybrid public encryption

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,440
with distributed decryption this is a

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
joint work with kellogg varun maram and

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
nigel smart daniel the floors is yours

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,399
all right

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
thanks for introducing me

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,680
so this is gladys and

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,079
hybrid cipher which is optimized for

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,879
distributed decryption

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
so um

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,439
okay so um in distributed description we

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
want to

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
the cyanide public key encryption for

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
which we can

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
efficiently implement the decryption

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
with a secure protocol

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
uh the basic primitive uh

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,240
must be should be insisted secure

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
past quantum and should also be able to

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
uh encrypt

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
any message so we are

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
we will need some like to use in a

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,840
combination of chem and

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
then

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
so

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,759
so if we start looking at the

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,520
most famous hybrids uh around it's like

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,399
the

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
comet shop hybrid so it uses again a cam

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
and a dem

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,960
account to

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
encapsulate the session key and then to

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
them to encrypt the actual message

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,730
so it's in cca

51
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,479
[Music]

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,720
in cca secure um also is post quantum if

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
the chem is and can uh encrypt any

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
message so we are almost there the

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,760
problem is that

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
um if we try to distribute this uh well

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
we got some efficiency problems because

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
um

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
after the the cap selection they see the

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,640
key the session kiosks is still secrets

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
and this means that we need to

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,120
um

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
implement this as a secure protocol

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
which for

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,280
long messages uh you means that you need

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
to do that many times so and this

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
operation is usually expensive for

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,959
general

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
uh multi-party computation techniques so

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
um

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
we would like to avoid the doing this

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,360
and

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
so the naive idea of just opening the

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
the session key so that this could be

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,879
done over clear data doesn't work

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,760
because they say of this cca attack

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,200
so

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
to fix this we propose our hybrid cipher

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
and so it's again a combination of our

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,440
public key

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,280
encryption and the

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
encryption

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,239
parts we

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
use a secure hash function to

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
authenticate the session key here

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
what this means in the description is

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
that we verify

88
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
we verify

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
that the session key is uh valid

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
and only for that we can securely leak

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
release the session key

92
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
so that this operation

93
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,760
becomes

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
for free

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
from the point of your communication no

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
need of any

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,360
interactive protocol

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
so um yeah this is great because we are

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,319
also able to show that if we start with

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,640
a one-way cpa deterministic public

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
encryption and any of them we get an

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
intercca public key encryption in the

103
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
random oracle

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,080
model

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
so um

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
if we also add two hash functions we

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,480
also get the same that the same

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
statements holds in the quantum random

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
oracle model

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
so um

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,800
that is optimized because the only thing

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
that you

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
need to do in a secure way is the

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
decryption and the few hash

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
operations

116
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,000
so

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
the only thing that the

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
thing left to do is to find the

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
deterministic one-way cpa public

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
encryption

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
uh standard techniques like uh encrypt

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
hashing the message

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,960
uh don't work because you

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
could need to re-evaluate the

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
the key the derivation function in the

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
re-encryption over secret data and this

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
is super inefficient so we want to base

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
the encryption something that doesn't

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
need randomness

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
and this something is the

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
rounding map so

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
we propose this public key encryption

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,039
which is just

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
applying the rounding map to the message

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,479
so we get something which is

136
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,280
deterministic also post quantum

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,759
and one way again from the properties of

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
the running map and the decryption is

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
also

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
can be also efficiently distributed

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,479
um well not not

142
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
very clear from here but we designed the

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
protocol to be quite efficient on the

144
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
general multi-party

145
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
computation techniques

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,880
so um at the end what we get is a

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,719
general transform that takes

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
a public encryption which is

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
deterministic but still one-way cpa any

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
uh them and returns an ncca public key

151
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,440
encryption in the rom and also qram

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
it's again as i said optimize for

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
distributed computation because you only

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
need to distribute the decryption of the

155
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
cam and a few hushes

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
and

157
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
and also if you instantiate the public

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
encryption with a with our public key

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
encryption

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,280
which is based on directly in the lwr

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,639
map then

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
assumption then you don't even need to

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
do

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
expensive randomizations the

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
randomization operations

166
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
and so at the end what we get is a very

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
practical

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
um

169
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
public encryption which is like very

170
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,560
efficient like we got for

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
a standard benchmark

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
access structure

173
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
uh five seconds

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
to decrypt so with a this everyday

175
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
secure protocol

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
so i think that's all

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,960
and yeah

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
thank you donate

179
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,039
are there any questions i think we have

180
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,560
a couple of minutes for questions

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
so there don't appear to be any

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,120
questions in the zulu

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
but maybe i was wondering daniele uh so

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,479
you have this uh yeah you put his

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,120
emphasis on the deterministic encryption

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,840
so

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
do i conclude can i conclude from this

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,199
that the

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
gladius or the the method you propose is

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
not compatible with n2 with kyber

191
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
anything like that

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
um so um

193
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
okay i say remember correctly and true

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
and true primes

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
also have something

196
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
deterministic but they need to

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
uh to do

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
like use this um

199
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,400
they need to they randomize a

200
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
probabilistic

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
uh public encryption and we don't want

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,840
to do this okay

203
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
but in theory

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,479
it's possible or

205
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,840
in practice it's possible

206
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,520
[Music]

207
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
yeah you can

208
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
yeah you can start also with a

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,800
probabilistic public encryption you need

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
to

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
here do

212
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
um

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
if you you can use a probabilistic

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
public encryption

215
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,240
but then you need to also pass the first

216
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
cipher text to the hash function in

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
order to avoid the randomization attacks

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,639
yeah

219
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
so it might be compatible

220
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,839
yeah

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
okay thank you

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
um

223
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,559
yeah i don't see any other questions

224
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
i don't have any questions either so

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
thank you donated once again

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,000
great and i think it's a good time to

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,660
switch to the second speaker

228
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,000
[Music]

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
uh jing can you share your

230
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,880
slides

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
perfect

232
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
thank you

233
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
so our second speaker will be jing pen

234
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
who will be talking about lattice-based

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
group encryption with full dynamicity

236
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,279
and message filtering policy joint work

237
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
joint work with xavin chen fango zhang

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,040
and willie sosilo jing you can start

239
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
okay

240
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
okay

241
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,560
help um yes we can hear you okay okay oh

242
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
hello it's my pleasure to give us a

243
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
prediction about native space group

244
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
impression with the first dimension and

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
the messaging feature policy it's a

246
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
journal to work by chimpanzee cell phone

247
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
chain fungal drug analysis

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
this talk we will show our work from the

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
fully full spect

250
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
group equation is a fundamental

251
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
anonymity primitive analog of a group

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
signature it consists of these

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,440
algorithms by concerning valuable

254
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,120
responses four specific supplies within

255
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
a group of certified

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
certified populations while giving

257
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
traceability to anybody's program it

258
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
provides

259
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,680
the

260
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,240
confidentiality anonymity and visibility

261
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
since its first of us the group revision

262
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
has found a word of applications in the

263
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,959
realistic world such as justice parties

264
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
oblivious retrieval story systems

265
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
helicopter signatures and the

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
eucharistic immunofactory according to

267
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
the actual model that group vision can

268
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
be extracted from our secure digital

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
signature as they say

270
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
anonymous probability equation and a

271
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,959
zero negative argument

272
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
our motivations are zone numerous group

273
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,200
equation has been proposed only the

274
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
paragram and the ssc were are quantum

275
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
resistant moreover only in the

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
spots are fully dynamicity and domestic

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
vital policy here these two properties

278
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
are very important in

279
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
promoting the basic application of a

280
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
group equation especially in the azure

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,920
over equipment email filtering it is a

282
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
survey frame of obscure security

283
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
experiment extreme efficiency and weak

284
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
security

285
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
some of you may ask a question can we

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
propose a relative space scheme with

287
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
further density and negative policy

288
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
while replacing the exact cause another

289
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
two scratching is positive according to

290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,760
the model design presented by the qti

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,600
the group equation can be constrained

292
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
from a security signature under say

293
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
to keep previous public key under the

294
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,959
argument

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
genesis general design some motivation

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,320
is a ticket to each other foreign but it

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
utilizes an updatable accumulator to

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
fully certify group membership then the

299
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
gpo2 encryption is utilized to

300
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
equip the weakness and the respiratory

identity finally jager was a religious

302
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,839
framework is used to demonstrate the

303
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
validating hours of tests by the designs

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
we achieve therefore density and

305
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
this key space which is rushed into a

306
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,839

307
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,600
fishes the main difficulties in this

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
work is reduced to performance or zero

framework

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
yeah yeah i told the framework is

312
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
abstract as alexis here i'm and why our

313
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
public matrix and victory x is a

314
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,720
secondary security factory the flow

315
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,680
module the flow body arm is the set of

316
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
three top of hh of which exercise is

317
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
equal to the product of x and fc it

318
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,120
incorporates the short norm under the

319
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
hydrometrics regular production

320
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
relations

321
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
now we consider to prove that anarchy is

322
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,839
not

323
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,720
oh

324
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
for the problem all these previous

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
relative master are disabled so they

326
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,279
consider the

327
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,680
abstraction and transformation to

328
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,800
equal

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
relation here i'm

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
april we wanted to prove

331
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
alpha is less than the sum of x i where

332
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
alpha is a function value with taking

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,200
alpha one two alpha is input

334
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
now next i will consider the proof for

335
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
the message filter policy

336
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,160
now to come up policies includes a

337
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
theory the first there is a premise type

338
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
and the second is the programming type

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
these these two policies are defined as

340
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
respectively here we notice the proof

341
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,120
method in the latest setting uh no no

342
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
especially under the data framework

343
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,920
moreover the proof of the promise type

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
is trivial and incorporated into that

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
proof for the preview type so we only

346
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
need to consider the proof for the

347
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,880
second

348
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
the difficulty for this uh exposure pro

349
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
for the proof is like this

350
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,320
accordingly we provide our

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
our solution like this

352
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
we know that the

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
second point is basic part key

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
our calculation is like this thank you

355
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,800
for your attention

356
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,439
any questions

357
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
so i don't see any questions on the

358
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,079
zulip or in the chat

359
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
i was just wondering this nns reference

360
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
you gave

361
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
what is it exactly it's something

362
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
that post dates the acceptance to

363
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,199
asiacrypt here

364
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,560
is it

365
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
it seems very recent uh nns21

366
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
who are the authors of that paper or

367
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
which paper is that

368
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,839
um

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
hello do you hear me

370

excuse me

371
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,079
yeah i was wondering the nss

372
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,638
21 reference

373
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
yeah i was just wondering if this is a

374
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
like follow-up work to your work or or

375
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
is it a

376
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
concurrent work

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
it's just curiosity it's not not very

378
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,800
important of course

379
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
i can help your nss is from

380
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
pkc to 2021

381
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,800
ah okay

382
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
thank you very much that is written by

383
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,079
nang at all in pkc2021

384
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,199
thank you

385
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,439
thank you

386
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,320
all right i'm a bit sorry i also had

387
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,079
some troubles with my internet

388
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,320
um

389
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
so let's move on to the third speaker to

390
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,279
the third talk

391
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,399
hiroki can you please share your slides

392
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,279
yes thank you

393
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,880
so our third talk will be on new variant

394
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
of unbalanced oil and vinegar using

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,839
quotient ring

396
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,040
q-r-u-o-v the talk will be given by

397
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,240
hiroki furu this is a joint work with

398
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,480
yes

399
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
hierarchy you can start

400
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
thank you for the introduction

401
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,720
i'm here today and i'm going to talk

402
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
about a new variant of ambrose oil and

403
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
vinegar using concentric for your boy

404
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,559
in this

405
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,280
research we propose a new variant of

406
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
grand soil and vinegar

407
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
which is

408
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,599
one of multivariate signature schemes

409
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,559
in the key generation step of uk

410
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,760
we first generate a aj multiple quality

411
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
map if

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
such that each polynomial fk has like

413
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
this form and

414
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
randomly choose a linear map s

415
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
and finally

416
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,960
the

417
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
tick mark p is given by the composing

418
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
encounter x and this b is public key and

419
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
secret key is

420
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,918
econds

421
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
next i introduce a representation

422
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,039
matrices for the public and secret case

423
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
of your way

424
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
when we assume the orders of knight

425
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,760
field is old and then each fundamental

426
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,880
xy

427
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
can be is represented by

428
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,760
enzymes and symmetric matrix

429
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
whose every lower right some matrix is

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
matrix like this and

431
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
s is represented by

432
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
a end of synonyms and

433
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
in addition

434
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,960
each polynomial pi of the public kp

435
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,919
is also represented by adams and

436
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,880
symmetric matrix vi and this is obtained

437
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,760
by

438
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
s transpose fys

439
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
here i introduce

440
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,320
matrices

441
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,919
corresponding to

442
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
elements of quotient ring

443
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
that is used in a proposed variant

444
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,520
let there be a positive integer and fb

445
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
polynomial in fqx with the degree l

446
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
uh for any random g in the call

447
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
centering f q x x we can uniquely define

448
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
uh every time zero matrix y j f uh

449
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
satisfying this equation

450
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,760
and

451
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
this proportion shows that uh

452
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
if f equals x is above l minus x to the

453
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,559
power one i i minus one and w is uh l

454
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,600
times zero matrix uh like this form then

455
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,480
for any element g in the call centering

456
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
w igf which is symmetric

457
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,919
by using these matrices

458
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,919
we propose a new variant qru ok

459
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
in the key generation step

460
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
first we choose uh

461
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,600
polynomial f of the form x to the power

462
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,039
minus a x plus bob i minus one and uh l

463
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,520
times zero matrix w such that for an

464
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
element g in the quotient ring and w i j

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
which metric second and the

466
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
representation matrix is fy was a

467
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
secret key f uh

468
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,559
designed to be block w5 matrices

469
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
which are block matrices whose every

470
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
component and corresponds to

471
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,440
wrgf and s design is designed to be a

472
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,159
profile matrix

473
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,679
finally and the representation motor

474
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,640
says

475
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,919
pi for the valid key is obtained by an

476
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
estrogen suppose fis and this pi becomes

477
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
a broke w5 matrix

478
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,039
and then from the structure of

479
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,720
w5 and phi and this can reduce the

480
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
public key size

481
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
in the case of f equals x is above l

482
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,200
minus one and then 5ga is a cyclic

483
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,679
matrix like this and

484
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,559
actually there exists a variant of using

485
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,280
sacramento seeds which is caused by a

486
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,640
broken succulent yogurt but and attack

487
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,159
utilizing the property of sargon

488
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
boundaries was proposed at 20 20.

489
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
in this paper we prove that if we choose

490
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
f as i reduce voicemail and then our

491
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,320
variant is secure against and this other

492
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
conventionally

493
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,400
this table compares the

494
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
policy size and change the size of a

495
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
proposed qru way and

496
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
compress rainbow

497
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,080
which is

498
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,919
optimized variant of

499
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,559
rainbow and the result and the public

500
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
size of qrio gui

501
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,000
can be reduced by approximately from 50

502
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,679
to 70 percent and compared with that of

503
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,919
rainbow

504
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,960
at the cost of a small increase of

505
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
in signature size

506
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,960
about the security of theory away

507
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,200
we confirmed that

508
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
proposed parameters satisfy each and

509
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,559
satisfy the requirements of each

510
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,000
security level

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
like this table and

512
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
we

513
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
consider the existing attacks on your

514
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
way and

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,440
some attacks are utilizing the property

516
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
of caution drink

517
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,679
such as this purple attack and lifting

518
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,880
attacks

519
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
that's all thank you for listening

520
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
thank you hiroki

521
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,720
are there any questions

522
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
well while people are thinking about the

523
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,159
question say

524
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
i think i'd like to ask one

525
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
so you represented your scheme in terms

526
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,240
of the key sizes

527
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,840
which compare favorably to the previous

528
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,200
papers uh well key size and signature

529
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
size i said yes

530
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,039
how about the performance is it also

531
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,919
faster

532
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,520
uh

533
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,960
well performance

534
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
maybe it will be

535
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,159
not efficient

536
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
because and

537
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,799
it will be notification and compared

538
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,280
with that of rainbow

539
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
because the performance uh

540
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
highly dependent on the

541
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,600
number of variables of the

542
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,080
public key system and

543
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,360
the this the number of variables is

544
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,400
larger

545
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,640
than the case of rainbow so

546
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
the performance is not efficient

547
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,480
all right i see

548
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
thank you

549
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,159
are there any other questions

550
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
we don't have any in the

551
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
chat of the tulip

552
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,000
um i have a very naive question maybe

553
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
but maybe it doesn't even apply so

554
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
apologies in advance but did you check

555
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
like for

556
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,039
uh

557
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,520
relations between the equations and your

558
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
public key uh so

559
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,760
i guess they are linearly independent so

560
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,279
that's not a problem but you might also

561
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,480
have like

562
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,520
uh ccgs like uh relations with uh

563
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
coefficients that are

564
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,840
uh not

565
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
scalars

566
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
has anyone looked at that for these

567
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
structured

568
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
uov variants

569
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
sorry

570
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,880
so in these structured uov variants um

571
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
yeah i'm wondering but it's a very naive

572
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
question so maybe it doesn't make sense

573
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,840
if there are

574
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
if there happened to be any relations

575
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
between the equations in your public key

576
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,720
like

577
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
linear combinations that vanish but the

578
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
scalars in the linear combinations are

579
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,039
not not elements of fq but they are

580
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
polynomials themselves so these

581
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,559
relations are called ccgs

582
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,720
i was wondering if anyone has looked at

583
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
that

584
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
i was wondering if there's a risk

585
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,360
of uh introducing

586
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,679
scientists

587
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,120
when structuring

588
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,480
uov

589
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,360
but

590
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,060
please ignore my question if it's uh

591
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,089
[Music]

592
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
well actually again i think i can try to

593
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,679
formulate this question easily do you

594
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,240
think these properties of the maybe so

595
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
water please correct me

596
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,000
do you think that this additional

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
structure improves crop your basis

598
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,970
attacks

599
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,339
[Music]

600
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,720
experimentally confirmed that the

601
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,679
degree of priority of the

602
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,240
public key system of purpose carrier b

603
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,320
is

604
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,810
same is the same as

605
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,000
[Music]

606
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,039
that of

607
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,400
random nature's

608
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
quadratic system

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,919
so

610
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,039
so

611
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,520
due to this fact from from this fact i

612
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,159
we think that this is a

613
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,000
proposed variant is seeking against the

614
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
direct basis attack

615
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,240
yeah right okay thanks thanks uh thanks

616
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,080
i think we can move on to the next talk

617
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,360
maxine can you try sharing your slides

618
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
can you hear me

619
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
we can hear you

620
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
yes and we can also see your slides all

621
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,240
right so it's

622
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
my pleasure to introduce our next

623
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
speaker maxine ponson

624
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,200
who will be

625
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,039
presenting his joint work with vadim to

626
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,159
bachewski khan guyan and greg

627
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,840
on shorter lattice-based group

628
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,400
signatures for almost free encryption

629
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
and other optimizations maxine the floor

630
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,559
is yours

631
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
okay thank you

632
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
for the introduction so i can

633
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
dive straight into the presentation so

634
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,279
first let me give a reminder of what a

635
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
group signature is

636
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
so we're on the same page so in a group

637
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,559
segment we have some group members all

638
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,720
of which have some identity i in the

639
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
same calligraphic eye

640
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
we have a group manager with an opera

641
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,520
key

642
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,679
and we have a setup authority that gives

643
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,360
those individual signing keys to the

644
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
users and the opener key to the group

645
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
manager

646
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,679
so

647
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,520
from a high level we want two things

648
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,919
from a group signature scheme the first

649
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,760
one is we want that every member of the

650
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
group can sign on behalf of the whole

651
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,559
group

652
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
and the second we want that the group

653
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
manager is the only one who can trace a

654
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
signature back to the identity of the

655
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
signer so what this means is that a

656
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
signature should not leak information on

657
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,399
the signer but using the opener key the

658
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
group manager can tell the identity of

659
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
the signer

660
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
so the previous most efficient

661
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
lattice-based signatures group signature

662
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,279
scheme

663
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,120
was one from ccs2018 where the signature

664
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,000
size for groups of size about a million

665
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,320
was around 580 kilobytes

666
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
so in this paper we use a similar

667
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,159
structure for the protocol but we

668
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,640
improve on several parts of it

669
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,360
so for the same group size that is about

670
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,799
a million members

671
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,520
we reach 203 kilobytes for signature

672
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,360
um okay so now i will give two examples

673
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,679
of improvements we make

674
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
that could be of uh independent interest

675
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
or could be like a nice takeaway from

676
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
the talk

677
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
so

678
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
first about the title of the paper which

679
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
is the

680
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
almost free encryption part for the

681
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,880
group signature

682
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,480
so designer wants uh

683
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
to somewhat encrypt his identity for the

684
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,320
group manager to decrypt

685
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,559
so he also needs to prove that this

686
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
cipher text is well-formed so the

687
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,919
verifier is convinced that the

688
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,919
decryption would be correct

689
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
um

690
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
so now

691
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
here is uh the id uh we bring in this

692
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,640
paper

693
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
so the commitment of to the identity i

694
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
is of this form here and

695
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,399
if we make this change then

696
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,840
which is

697
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,678
basically playing ticket decryption key

698
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
s and e in the public vector for the

699
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,360
commitment scheme

700
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
then this does not interfere with the

701
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,120
security of the commitment but it makes

702
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
uh decryption possible for the group

703
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,200
manager uh who knows these uh spritz sme

704
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
so on top of this the zero noise proof

705
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
of wealth homeless uh

706
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,919
a proof of knowledge of the small r

707
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,520
solution to this

708
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,799
equation here

709
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,159
and this is already given in

710
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,559
some other proof of the signature

711
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,600
so this is why it's almost free

712
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
now the other contribution i want to

713
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,480
talk about today is this id here so the

714
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
signature contains a proof of knowledge

715
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,880
of a secret key which is this

716
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
s1 s2

717
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,120
solution to this equation here

718
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,559
so

719
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,880
a b g and u are public

720
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,799
but the identity i is uh is the identity

721
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,080
of designer and as i said in the

722
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,880
beginning this it cannot be given away

723
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
so

724
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,919
uh what we see is that uh if a prime was

725
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,720
public then this statement

726
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
um

727
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,799
could be proven as we usually do with a

728
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,600
verification equation of this form but

729
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
since a is not public

730
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,960
what we do is

731
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,039
we notice that the verifier can

732
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,600
construct a commitment to this a prime

733
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,440
from the commitment to i

734
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
and

735
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
yeah so if we add an extra commitment to

736
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
the w

737
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
from the previous slide

738
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
then you can see that this verification

739
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,559
equation becomes linear in the

740
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,760
commitments

741
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,880
and

742
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
linear equations

743
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
are very cheap to prove so in the end we

744
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,799
can give a fairly efficient proof of

745
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,240
knowledge of uh this secret key

746
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,360
uh okay so that that's about all i

747
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,799
wanted to say today

748
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,600
uh

749
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
the paper is available on knee prints

750
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
you can check the long video on youtube

751
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
if you want to know more

752
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,640
thank you for your attention

753
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,080
thank you maxine

754
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,639
are there any questions

755
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,840
so there don't seem to be any on the

756
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,690
zulip chat

757
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,320
[Music]

758
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
neither in the zoom chat while people

759
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,519
are thinking about the beautiful

760
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
questions so i'd like to ask one

761
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,799
question maybe very nice one

762
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,279
where do we actually use group

763
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
encryptions

764
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,000
uh so it's a group signature uh sorry

765
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
group signature sorry yeah no never mind

766
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
to be necessary

767
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,320
i uh as far as i know group signature is

768
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,159
like kind of useless in practice but

769
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,919
it's um like a benchmark to

770
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,799
see how powerful and efficient are like

771
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,360
some assumption of like for example here

772
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,000
what we show is the lattice-based zero

773
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
noise fruits are good enough to do

774
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,919
efficient group signatures

775
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,200
all right

776
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,679
connection

777
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,360
it has no connection to ring signatures

778
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
is it correct

779
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
because ring signatures they are used

780
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,960
as far as i know

781
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,640
this is out of my uh

782
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,240
of my uh

783
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,519
knowledge

784
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,399
all right

785
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
yeah i'm sorry

786
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
no problem thank you

787
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
i think if there are enough other

788
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
questions thank you maxim again

789
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,039
and we can move on to the next talk

790
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
the next stop will be given by taco

791
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,440
boris fotzo taco could you please share

792
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,159
your slides

793
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
perfect

794
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,840
all right so let me introduce our next

795
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,200
speaker

796
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,279
uh is taco boris forza who will be

797
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,480
speaking on

798
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,880
who will be actually give two talks

799
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,440
the first talk will be on sita

800
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,080
super singular encryption from torsion

801
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,679
attacks

802
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,960
written by a bunch of authors

803
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,559
which is

804
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
peter kotas christophe petit lucade

805
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,120
faire antonia leroux taco boris

806
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,960
and taco will be presenting this work

807
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
so taco please start

808
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,279
okay

809
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,519
can you hear me

810
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,960
yes yes we can

811
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
oh okay thanks

812
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,279
so thanks for the introduction elena i

813
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,960
am boris and i'm going to present sheta

814
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,559
super singular encryption for some

815
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,120
points in personal equipment from

816
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,640
torsion points attack

817
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,799
so at the third rounds of the needs

818
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,440
competition we have one hydrogen based

819
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
scheme which is psych

820
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
and the main advantage of hydrogen based

821
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
scheme is that they provide very compact

822
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
case that they suffer off of

823
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,159
efficiency they have a relatively poor

824
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,760
efficiency compared to the other

825
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
candidates

826
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,040
isogenic-based cryptography is a very

827
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,800
young field and there are many schemes

828
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
that are being proposed

829
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,839
there are

830
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,679
most of the scheme proposed till now

831
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,560
there are

832
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,359
different type key exchanges and elgamal

833
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,679
type encryptions so in this paper what

834
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,159
we do is that we propose a new

835
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,320
public encryption scheme from based on

836
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,239
isogenys and this came this game

837
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,719
which is built on a trapdoor one-way

838
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,119
function inspired by the vegetation

839
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,199
points attack we also

840
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
propose

841
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,040
the first parameters for sheta and the

842
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,359
first implementation in the paper we

843
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,918
also introduced a new uber isogenic

844
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,839
assumption to encompass all hydrogen

845
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,159
based assumptions

846
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,239
so let's start with the tortion point

847
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,000
attack on sidh so in sids

848
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
the key recovery problem is not really

849
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,760
the pure isolation problem but it is the

850
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
computational super singular isogenic

851
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
problem with torsion point information

852
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,599
so you are given

853
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,119
two curves that are isolationist and you

854
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,200
are also given the action of the secret

855
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,359
isolate on some so some points and you

856
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,280
are asked to recover this secret

857
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,160
hydrogen one particularity in sidh is

858
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
that you are also given we also know the

859
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
anamorphism ring of the starting curve

860
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,880
this information is not trivial for a

861
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,119
random curve since the endomorphism ring

862
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,240
problem is known to be to be hard

863
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
so the pt attack the idea in the pt

864
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
attack is to find a suitable anamorphism

865
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,119
of the starting curve such that

866
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,280
this equation holds and with this

867
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
information you can now recover the

868
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,760
secret isolation phi a in polynomial

869
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
time given that the order of the torsion

870
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,880
points n b is greater than b times the

871
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
degree of the hydrogen

872
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,680
transfer curve occurs for which you know

873
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
the anamorphism ring and you have a less

874
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
imbalancedness between the hydrogenated

875
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,079
degree and

876
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,079
the torsion points and with this strand

877
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,839
up with this straddle curve what you

878
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,440
have is in fact that you have the

879
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,480
trapdoor a trapdoor mechanism

880
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
the one-way function here is just the

881
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,560
evaluation of the hydrogen the

882
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
computation of the hydrogen and the

883
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,960
evaluating it on top some points and the

884
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,599
trapdoor is disputable and the morphism

885
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,400
and

886
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
inverting the one-way function is just

887
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,800
running the peta note that the pt attack

888
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,520
is wrong only when you know the suitable

889
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
endomorphism and

890
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,680
the the integer the such that the

891
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,040
endomorphism satisfy satisfies this

892
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,200
equation

893
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
so we hands get a trapdoor mechanism and

894
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,280
with any trapdoor mechanism you can

895
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,079
build

896
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,920
uh trapdoor uh publicly inflation scheme

897
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,480
so what we do is that we suggest

898
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,599
the first

899
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,680
implementation of our scheme with some

900
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,960
concrete parameters

901
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,040
when doing the choice of parameters is a

902
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
bit it's not really trivial because

903
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,680
there are many constraints to satisfy

904
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,960
first is the same you have the

905
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,800
imbalances between the degrees of the

906
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,400
isolation and the

907
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
order of the torsion points the second

908
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,280
condition comes from the klpt which is

909
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,760
which the kpt algorithm which is used in

910
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,560
the in the key generation we also have

911
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,040
security requirements and lastly we have

912
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
different trade-offs between key

913
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,480
generation and

914
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
and encryption

915
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,560
and decryption we opt for the second

916
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,960
trade-off in which we have a reasonable

917
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
key generation algorithm but relatively

918
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,880
slow encryption and description we

919
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
suggest one parameter

920
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
for which we have a key generation that

921
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
runs in 10 hours encryption in four

922
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,760
seconds and description in about 10

923
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,640
minutes note that the slow the problem

924
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,320
with this key generation is that you

925
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
have a klpt algorithm running in it and

926
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,599
clt even though it is for normal time it

927
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,440
is still relatively slow in practice

928
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
in the paper we also introduced the

929
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
ibrahim assumption

930
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,720
that encompass most of hydrogen based

931
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
assumptions so when you are given the

932
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
quadratic order o and you consider the

933
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,359
set of curves with embeddings of this

934
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,040
quadratic order in to get into the

935
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,800
endomorphism ring of the curve then you

936
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
know that the class group

937
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
of this

938
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,880
quadratic order acts on the set fo on

939
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,400
this set on this set fo

940
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
here this is this problem is well known

941
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,400
since it is a problem underlying the

942
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,119
security of this class group action is

943
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,440
well known since it is what is used in

944
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,960
seaside and outside but when the n curve

945
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,040
when you are not given the the the

946
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,599
embedding of the order into the n curve

947
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,520
you have a different problem and it is

948
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
this problem that we call the

949
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,560
the o uber isogenic assumption so it is

950
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,800
in fact computing the class group action

951
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,359
when you are given the embedding of

952
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,520
the the order into the anamorphism ring

953
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,119
of the first curve but you are not given

954
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,880
the embedding of the order into the

955
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,760
anamorphism ring of the second curve

956
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
we argue that

957
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
all the assumptions in different

958
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,680
isolation-based schemes can be reduced

959
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
to these

960
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
uber hydrogenated assumptions especially

961
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,000
in seaside sidh shetter and

962
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,520
the computational super singular

963
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,200
hydrogen problem

964
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,640
so to conclude

965
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
in this paper we presented a new post

966
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
quantum secure encryption schemes empire

967
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,119
inspired by the torsion points attack we

968
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
propose parameters and we introduce a

969
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,920
new isolation assumption for future

970
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,359
directions we have

971
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,680
like possibilities to exploit

972
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
to explore the trade-offs in the

973
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,520
parameters choice

974
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,599
to improve on efficiency to understand

975
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,440
that to better understand the ubi's

976
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
assumption and to like cryptonize the

977
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,400
scheme

978
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,640
the paper is available on eprine thank

979
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,598
you for your attention

980
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,480
thank you boris are there any questions

981
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,319
we don't have any questions in zulip or

982
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,880
in the chat i think

983
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,000
i was just

984
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
wondering for this so by the way i

985
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,920
really like this uber assumption that's

986
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,200
really nice

987
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
um i was wondering there's a lot of

988
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,079
ongoing research and like improving

989
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,079
distortion point attacks and

990
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,800
improving klpt and things like that

991
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
the impact of such improvements on a

992
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,119
sita would that mainly be in terms of

993
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,440
efficiency or would there

994
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
be

995
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
um

996
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,119
yeah also some maybe security issues or

997
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,040
new constructions possible do you have

998
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,760
an eye on a view on that

999
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
um

1000
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,160
so

1001
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,160
the security of shita is oh well fine

1002
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,119
so the security of that is based on the

1003
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
computational super singularization with

1004
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
torsion point information

1005
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,800
so if the improvement still uses the

1006
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,200
anamorphism ring as input

1007
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,359
then this does not impact this normal

1008
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,280
affects the security of the scheme

1009
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
instead it will

1010
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,119
it will contribute to a more efficient

1011
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,760
scheme since it means you will be able

1012
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
you'll be able to choose smaller

1013
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,440
parameters that is you'll be able to

1014
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,920
choose a

1015
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,240
smaller

1016
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,240
pc

1017
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,800
okay it means you you'll be able you

1018
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
have a better equation here right

1019
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
because if you improve on the torsion

1020
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,599
points at that then you have a better

1021
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,160
equation hence you have you have less

1022
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
imbalance

1023
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,839
degrees n a and n b

1024
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,000
since you compute isolations of g and a

1025
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,839
and you have torsion points of order n b

1026
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,760
then you have more efficient schemes

1027
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,200
because you have your hydrogens will

1028
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,960
have shorter degrees and

1029
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,800
so forth

1030
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
so any improvement on the torsion points

1031
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,440
at that on the klpt algorithm will lead

1032
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,470
to a better efficiency

1033
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,910
[Music]

1034
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,960
okay the issues breaking points attacked

1035
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
with that requiring the knowledge of the

1036
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
anamorphism ring then then you clear

1037
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,560
your brain

1038
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,079
yeah let's see

1039
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,480
yeah thank you

1040
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,720
okay

1041
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,680
all right thinks there is i guess there

1042
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,280
is no more

1043
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,760
questions

1044
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,079
we can move on to

1045
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,640
the next to the last talk of the

1046
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,200
next and to the last talk of the session

1047
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
and

1048
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,640
this is the work of the subset of the

1049
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,040
authors from the previous work

1050
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,960
and it's again a

1051
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
public encryption scheme as urgently

1052
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,119
based the talk will be presented by

1053
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,640
boris fossa

1054
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
boris can you share your second yeah

1055
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,800
sure

1056
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,240
i'm searching for this

1057
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,359
yes it's okay okay

1058
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,520
how is it now okay

1059
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
can you see my screen

1060
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
we can see a screen and open question

1061
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,640
slide

1062
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,040
right

1063
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,359
you can make it full screen

1064
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,440
sure is it okay now

1065
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
perfect yes thank you

1066
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,200
right so

1067
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,760
the last but not but not least talk of

1068
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,440
the session is

1069
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,200
okay i can never pronounce the acronyms

1070
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,040
for misogyny basis

1071
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,480
it's uh

1072
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,119
let me try it's s heels

1073
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,720
and

1074
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,520
shields and heels shields and heels

1075
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,319
right

1076
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,640
shields and heels exogenous based pk is

1077
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,119
from equal radiation methods method for

1078
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,880
sidh the joint work of boris forza and

1079
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
christopher petit boris go ahead

1080
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,240
thank you again elena for the

1081
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,599
introduction

1082
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,599
yeah it's me again and

1083
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,119
so

1084
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,280
in fact the in s

1085
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
in s super singularization you feel

1086
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
money using super singular hydrogenase

1087
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,960
and

1088
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
super singularizations are not unknown

1089
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,599
to not commute in general so in sidh

1090
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,560
what

1091
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,839
they feel and

1092
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,920
zhao do they they introduce torsion

1093
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,760
points to make the diagram commute

1094
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
because sidh is a different one type key

1095
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,079
exchange distortion points have have

1096
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
been used in different attacks among

1097
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,040
which the pt attack and reserve

1098
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,880
improvement and

1099
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,079
most famously the gpsc attack in 2016

1100
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,000
and very recently

1101
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,360
a new adaptive attack

1102
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,510
[Music]

1103
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,839
this

1104
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,160
transform implies key disclosure and

1105
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,000
re-encryption and irre-encryption is

1106
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,960
used as evaluation method in this scheme

1107
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,560
there have been other countermeasures to

1108
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,280
the gps adaptive attacks such as k-side

1109
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
and the recent proof of hazard nourish

1110
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,560
by defeo and kubotos both counter

1111
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,760
measures are costly and the keys are are

1112
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,240
very large so in this paper what we do

1113
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
is that we propose a new counter measure

1114
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,680
to the gps adaptive attack and we

1115
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,079
incorporate this countermeasure into an

1116
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,240
interactive key exchange protocol we

1117
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
also derived two inc tca

1118
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,760
finance cpa pkes shields and hills with

1119
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,440
conjecture and cca security

1120
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,680
so let's look at sids and the gps t

1121
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,880
identifier

1122
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,079
so s-i-d-h is d-d-film and key exchange

1123
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,560
in which you publish the images of some

1124
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
torsion points through your

1125
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,079
secretizations

1126
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,560
in 2016 gpst galbraith beginning they

1127
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,880
prove that when you are given access to

1128
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,720
a key exchange oracle you can

1129
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,599
progressively recover the bids of this

1130
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,359
of alpha which is used to generate the

1131
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,480
kernel of your secret isogen

1132
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,640
and this is done through manipulating

1133
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,480
the torsion points you include in your

1134
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,839
in your public key so instead of

1135
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,839
returning if the curve a b phi b of p a

1136
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,280
and phi b of q a you return a b r i and

1137
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,920
s i where r i and s i are maliciously

1138
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,400
computed and that will help you to learn

1139
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,079
a bit of the secret of the secret alpha

1140
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,720
so here countering this

1141
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,160
this this attack means like describe a

1142
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,319
mechanism for which that can describe a

1143
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,160
mechanism that can enable at least to

1144
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,440
check if the torsion points in the

1145
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,280
public key were

1146
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,359
honestly computed or at least are

1147
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,400
harmless to her secret isolation

1148
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,640
so the idea of our encounter measure is

1149
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,079
as follows in fact in sidh when you use

1150
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,319
value formulas the hydrogen is commute

1151
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,880
so if you compose this equation you can

1152
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
see microsoft right

1153
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,760
okay so if you compute if you compose

1154
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,800
this equation by a dual of phi a dash

1155
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,760
then you get 2 to the a times 5 b equals

1156
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,480
to phi a dash dual composed with 5 b

1157
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,280
dash composed with phi a this implies

1158
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,440
that if alice can magically compute the

1159
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
right hand side of this equation then

1160
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,800
she can recompute

1161
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,480
the torsion points of both since she

1162
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
will be able to compute 5b 2 to the 8

1163
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,760
times 5b

1164
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,560
but

1165
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,119
at least you is using torsion points of

1166
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,200
order 2 to the a so in this equation if

1167
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,520
you plug in points of order 2 to the a

1168
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,400
then

1169
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
you have this factor of this two to the

1170
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
a factor that suggests that you will

1171
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,599
kill your points in fact without

1172
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,880
verifying if

1173
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,119
the equation holds so in the quantum

1174
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,880
measure what we do is that we use points

1175
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,960
of order two to the two a

1176
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,880
such that the equation will hold on

1177
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,079
points of order to the a so you have phi

1178
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,400
b of p equals to five b of two to the a

1179
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,839
p two

1180
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,160
on the right hand side so this is the

1181
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,240
idea of the counter measure now this

1182
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,800
supposes that we honestly compute 5b

1183
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,280
dash why would bob compute 5b dash

1184
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,920
honestly if we come back to the

1185
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,480
inside yes you see that 5b dash is the

1186
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
push forward of 5b through the secret

1187
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,240
isogenify a of alice so in order to

1188
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
include some maliciousness in five

1189
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,720
videos that this maliciousness cancels

1190
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,440
the malaysia is not included in 5b but

1191
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
we sort of need to know the action of at

1192
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,119
least quotient point of alice

1193
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,920
secretization sorry on the torsion

1194
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,720
points pa and qa

1195
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,559
but this information is equivalent to

1196
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,839
knowing alice secretly so since bob does

1197
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,680
not know this information then all he

1198
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,760
needs to do it all he can do is compute

1199
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,079
five meters honestly if not he will like

1200
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,920
mess up with the

1201
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,640
key validation

1202
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,480
so with this

1203
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,520
we get a new key validation in which

1204
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,200
bob will also need to reveal the action

1205
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,280
of 5b dash on some torsion points at

1206
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,040
least also we need to map

1207
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,119
some torsion points through a secret a

1208
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,760
second secret hydrogenate and use the

1209
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,680
previous ideas in the in the key

1210
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,119
validation to check that the torsion

1211
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,880
points were nicely generated

1212
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
we then incorporate this countermeasure

1213
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,720
into an interactive key exchange his

1214
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,960
site and derive to public encryption

1215
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
schemes shields and heals

1216
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,200
the idea in hillside

1217
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,480
is just to incorporate this

1218
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,640
countermeasure into a key exchange so

1219
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,440
what we need to reveal the 0.5 b dash of

1220
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,480
r a and 5 b dash of s a but he cannot

1221
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,640
reveal these points in clear because

1222
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,040
they are points on the shared curve so

1223
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
what he will do is that he will

1224
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,359
generate a canonical basis on this

1225
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,280
shared curve and compute the coordinates

1226
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,839
of these points in the canonical basis

1227
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,200
hence we get an interactive exchange

1228
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
one thing to note here is that the ddh

1229
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
type assumption for the key exchange

1230
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,559
does not hold because you are revealing

1231
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,359
some causing it on of points on the

1232
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,960
shared curve but the computational

1233
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,119
difference assumption we believe is

1234
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,559
still is

1235
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,520
it still holds

1236
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,160
the idea in shields and hills is that to

1237
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,240
encrypt message m you just scale the

1238
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,680
points 5 b dash of r a and 5 b dash of s

1239
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,920
a by some integer and alice can then

1240
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,000
recover this message by solving some

1241
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,160
distribution after the key variation

1242
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,760
the difference between shields and hills

1243
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,000
is that in shields you use the frames of

1244
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
hillside while in shields you you in

1245
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,920
shoes you use the prince of shield side

1246
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,040
of hillside sorry why in heels you use

1247
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,280
smaller primes in shields here you what

1248
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,839
you notice is that both can both include

1249
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,680
messages and decrypt

1250
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,839
with the same parameters why in his book

1251
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,160
and encrypt that he cannot decrypt

1252
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:18,960
this

1253
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,000
this may lead to some advantages

1254
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,440
i believe the speaker is having some

1255
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,520
internet issues and has frozen or is it

1256
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,599
just my connection the same for me

1257
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,319
a session is not a good session on this

1258
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,319
asia crypt if it doesn't have technical

1259
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,640
issues

1260
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,720
yes i think you're correct at this point

1261
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,880
yeah yeah we have your back can you

1262
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
please reshare your slides

1263
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,280
yes yes internet is the only thing i

1264
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,720
could not test before starting the

1265
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,319
the presentation

1266
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,880
i don't know when i stopped

1267
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,920
uh

1268
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,760
yeah you stopped right here when you

1269
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,520
when you said that both cannot and then

1270
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,680
you'll then you

1271
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,359
then discover

1272
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,480
okay

1273
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,000
thank you

1274
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,359
so

1275
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,200
we prove that can you hear me is it okay

1276
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,520
okay thank you so we proved that shields

1277
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,559
and hills are inc is icp secure but we

1278
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,960
could not come up with an icca

1279
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,280
security proof but we argue that there

1280
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,200
is to the best of our knowledge there is

1281
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,839
no known ancient attack on the on the

1282
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,400
two schemes

1283
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,559
so

1284
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,839
here we compare heat side and k side

1285
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,920
which is the

1286
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,359
the convenient

1287
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,960
counter measure to which we could

1288
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,480
compare since there is

1289
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,800
there is no no key disclosure and we see

1290
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,559
that we gain a lot of we have a lot of

1291
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,760
improvement

1292
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,920
with respect to ksi know that there is

1293
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,040
also the

1294
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,200
recent proof of vision knowledge

1295
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,559
that appeared

1296
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,720
some months ago on april

1297
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,760
and

1298
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,400
we also the the our counter measure is

1299
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,079
also better than that performance

1300
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,680
knowledge but note that in the proof of

1301
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,119
visual knowledge you also prove the

1302
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,640
knowledge of you also prove the

1303
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,880
correctness of the degree of the isogeny

1304
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,960
which is not the case in our in our

1305
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,680
counter measure

1306
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,839
so the schemes shields and hills they

1307
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,559
are still very slow compared to

1308
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,520
side

1309
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,480
and also they they have larger keys they

1310
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,200
have

1311
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,599
they have a larger keys but we believe

1312
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,520
that they will obey the god bless the to

1313
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,280
gilbreat's law and that maybe in 10

1314
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
years you have

1315
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,240
something more efficient

1316
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,079
so as open questions we have

1317
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,559
cryptanalysis it's new and the scheme

1318
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,440
sorry needs skipped analysis

1319
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,599
we have the key validation method also

1320
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,559
maybe

1321
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,280
we can improve it and we are currently

1322
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,359
what we are actively working on it and

1323
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,280
proving or contradicting the inca

1324
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,240
security of shields and hills is also an

1325
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,839
open problem

1326
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,760
one last comment

1327
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,480
so we have noticed so few days ago we

1328
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,240
noticed a minor is a minor issue in the

1329
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,160
counter measure it does not affect the

1330
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,480
security of the skin but i think it's

1331
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,119
just it's meant to be corrected and you

1332
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,640
correct that in the follow-up version of

1333
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,440
the of the countermeasure

1334
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,520
so thanks very much and

1335
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,800
that's it for me

1336
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,240
thank you boris

1337
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,359
are there any questions

1338
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,640
so no questions

1339
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,520
yeah

1340
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,599
sorry no question no question in the in

1341
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
the zoom chat

1342
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,359
no um neither uh there are questions in

1343
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,079
the

1344
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,040
zulu chat i may have a question for

1345
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,359
boris so you mentioned this uh commuting

1346
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,599
of videos formerly

1347
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,920
um so i guess that's true for the

1348
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,319
original formula for by villain but is

1349
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,720
it also true for like uh the more

1350
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,000
efficient

1351
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,599
versions that have proposed in the

1352
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,079
meantime how dependent are you on this

1353
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,440
assumption

1354
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,839
i think it's true i believe at least for

1355
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,040
implementation is true right okay yeah

1356
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,800
verified implementation is true

1357
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,880
and so you

1358
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,640
like in the heels you have this

1359
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,280
unbalancedness i think if i understand

1360
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,960
that or do you always have it maybe i

1361
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,640
misunderstood

1362
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,000
uh

1363
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,559
so this comes with some security issues

1364
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,799
then or uh

1365
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,720
yes

1366
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,559
that's a very nice question since i did

1367
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,440
not mention it in this presentation so

1368
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,280
you are computing hydrogenates of degree

1369
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,720
two to the a and you are revealing the

1370
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
actions on torsion points of

1371
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,119
order three to the two b so it's in

1372
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,640
balance so

1373
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,680
the counter

1374
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,079
we said the starting the endomorphism

1375
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,599
ring of the starting curve to be unknown

1376
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,559
so you need a trusted setup for the

1377
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,480
for the schemes yeah thank you very much

1378
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,839
for that for bringing up that question

1379
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,920
thank you very much

1380
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,480
okay thank you

1381
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,319
let me finish the session with the

1382
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,480
question that you boris brought up

1383
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
yourself according to the galbraith's

1384
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,520
law

1385
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,119
what do you think will be faster in 10

1386
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,000
years as argeniza lattices

1387
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,920
ah

1388
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,359
i think that's

1389
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,520
a question for which we can you already

1390
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,839
know the answer maybe it's hard to to

1391
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,559
like to say that israeli would beat that

1392
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,160
thesis

1393
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,559
someday i don't know but

1394
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,079
maybe if you have like a square root

1395
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,400
formula for isolation of degree two and

1396
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,319
three then

1397
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,520
then then you can expect that but it's

1398
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,680
really not i think it would be very

1399
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,440
optimistic to say that isolates will

1400
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,400
beat the thesis in terms of efficiency

1401
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,680
but the the the the power of izone is

1402
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,400
that they are very flexible right there

1403
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,160
they are very flexible and they have

1404
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,000
there is a lot of structures a lot of

1405
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,839
structure in hydrogen is which you can

1406
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:19,040
really exploit i think

1407
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,760
all right that was more a joke question

1408
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,559
but

1409
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,839
thanks a lot

1410
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,240
thanks for sharing your opinion and

1411
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,839
if there is no further questions or

1412
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,000
comments i think we should thank all the

1413
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,319
participants of the

1414
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,200
of the session and the speakers

1415
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,799
and i think with this

1416
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,640
thank you everyone for attending

1417
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,920
and

1418
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,760
we can close the session

1419
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,920
thank you
