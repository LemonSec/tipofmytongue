1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,639
all right please begin

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,080
okay so um uh hello everyone so we are

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,040
delighted uh to have the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,240
the first uh invited talk uh of this

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
conference

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,240
aside from yesterday's talk which was a

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,560
distinguished lecture so a bit different

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,760
um

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,279
so

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,080
so

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
we are very happy to have

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
professor sacco

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,880
from

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,800
uh wasted university

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,079
um we'll talk about uh cryptography for

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,160
secure privacy respecting and fair

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,360
society

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
what more can we do

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,160
so

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,570
um professor sacco was a

21
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,840
[Music]

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
researcher for nec

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,719
for a long time she's a long-time member

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,920
of the

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
of the iscr community

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,239
in particular she

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,680
especially the

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
asia crypt community

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
she has been program co-chair

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,959
for

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,360
many isr and other

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,640
conferences

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
and

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
including rrwc uh recently um um a

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,479
member of the rwc steering committee

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
recently

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,720
um

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,799
and uh in japan um he has she has had a

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
number of um

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
um uh

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
government-related uh responsibility so

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560
uh responsibilities in various

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
government committees uh for um

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,759
um identity privacy uh authentication so

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,920
on so um concrete uh application

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
uh of um

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,799
um

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
applied cryptography in um

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,640
the real world in some sense and so

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
this will be very related uh to the

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,360
invited talk should we give today

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
so

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
very happy very honored to have you

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
professor sacco and the floor is yours

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
thank you very much for the kind

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,000
introduction

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
i am very happy to have this opportunity

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
to talk to you at asia crypt 2021

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
and asia crypt 2021 is very special

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
because

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,840
of that's about 30 years ago back in

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
1991

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
that was the first time

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
a conference titled asia crypt was held

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
so this is 30 years anniversary sort of

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
for a conference titled aja crypt

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,239
and

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
that was held in japan

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
and if you look closely

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
under the organizing committee you will

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,519
find my maiden night name kiziri tanaka

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
from nec

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
so

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,159
uh

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
i was very enthusiastic

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,560
to have this egyptrip 91 happening in

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
japan for the first time

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
and

79
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,959
me at that time i

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
did not accept

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
expect me after 30 years will be talking

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,519
to you like this in the same conference

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
is your crypt

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
so today

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,480
as maddy said i will be talking about

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
what cryptography can do for our society

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
and

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,480
all these 30 years

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,519
i

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
strongly believe

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
that cryptographic protocols are

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,760
designed to bring more security

93
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,599
privacy and fairness to society

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
and today i would like to share with you

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
my journey so far

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
trying to achieve and accomplish this

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
goal

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,480
and actually this talk

99
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,400
is more intended to talk to students

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
learning cryptography

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
to tell them

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
that there are so many anticipation from

103
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
society to you

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,839
and you have

105
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
lots of things to do

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,639
after learning cryptography

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,080
so uh

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
it there will be this is not a technical

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
talk and

110
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
i don't think you will see any math in

111
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,240
my presentation today

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,239
so my journey so far

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
well as you can see i'm in this field

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
for more than 30 years

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,080
and my first

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
try

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,639
uh

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
being in a company

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
called nec

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,000
what i did in their in their project for

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
the first time was implementing rsa

122
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,880
cryptosystem

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
using a special processor called digital

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
signal processor

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
so

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,840
you have to bring yourself back to more

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
than 30 years ago

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
that time computers were very slow

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,880
and for rsa of like 512 bits long

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
took very long

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
if i remember the figures correctly it

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
was like an hour for a personal computer

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
to do the job

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
so uh there weren't any applications of

135
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
public key cryptography

136
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
and people

137
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,080
read and learned about rsa crypticism

138
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,320
they loved it but they sort of think

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
thought it as a dream it would be nice

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,919
if we come

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
true someday

142
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
but with this uh dsp that i

143
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
uh designed

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,639
now uh

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
i i think it computed uh rsa

146
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
cryptosystem

147
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,960
of

148
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,440
512 orbits in

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,880
several seconds so that's really

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
good compared to

151
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
hours

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
so uh and they used it in an ac's

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
product

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
uh and that was for prepaid card

155
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,240
so at that time remember 40 years ago uh

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,039
prepaid cards were worth something

157
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
around 10

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
because it was easy to

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,560
modify the amount so they have to keep

160
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
the amount limit law

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
but they wanted to have this

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,080
prepaid card used in other

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,280
applications well so if it was phone

164
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
call yes maybe you would not lose much

165
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
if this card was uh

166
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
was misused but

167
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,039
they wanted to have

168
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,080
more

169
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,880
prepaid card with larger amount and for

170
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,840
example they wanted to use the card that

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
could be worth a hundred dollars uh

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,520
intact in writing a taxi or

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,599
or shopping or

174
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,759
eating at restaurant

175
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,720
so

176
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
uh the my first project with nec was to

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
uh to secure the remaining amount in

178
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
prepaid card using rsa signature

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
and all the taxi meters

180
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,400
of our client had this dsp inside so

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
they can check the correctness of the

182
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
prepaid card

183
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,960
and

184
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
so that was my first success story

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
and what

186
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,599
the the what i really liked was i i

187
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,039
walked in the town and i saw people

188
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
using the prepaid card that i developed

189
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
and they were enjoying it so that was my

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
first experience that indeed having

191
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
crypt secure cryptography module inside

192
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
people can benefit and enjoy

193
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
a new product

194
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,479
and new services

195
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
so and after that i

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
uh had some i worked on electronic

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
voting protocols i have some papers at

198
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,199
crypto and eurocrypt on voting protocols

199
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,240
again i i did not want to finish it just

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
as a paper but i wanted to implement it

201
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
so people can

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
use voting protocols that uses a mixed

203
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,799
network

204
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,080
so i again this was another

205
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
sort of success story

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
that i

207
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,040
did implement them

208
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
uh and they were uh ndc's labor union

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
used it for a law by binding voting

210
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,440
system because labor union uh we have a

211
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,160
law saying that you have to do a

212
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,920
legitimate voting to reflect every uh

213
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,720
every uh member's voice to uh like uh

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,000
elect their president or change their

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
rules

216
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
or

217
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
collect the straight credit

218
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,839
so uh i think that was in early uh

219
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,959
2000 uh they started using it and the

220
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
the labor union had like 20 000 voters

221
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
and

222
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
it i i i have not been told they stopped

223
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
using it so uh they are still using the

224
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
system for

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
uh

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
i think more

227
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,040
close to 20 years now

228
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,279
well so uh

229
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
this was a

230
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
a big experience to me because

231
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
uh the issue yes the voting

232
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,480
protocol was regarded to be very slow at

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
that time so making it faster was one of

234
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
the things we tried

235
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
but many difficult issues

236
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,399
laid outside the protocol

237
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
for example how to authenticate voters

238
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
which pki are we going to use uh if if

239
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
they want to implement voting protocols

240
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,399
uh voting system but if the employees

241
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
did not have pki

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,040
uh

243
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
they could not use it and that was a big

244
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
obstacle

245
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,920
in spreading this kind of system

246
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
and there were some

247
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
uh problems regarding the key management

248
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
for the mixers where they should be able

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
to

250
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
have correct keys corresponding to the

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
public keys but

252
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,920
uh yeah that that was a difficult part

253
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
and then uh

254
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
my journey late 2000

255
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,839
uh i

256
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,880
i

257
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
i did more implementation of voting

258
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
systems in real world

259
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
and one of the experience

260
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
was i uh

261
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,519
i

262
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
implemented this voting system for a

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,480
young researcher award within this

264
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
annual domestic crypto security

265
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
conference in japan called scis

266
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
where this is a big conference

267
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
we have each year like

268
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
three or 600 or 800

269
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
voters

270
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
and then the first electronic voting

271
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,680
using mixnet was performed in 2008.

272
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
before that we were doing the

273
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
paper-based

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,680
voting for this young researcher award

275
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
so

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
so probably you would guess if we wanted

277
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,440
to have a real rigorous

278
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
voting system used in this size of a

279
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,639
community

280
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,880
the operation becomes more complex

281
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
and

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
so uh

283
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
i thought i should ditch some of the

284
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
experience i had which i think i

285
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
mentioned some of them already

286
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,839
uh well

287
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
so

288
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
maybe cryptographers or people working

289
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,720
on voting system would know what's the

290
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
risk what's the requirement on voting

291
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,720
system but people in general even though

292
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
they're engaged in the security

293
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
conferences

294
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,120
of voters didn't believe their voted

295
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,519
secret vote i mean they didn't really

296
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,720
care much

297
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
about the secrecy of vote

298
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
and because in order to

299
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
avoid

300
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
duplicate votes we had we asked them to

301
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
authenticate themselves so they would

302
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,160
took for grant uh granted that uh that

303
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,079
that was not encrypted and then the

304
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,200
server knows the vote

305
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
and actually voters does not care much

306
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
about the correctness of the tally so

307
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
even though we prepared the verification

308
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
software for verifying the zero

309
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
knowledge proof that the tally is

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,920
correct and not much people cared about

311
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,519
it

312
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
and the key management

313
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
uh there was a big issue where

314
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,760
uh

315
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
they had

316
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
two set of uh decryption key and a

317
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
public key and the first decryption of

318
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
first pair was used for test and then

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
the second was for the real

320
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,760
but they sort of swore that's worded

321
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,440
and after the real voting uh when they

322
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,279
tried to decode it they couldn't decode

323
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
it correctly because they only kept the

324
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,600
decryption key for the test

325
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
session

326
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
so we did the voting again

327
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
and there this the the key management so

328
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,639
uh in this scis voting system it was

329
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,000
voluntary professors who served as a

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
mixer to guarantee the rigorousness that

331
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
these professors are not colluding

332
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,959
so

333
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,000
so i asked them to do the setup uh but

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
the the professor forgot

335
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
to well they did the setup but they just

336
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,079
deleted all the files they had in their

337
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,199
computer

338
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,560
so the the decryption was key was lost

339
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
so we had to set up uh

340
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,440
everything again so

341
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
how to manage the keys it's it's really

342
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,480
difficult for usual people to understand

343
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
and then the last thing uh this is the

344
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
sad story

345
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,800
but after trying this electronic voting

346
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
in scis for

347
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
i think around five times

348
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,680
then the organizers got

349
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,480
uh

350
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,399
really tired of

351
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
organizing it uh a rigorous procedure

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
for electronic voting

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
and they said oh why don't we use this

354
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
cloud system and let them count the vote

355
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,279
and

356
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,600
you know we trust the cloud

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,399
so they stopped using it

358
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
so uh

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
yes it's it's really difficult to find

360
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
the need uh what these people really

361
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,240
need uh want uh by implementing the

362
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
voting system

363
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
maybe they didn't care much

364
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,040
about the

365
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
privacy

366
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
they just stress the cloud and that that

367
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
could have been enough

368
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,160
so after going through uh

369
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,040
implementation of voting system

370
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,959
uh so this is here around of 2005

371
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
and if i look around

372
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,120
cryptography especially

373
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
uh symmetric keys or uh or the

374
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,440
uh

375
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
the secret key and

376
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,240
encryption system are used

377
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
very much

378
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,399
but public key cryptography was not

379
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,079
being used

380
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,720
maybe for a single system like voting

381
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,519
system we tried hard but people

382
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
thought it was too complex

383
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
and then the only two

384
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
examples that i could see in the

385
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,759
surroundings was using public key in ssl

386
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
tls and pki

387
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
but as you know those days we had a lot

388
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,360
of fancy crypto protocols in the

389
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
literature

390
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
and

391
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,360
my

392
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
next challenge

393
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,720
was how can we have more people enjoying

394
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
the benefit of public key crypto

395
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
cryptography

396
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
like group signatures

397
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
i i really like group signatures it has

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
a nice balance between security and

399
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
privacy

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
so

401
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,079
i really

402
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,640
fought hard how can how can i make it

403
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
happen

404
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
so my first approach was maybe we need a

405
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,439
good business application for group

406
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,839
signatures so people would like to use

407
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,039
uh

408
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
i think all of you know what group

409
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,360
signature is uh it's a system where a

410
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
user can prove its membership of a group

411
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
that they belong to a certain group

412
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
but without

413
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
identifying themselves revealing which

414
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
member or the membership id or anything

415
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
like that

416
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,240
and uh it's it's a good balance between

417
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,960
security and privacy because you now

418
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,600
enjoy the privacy but if something bad

419
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
happens uh there is a designated opener

420
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
who can revoke the anonymity and

421
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
identify exactly who you are

422
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,240
so i try to explain this to

423
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,360
many of my customers and clients and

424
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,640
people around me and this is how i try

425
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
to explain

426
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,120
so the group signature is

427
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,919
it's

428
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
it it gives it it is the same string of

429
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
data that can mean different things to

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
different people

431
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
for verifier this string

432
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,240
means a confirmation of a membership

433
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
and doesn't tell more

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
and for opener

435
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
the the same string gives you the

436
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,960
identifier of the user

437
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
right so

438
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,880
you have one string and that means

439
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,360
different things to different person

440
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
so with that how do you want to use it

441
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,760
in your business

442
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
so uh

443
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
oh the first business application

444
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
is the credit card scenario

445
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
where this alice has a credit card and

446
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
this verifier at a store he can check

447
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
that this is a valid card but without

448
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
knowing more details about the credit

449
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
card number

450
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
so he cannot misuse alice's credit card

451
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,760
but if you go if this the same string

452
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,720
that was transformed from uh transferred

453
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,919
from the shop to the credit card company

454
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
now uh it's it's the opener and this

455
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,039
credit card company can identify alice

456
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
and can

457
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
can pay the amount alice paid and

458
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
send the bill to alice so i thought this

459
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
was a fantastic

460
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,360
scenario for using group signatures

461
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,400
another scenario i thought was

462
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,280
in library scenario so alice wants to

463
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
borrow a book and librarian wants to

464
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,039
make sure if she is a registered member

465
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
of this library

466
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
and if she returns the book in time the

467
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,600
librarian does not have to know who

468
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,120
borrowed this book

469
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,039
but maybe if there is a overdue book uh

470
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,919
there is a manager at the library and

471
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,200
only she

472
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
can be an opener and identify who has

473
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
the overdue book

474
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
okay

475
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,600
so and there's another scenario it's a

476
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,440
passport scenario and whenever i travel

477
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,080
when i go to hotel this hotel kirk's

478
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,960
clerk says uh show me your passport and

479
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,360
they will take a photocopy of it

480
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
but do they really have to know my

481
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
passport number before anything happened

482
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,559
so maybe i can use group signature so

483
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,880
that this hotel knows that i have a

484
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,080
valid passport issued by japanese uh

485
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
government

486
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,840
and if something bad happens or i didn't

487
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,400
pay the hotel bill or something

488
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
they can go to the japanese embassy who

489
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,440
can be an opener and identify myself

490
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
and then the last scenario is not really

491
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,120
alice but in car scenario when cars are

492
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
talking to each other like i'm turning

493
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
left or right or breaking or those kind

494
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
of message and someone

495
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
some car next to it is going to get the

496
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
message so that they won't hit each

497
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,840
other but when something bad happens

498
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,080
there could be an opening to identify

499
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,799
which car was running where

500
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,200
so i came up with many

501
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
uh different scenarios and hoping

502
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,799
someone get interested and trying to use

503
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,520
it

504
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
so

505
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
how well did i do

506
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,240
so the credit card scenario i was told

507
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,480
okay so it's a nice protocol nice

508
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
feature but we already have set

509
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,440
sct that does this job right

510
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,039
okay so that sort of did it

511
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,440
and then the library scenario i really

512
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
went up to one of uh nic's customer

513
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
who is

514
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,799
doing the video rental

515
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,600
and then what they said was oh do we

516
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
have to set up a new server for this

517
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
manager and this

518
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
librarian oh that would be

519
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
too expensive so

520
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,320
that threw away my idea

521
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
and then the passport scenario

522
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
uh icao

523
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,760
uh

524
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,400
already had a pass

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,520
the standard to do the identification

526
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,480
and

527
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
i could not sneak this kind of

528
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
signature in

529
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,760
and

530
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
the last scenario

531
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,080
i thought okay credit card

532
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,799
company has a long history and so is

533
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,240
passport so in car scenario and when we

534
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,480
are talking about something

535
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
new feature to cars like electronic

536
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,600
vehicle cars uh vehicles

537
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,440
uh if it's a brand new then there might

538
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
be a chance for me to sneak this kind of

539
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
group signature algorithm in the

540
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
standardization

541
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,440
and

542
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
so uh they said okay let's work on a

543
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
standard great so actually

544
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,200
uh i did work on this uh electronic

545
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
vehicle to great communication interface

546
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,760
uh standardize that iso

547
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
8 in 2013

548
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
and talked to them how these well it was

549
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,080
not really car to car communication it's

550
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,240
the electronic vehicle

551
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
that wants to charge

552
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
the power to the car and how do they

553
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,200
authenticate themselves to the the grid

554
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,039
company or the power company

555
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,000
so and then they they really cared about

556
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,720
privacy they did not want

557
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,919
these power companies to trace the car

558
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,400
when they uh charge

559
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
energy in paris and they move to a

560
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,640
different city in europe all the way to

561
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
italy or you know they don't want to be

562
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
traced

563
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
uh

564
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,279
so

565
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,159
there i had an opportunity but

566
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
unfortunately because they wanted to

567
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,320
implement today they did not want to

568
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
have a new

569
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,000
new algorithm

570
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,640
that no one implemented before in their

571
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,600
cards

572
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,279
so they just used an ordinary pk public

573
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,840
key encryption

574
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
so

575
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,320
so i

576
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,000
so far i was not able to find any good

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
business application

578
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
so uh

579
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
and then i thought what else i could do

580
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
and when i look at the success of pki

581
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,679
i

582
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
saw that now these are

583
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,120
these tips computing rsa is now so

584
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,720
tiny and small they could be embedded in

585
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,559
tips like uh

586
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,600
this

587
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
card

588
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,400
so maybe

589
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
we would need a fast hardware that

590
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,720
computes group signature so that

591
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
a

592
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
card can compute a group signature

593
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
inside the card

594
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
so what i did

595
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,960
so this is my slide back in 2010

596
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
when i gave talk in this

597
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
workshop

598
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,240
so

599
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,720
i i i reported i we developed

600
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,600
uh the world first to our knowledge lsi

601
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480
for group signatures where inside the

602
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
tip they have all the con all the

603
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,640
accelerators for ecc and rsa and hash

604
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,120
functions in a in a very small tip

605
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,080
okay

606
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
so

607
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
and even though

608
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
we had a tip

609
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,840
lsi

610
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,799
uh

611
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,760
we didn't fly either

612
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,640
so

613
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
i have to think of other ways

614
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,039
how can i

615
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
make people

616
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,960
enjoy this beauty of group signatures

617
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,000
and then

618
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
then my next approach

619
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,039
was about standardization

620
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
well uh when i

621
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,799
when i first went to this credit card

622
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,640
company sct was a standardized protocol

623
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,120
and also for the passport there is a

624
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
standardization

625
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,679
and i also began standardizing in this

626
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,000
electronic vehicle to grid

627
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,720
uh conversation so maybe

628
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
i should be standardizing group

629
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,200
signature the basic group signature

630
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,559
protocol in a more um

631
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,279
more general

632
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,240
standardization body

633
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
so what i did

634
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
was i

635
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,120
i joined this uh iso iec jtc1

636
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
27

637
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,880
group where they worked on information

638
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
security

639
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,799
and especially this working group five

640
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,960
this the mission for this working group

641
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,159
five was to work on identity management

642
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
and privacy so group signature would be

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,480
a best fit to this group

644
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
so

645
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,960
but it was really a different community

646
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,799
at the first time

647
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,919
so uh they use term

648
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,919
terminology that's

649
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,919
somewhat familiar

650
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
but uh they used it in a different

651
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
meaning

652
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,120
and identification authentication

653
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,000
authorization in credentials and

654
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,919
anonymity

655
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,000
so i i first

656
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,360
had a difficulty understanding what they

657
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,039
really meant

658
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
like credentials

659
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,080
and when i talked about group signatures

660
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,480
and said this is anonymous and they said

661
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,200
oh no you don't call this anonymous

662
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
so what it ended up

663
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
was the group signature was renamed to

664
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
be partially anonymous partially

665
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,600
unlinkable authentication

666
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,240
it's okay as long as i could standardize

667
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,520
it and uh in

668
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,320
2012

669
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,200
this

670
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,799
standardization document number 29191

671
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
gives a framework

672
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,760
for

673
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,640
uh

674
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
doing this group signature scheme in

675
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,720
user authentication

676
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,520
and then uh this working group too who

677
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
is working on crypto mechanism uh also

678
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,600
came up with more detailed mechanisms

679
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,240
and algorithms for group signatures

680
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,559
and

681
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,039
what was

682
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
i i

683
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,039
even though i had a hard time at the

684
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,399
beginning

685
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,760
uh i i thought this activity was very

686
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,880
and

687
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,919
because uh for these follow following

688
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,159
four reasons

689
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,480
so i could meet people

690
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
who is looking for alternative solutions

691
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
so in this working group five people

692
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,159
were working on how to do identity

693
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,919
management uh well and protect people's

694
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,200
privacy so they were always looking uh

695
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,320
for

696
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,799
solutions that does it better

697
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,000
so when i first explained to them about

698
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320
this group signature and i still

699
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
remember this one of the members saying

700
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,159
what you're saying is too complicated

701
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,440
you're confusing me with

702
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,200
authentication and authorization and can

703
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
you explicitly say which party's

704
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
authentication and which is

705
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
authorization

706
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
right so uh

707
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,600
they had in mind that when you want to

708
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,360
do

709
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,640
authorization you first have to do the

710
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
identification

711
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
and authorization

712
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,279
sorry authentication and then

713
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,840
authorization

714
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,399
but group signature is a kind of a

715
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,520
module

716
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
that only gives

717
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
the group membership and that's

718
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,720
something like authentication that you

719
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
belong to a member but that's something

720
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
like authorization that some

721
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,039
group

722
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,080
has is authorized to do something so you

723
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
want to authorize that

724
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
so but uh

725
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
talking to someone who is

726
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,039
not your field really helped me to brush

727
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,279
up

728
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,640
i have

729
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
how should i explain the technology well

730
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,679
to the others so they can understand

731
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
and also uh

732
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,720
it helps me understand the technology

733
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,919
more because now you can think about how

734
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
people want to use group signatures and

735
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,000
they might want to use it for

736
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,880
authentication or authorization and i

737
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,279
should be able to speak the language so

738
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,519
that they can understand what this

739
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,320
technology is doing

740
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,960
and then the third point is uh

741
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,760
i can learn about related technologies

742
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
used in real world

743
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,760
so these people working on

744
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,519
standardization is really implementing

745
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,320
the real world identity management and

746
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,120
they really care for privacy so i could

747
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
learn about the current technologies

748
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,279
used used in identity management like

749
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,559
open id connect and all those things and

750
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,919
then i i am compelled to explain the

751
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,039
difference

752
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,039
between this kind of anonymous

753
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,880
authentication protocols and these uh

754
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,240
open id connect protocols that tries to

755
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,279
preserve a privacy for users

756
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,000
so i am still struggling with this uh

757
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,799
but it's a different model but i should

758
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,080
be able to explain the differences to

759
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,039
the people so that people can make right

760
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,039
decisions which they want to use

761
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,000
and what is good about standardizing

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,080
technology is that if we were successful

763
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,360
in making a developer friendly

764
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,000
specification

765
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,760
then there will be developers

766
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
writing codes

767
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
for the

768
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
for the technology and then people would

769
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,880
instantly use well

770
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,600
it's much easier for them to deploy

771
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,320
those kinds of technologies so

772
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,120
uh

773
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,559
i i think we

774
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,159
if we want to have our technologies

775
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
uh uh if we want to have more people

776
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,320
using our technology standardization

777
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
it's something we should carefully look

778
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,430
into and do it well

779
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,880
[Music]

780
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,360
okay so after all these journey i and

781
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,640
then i also did some consulting for uh

782
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,399
any uh for the products in nec so

783
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,480
i now have a lot of experiences what is

784
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,640
the good design and what is the bad

785
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,600
design and uh what are the things we

786
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,919
should be careful in advance when

787
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,919
designing those this kind of systems

788
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,799
so i was wondering

789
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
how can we share

790
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,159
these experiences and because i know i

791
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
had hard time designing the system that

792
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,320
these

793
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,399
users have very

794
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,960
peculiar requirements and i really tried

795
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,918
to meet up their requirement and i

796
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,079
wanted to share that and i also wanted

797
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,320
to learn from the others because they

798
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,119
have done it better than i did right so

799
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,320
i really wanted to find a place uh where

800
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
we can share this kind of experience

801
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,918
so that was the reason

802
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,440
i uh with aguilas quies i started a

803
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,918
workshop on real life cryptographic

804
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,320
protocols and standardization

805
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,800
so it's like i put two things that i'm

806
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,000
interested in to a name of the workshop

807
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
so how can we have uh cryptographic

808
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
protocols in real life and how we can do

809
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,639
it good in standardizing them so people

810
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,359
would use it

811
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,960
so uh this lasted uh for two years

812
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
and

813
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,320
uh and

814
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,640
and

815
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
it it

816
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
it

817
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,520
it didn't last and then i probably

818
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
because uh

819
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,760
maybe i'll i have it in the next slide

820
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,200
but i i still don't know how to make

821
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
this kind of workshop successful

822
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,040
and if you have any ideas i'll be very

823
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,800
happy to hear it

824
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
but um

825
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,359
i i hope i can

826
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,280
try to explain what i want to say in

827
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
this slide

828
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
but let's

829
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,359
say these yellow dots are examples of

830
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,440
some primitives like say a digital

831
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,800
signature scheme so if you look from the

832
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,520
efficiency and then the security there

833
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,320
are different kinds of digital signature

834
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,280
schemes that has been proposed

835
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
and

836
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,560
the way we are used to in evaluating the

837
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,280
new digital signature scheme

838
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,280
is that either it's more efficient than

839
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,560
the previous algorithms or is it more

840
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,599
secure

841
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,760
than the previous ones so those

842
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,000
those algorithms that comes

843
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,839
to here is easy to be accepted at a

844
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,440
conferences like asia crypt and pkc and

845
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,480
all those conferences

846
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,359
but

847
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
if you're thinking about implementing

848
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,839
for example digital signature it's not

849
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,200
uh they do not fall into the world best

850
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,000
efficiency or the world's best security

851
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,960
it could be somewhere lying in here

852
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,920
because of other requirements needed in

853
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
real life like there is a hardware

854
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,280
limitations or the development time

855
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,720
limitations

856
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,359
so even if we were trying to come up

857
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,320
with a good signature scheme that is

858
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,200
good for implementation it is hard to be

859
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,520
accepted in conferences because uh

860
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,640
it's

861
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,359
it's difficult to convey

862
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,359
why this

863
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,079
product algorithms falling

864
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,119
around here is worth publishing

865
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,760
and it's the mindset of the reviewers

866
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,359
also and but as as a as a community as a

867
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,240
whole uh we don't know and i i don't

868
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,920
know how to evaluate uh those signatures

869
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,800
that falls around here

870
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,680
and also when you're designing a crypto

871
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,720
system

872
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
you're it's the combination

873
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,079
of goods for example goods secret

874
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,240
sharing scheme or commitment schemes and

875
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,119
signature scheme and all of these

876
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,680
schemes need to be harmonized to meet

877
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,920
the specific use case

878
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,040
but also it's very hard to have this

879
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,079
kind of

880
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,440
paper in a conference because it's easy

881
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,160
to say it's just a combination of

882
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,320
non-technology and that is indeed true

883
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,200
but

884
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
uh when you're designing um

885
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,640
cryptosystems for the real world that's

886
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,240
what we are doing

887
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,560
every day and we are looking for the

888
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,119
best combination and there is no way to

889
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
evaluate which

890
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,520
combination was good over the other

891
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,320
combination and that kind of knowledge

892
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,520
it's something we need to collect uh

893
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,560
for the community community

894
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,440
so as i said uh i think uh we need

895
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,720
to learn how to write papers that

896
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,040
shares our experiences in designing

897
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,720
cryptosystems

898
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,000
and as a

899
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,119
reviewer community we need to

900
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,079
learn best practices or the best

901
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,680
criteria to evaluate those papers

902
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,160
which i think it's still lacking

903
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
yeah

904
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,680
and this is another slide from my

905
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,480
presentation in

906
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,119
2012 in a workshop after agercrypt

907
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,480
and uh the subtitle of my talk was how

908
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,320
to become a good cook

909
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,359
because i think designing cryptosystem

910
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,480
is like

911
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,440
becoming the good cook you pick the best

912
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,680
in in greek ingredients and you have a

913
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,040
recipe and then you have the the goal is

914
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,880
to have a very harmonized nice dish

915
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
and then i thought this how to write

916
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,079
this kind of recipe is an example of

917
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,839
sharing the experi

918
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,880
experiences and good practices so that

919
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,079
someone who came in later can read the

920
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,400
recipe and

921
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
revise the same

922
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,960
nice dish

923
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,079
so uh as i said uh

924
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,359
the best practices to write good recipe

925
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,920
it's it's still in need

926
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,240
and also uh i think this is still true

927
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,280
uh we need permission from our customers

928
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,800
to write a recipe about the real life

929
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,760
systems and uh many of the customers

930
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,240
hesitate to publish this kind of recipe

931
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
because if they disclose it uh there

932
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,200
might be some a security risk

933
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,160
for

934
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
disclosing it

935
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,359
actually i i wanted to talk about uh

936
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,839
another of my success story which i

937
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,880
really

938
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,599
loved it because everybody enjoyed uh

939
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,079
the product that i built

940
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,400
but the customer says oh please don't

941
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,960
talk about us so i i it's unfortunate i

942
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,040
won't be able to tell here

943
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,240
but

944
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,160
uh but the story is i i really have an

945
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
experience that

946
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,920
the people that there's a system that

947
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,720
uses public key cryptosystem uh that

948
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,760
everybody is benefiting from that

949
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
function

950
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,160
uh and i just wanted to share uh

951
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,480
that i really loved and reading this

952
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,240
book by uh ross anderson titled security

953
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,440
engineering

954
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,079
it's it's a very thick book it's over a

955
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,319
thousand pages and this has been

956
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,760
published last year but i thought this

957
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
is a very good way of sharing experience

958
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,960
and he writes a lot about what kind of

959
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,000
things

960
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,160
he designed or what kind of things that

961
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
didn't go right and it's about security

962
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
engineering so uh

963
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,920
i i i'm looking forward to find a place

964
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
where we can talk things like this and

965
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,359
share

966
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,680
uh it's it this book is only about

967
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
ross's

968
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,040
experience but

969
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,319
many exp many researchers or many

970
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,560
engineers share the experience on

971
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
cryptographic protocols is what i'm

972
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,119
looking forward to

973
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,480
and

974
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,839
after the the conference the workshop of

975
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,839
real life cryptographic protocols and

976
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,560
standardization yes we have real world

977
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,480
cryptosystem that collects many

978
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,960
attendees and also i really like this

979
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,240
conference ssr security standardization

980
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,160
research where they look

981
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,119
into

982
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,000
uh

983
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,079
the standardization

984
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,760
of the security technology so i i'm

985
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,079
really happy to see this community is

986
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,560
growing larger

987
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,960
and if you know of any communities that

988
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,839
i don't know i'll be very happy to learn

989
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,720
about those

990
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
and

991
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,319
until here

992
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,520
my journey was thinking bottom up that

993
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,599
is i started with cryptographic

994
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,400
protocols and i try

995
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,640
and design it to fit to the society

996
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,119
but i started to think

997
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,200
maybe it's i should be thinking top down

998
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,319
that is starting from society

999
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,800
and what can what kind of

1000
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,599
nice service or system we can have

1001
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,520
and to that what kind of cryptographic

1002
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
products protocols we can use

1003
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,280
this top-down approach

1004
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,640
was happening to me when our client came

1005
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,119
up to us and said i want to do this how

1006
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,359
can you do it and then i could design

1007
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,200
using uh

1008
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
i could find cryptographic protocols to

1009
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,119
meet that requirement

1010
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,560
but it's all the requirement from our

1011
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,359
client it's what they wanted to do so my

1012
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,800
question now is what do i want to do

1013
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,720
uh to

1014
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
to improve the society

1015
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
and one

1016
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,400
and then i i came up with one

1017
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
difficulty i had i was very angry at it

1018
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,680
that looking at the society why do we

1019
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,160
have to manage so many passwords for

1020
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,440
ourselves

1021
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,119
and i thought this was the

1022
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,400
infrastructure problem

1023
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,319
that the companies they just give us id

1024
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,480
and password and

1025
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,599
let us manage the password so they can

1026
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,839
be free of risk and if something bad

1027
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,079
happens they can blame us that you

1028
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,480
didn't manage your password correctly so

1029
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,359
i think this is the

1030
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,520
architecture problem

1031
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,319
so

1032
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,720
why can't

1033
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,640
why do we have to

1034
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,480
use given id and passwords for

1035
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,640
the different password for different

1036
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,920
services

1037
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,440
can we use

1038
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,720
just one or small number of public key

1039
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,079
that's common to all or many services

1040
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,560
just like my name i'm not changing my

1041
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,200
name for every services

1042
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,319
to me

1043
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,560
uh kazooie sako is the com is this

1044
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
consistent name for taking all the

1045
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
services

1046
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,200
and but also if i keep on saying the

1047
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,800
same uh identifier same name or the same

1048
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
public key then i can be traced so uh

1049
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,839
can we sometimes hide a public key but

1050
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,960
still prove that i have the right

1051
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,640
attribute to to receive the service

1052
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,760
and

1053
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,040
then i met this notion of self-sovereign

1054
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
identity

1055
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,319
so that identity it's sovereign i can

1056
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,319
choose my identity

1057
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,359
and then on top of it uh people add

1058
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,640
attributes to my identity so that i can

1059
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,160
use that to

1060
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,720
prove my uh care

1061
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,960
attribute

1062
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,480
so uh

1063
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,359
that

1064
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
is currently being standardized in a

1065
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,200
world wide web consortium sdid and vcs

1066
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,680
the id stands for decentralized

1067
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,280
identifiers and vc stands for verifiable

1068
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,640
credentials

1069
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,560
so there are

1070
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,599
many people working on to

1071
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,839
make this come true

1072
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,560
i do see some criticism against their

1073
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,119
approach but i think this is an

1074
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,160
important step to move the

1075
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,480
society forward

1076
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
and then the verifiable credential is a

1077
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,560
little bit a

1078
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,400
funny name because

1079
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
i always think the credentials should be

1080
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,520
verifiable but uh what they're trying to

1081
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,119
say is that

1082
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,480
the credential is something issued by

1083
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,720
a trusted authority

1084
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,440
but

1085
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,000
using anonymous authentication technique

1086
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,800
or the group signature technique you can

1087
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,920
hide

1088
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
some parts in the credentials and still

1089
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,440
you can verify the content of the

1090
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
credentials so i think that's where the

1091
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,319
name verifiable credential came from

1092
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,480
so uh

1093
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,760
so uh

1094
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,839
the

1095
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,839
what i wanted to say in this slide so

1096
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,319
there are many people trying to achieve

1097
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,319
this kind of a world

1098
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,640
and in it they are using a lot of crypto

1099
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
technology in it and trying to

1100
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,230
standardize it

1101
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,000
[Music]

1102
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,760
okay so now comes into twenties

1103
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,800
uh

1104
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,079
i now

1105
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,960
that was all my work with nec

1106
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,160
but i

1107
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,359
i moved to uh academics in

1108
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,559
last year because i thought

1109
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,839
i should now share my experience with

1110
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:56,960
students

1111
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,000
hoping

1112
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,319
that when they are going to start their

1113
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,000
business in future

1114
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,680
they can use cryptography freely they

1115
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,680
can base uh

1116
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,920
new systems on cryptography

1117
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,599
and when i

1118
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,760
left this private company i was

1119
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,920
very lucky that

1120
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,160
many japanese government offered me a

1121
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,960
position or position or being a member

1122
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,079
of the government a committee

1123
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,599
so i i work

1124
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
in many i work with japanese government

1125
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,160
uh for

1126
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,000
um

1127
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,680
and i was going to say um

1128
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,280
what i learned

1129
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,240
working with a cabinet secretariat or

1130
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,359
the financial service agency and even

1131
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,520
supreme court

1132
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,119
they are

1133
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,520
they have high expectations on

1134
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,400
cryptography

1135
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,599
one

1136
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,800
because uh they also want to make their

1137
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
system secure

1138
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,480
and two

1139
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,920
they

1140
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,040
they

1141
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,000
need to know the technology in order to

1142
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,079
regulate it

1143
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,359
and they want to regulate correctly

1144
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,000
and then the current law we have in

1145
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,800
japan and probably in other parts of the

1146
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,559
world it's so outdated that because all

1147
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,119
these regulations are based on physical

1148
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,240
objects like papers and ink so they want

1149
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,760
to update

1150
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,480
their regulations and their laws

1151
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,599
so

1152
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,079
we can handle these things going on

1153
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,400
digital

1154
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
so i i am i am very happy to take part

1155
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,160
in it and from their

1156
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,000
conversation with

1157
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,599
them

1158
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,720
i i strongly believe that cryptography

1159
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,520
and cryptographic protocols play a big

1160
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,400
role

1161
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,960
in designing our society

1162
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,359
and enforcing rules in a transparent way

1163
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,280
and

1164
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,520
now our challenges

1165
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,880
is what kind of design

1166
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,559
should we adopting

1167
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,440
and what kind of laws to support this

1168
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,160
design need to be fixed that's our

1169
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,319
challenge to consider

1170
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,400
and we should all be in the conversation

1171
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,040
to decide about the design for the

1172
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,640
society

1173
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,680
and therefore i strongly believe sharing

1174
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,240
our experiences is very crucial

1175
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,079
okay so with five minutes last left i

1176
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,800
the i will quickly run through the

1177
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,680
concluding remarks again uh this talk

1178
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,640
was intended to student i hope i can

1179
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,599
uh perceive you that your talent is

1180
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,960
really wanted in society for for for

1181
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,800
designing the society

1182
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,640
so for future steps

1183
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,839
five simple things uh

1184
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,880
discuss with people in other disciplines

1185
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,720
promote good and useful standardization

1186
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,079
and develop how to share experiences and

1187
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,640
collect good practices

1188
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,079
design society using cryptography

1189
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,280
and one thing i didn't touch uh

1190
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,359
mentioned very much but

1191
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,880
yes uh global

1192
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,640
interoperability is very important and

1193
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,319
we have to think what's going on

1194
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,599
globally

1195
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,480
but i think uh we all should also

1196
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,599
respect our local culture this is asia

1197
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,280
crypt there are many countries with

1198
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
different culture in asia

1199
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,119
and it's the people with the culture who

1200
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,760
is going to use the system so even

1201
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,400
though

1202
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,119
the technology may be

1203
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,960
inter operable interoperable worldwide

1204
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,000
but these interfaces with the humans we

1205
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,240
really have to think about the culture

1206
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,000
about the people who is using the system

1207
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,880
and

1208
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,079
their perception is really important to

1209
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,720
have a successful society

1210
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,839
so my last word let's collaborate

1211
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,480
thank you for your attention

1212
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,240
thank you very much uh

1213
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,079
professor sacco

1214
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,200
um

1215
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,520
so for the great talk

1216
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,920
um i'm sure there are probably many

1217
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,599
questions um

1218
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:36,640
even though

1219
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,079
i

1220
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,119
don't think

1221
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,040
oh um

1222
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,839
kevin has a comment already so i'm sure

1223
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,880
he can uh

1224
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,800
mute

1225
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,520
yes i'd be happy to ask it orally i i

1226
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,640
think i was shocked in your talk by one

1227
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,119
thing you said which was that

1228
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,200
people didn't seem to care that much

1229
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,480
about

1230
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
the trustworthiness of the outcome of an

1231
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,160
election

1232
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,240
because this is a huge issue in the

1233
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,079
united states in the last

1234
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,079
presidential election

1235
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,640
and there's uh there's been a lot of

1236
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,720
doubt cast on the process of voting now

1237
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,319
so i wonder if you

1238
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,200
think that maybe people just didn't

1239
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
see the problem coming

1240
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,319
or have you changed your mind about that

1241
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,440
well thank you kevin for the great uh

1242
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,119
question and

1243
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,640
i i said uh culture is really different

1244
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,880
according to the region

1245
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,920
and

1246
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,520
uh this is my interesting perception

1247
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,440
that when i talk when i give talk about

1248
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,160
electronic voting in the u.s just as you

1249
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,760
said the correctness of tally is very

1250
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,800
cons is concerning in people in the u.s

1251
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,559
or in uh in american continent when i

1252
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,280
talk to people in europe

1253
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
they are interested in the privacy you

1254
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
vote

1255
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,920
and

1256
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,520
they care much

1257
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,720
about the

1258
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,359
how the privacy is protected in

1259
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,440
voting systems

1260
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
and when i talked to people in asia

1261
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,200
they did not care much about the

1262
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,440
the correctness of the tally or the

1263
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,240
privacy of the vote

1264
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,720
i think they took for granted or they

1265
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,480
very trust

1266
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,880
uh on the servers that they will do it

1267
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,839
good

1268
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,599
and what they

1269
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,119
their concern

1270
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,640
is

1271
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,359
how much efficient are the system is

1272
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,280
going to make us how

1273
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,160
how many money can we save from

1274
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,799
uh using your system that

1275
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,200
yes i think so that's the difference in

1276
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,680
culture and

1277
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,680
hope that answers your question

1278
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
yeah i think your your talk was very

1279
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,760
interesting and reflected a lot of my

1280
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,119
own thoughts about the difference

1281
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,040
between working in industry versus

1282
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,680
working in academia you've recently

1283
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
switched to go back to academia and i

1284
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,200
actually started in academia that went

1285
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,040
to industry to finish my career and

1286
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,680
i guess

1287
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,280
some students will have questions about

1288
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,760
which is better to pursue

1289
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,079
and do you have any advice on which do

1290
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,280
you think has

1291
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,119
what the advantages and disadvantages of

1292
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,599
the different

1293
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,799
employment modes are

1294
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,400
well i i only

1295
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,319
lived as i did so i really can't compare

1296
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,040
but i really enjoy working for a company

1297
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,920
because i had this experience of having

1298
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,119
my technology being used in society

1299
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,000
and

1300
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,359
that was really important for me to

1301
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,599
continue this career

1302
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,839
but at a certain time

1303
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,839
uh making some product into society

1304
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,160
there is that must come under the

1305
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,200
umbrella of a certain company so that

1306
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,000
must be profitable for that company so

1307
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,400
that was the time when i thought

1308
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,640
i want to do what i want to do so that's

1309
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,920
when i moved to academia and now i can

1310
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,280
use any umbrella of the other company so

1311
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,400
what i'm doing now is i can talk to any

1312
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,599
company

1313
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,200
to implement uh the new technology

1314
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,599
hoping that would benefit

1315
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,559
them so i can change the company now

1316
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,480
because i'm in academia i'm free to

1317
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,079
choose who to collaborate with

1318
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,119
so like if you go to a company that's

1319
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,440
tied to one company but if you're in

1320
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,599
academia you have more

1321
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,240
selections

1322
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,440
yeah i once uh worked for ibm and i want

1323
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,079
to do a project involving email and i

1324
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,319
was told to go talk to lotus about

1325
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,880
putting it into lotus notes

1326
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,720
and i didn't have any freedom to choose

1327
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
who to work with at that time so i

1328
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,759
dropped the whole project

1329
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,200
so

1330
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,079
calzo i got a question um so a lot of

1331
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,599
your talk was about

1332
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,640
you know

1333
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
you you very clearly said this is advice

1334
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,200
for youngsters and that was really cool

1335
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,880
um but

1336
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,040
in some sense the incentives

1337
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,040
the phd students and the postdocs in our

1338
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
community are kind of

1339
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,520
aligned against

1340
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,200
doing stuff like you said you're doing

1341
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,040
the simple stuff which will solve a real

1342
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,920
problem that is they're more it's more

1343
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,160
the incentives to more towards do

1344
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,760
something deep and complicated that no

1345
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,880
one's ever going to use because you're

1346
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,559
going to get your phd that way or you're

1347
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:41,920
going to get tenure that way or you're

1348
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,280
going to get your post up that way or

1349
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,160
whatever

1350
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,359
um so how do you think as icr

1351
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,640
can

1352
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,319
change the culture and change the

1353
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,799
incentives for youngsters to actually

1354
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,480
you know really engage with society

1355
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,079
engage with companies engage with real

1356
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,400
world problems and maybe even just

1357
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
deploy a simple you know come up with a

1358
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,839
simple solution to a complex problem

1359
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,280
rather than a complex one that will get

1360
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,240
a paper at crypto

1361
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,440
right i think i i i'm facing that

1362
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,319
problem as i said the only the output

1363
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,640
that falls in either

1364
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,960
this pink and blue are accepted at the

1365
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,079
papers

1366
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,079
so um

1367
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,599
because it's

1368
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,400
i.t technology we shouldn't be sticking

1369
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,400
to this old

1370
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,200
paper-based evaluation so i think the

1371
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,440
university must change

1372
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,200
and

1373
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,880
ray we should be setting up some

1374
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,440
criteria we should be serving for the

1375
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,799
society which

1376
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,400
that's

1377
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,559
i'm not sure if i

1378
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,920
won't offend someone else but i think we

1379
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
have to change the criteria of

1380
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,880
evaluation and what

1381
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,040
how contribution we are doing to the

1382
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,400
society matters more than having more

1383
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,040
academic output

1384
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,880
do you think that's something icr should

1385
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,040
kind of like push to try and

1386
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,920
change the reviewing culture to make

1387
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,599
potential societal impact a greater

1388
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,050
component of reviewing papers

1389
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,559
[Music]

1390
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,240
i would be happy if some part of iaco

1391
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,960
would support this idea

1392
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,680
but i i still understand some people

1393
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,760
would want to keep more rigorous

1394
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,200
mathematical

1395
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,079
more

1396
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,359
theoretical

1397
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,520
uh culture

1398
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,400
i think i think

1399
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,160
all cultures yeah like you said at the

1400
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,119
end it's not just cultures between

1401
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,160
apac

1402
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,720
emea and north america it's also

1403
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,319
cultures within the community as well

1404
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,440
there's lots of different cultures we

1405
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,960
need to respect so

1406
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,160
but there should be room for everything

1407
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,599
yeah thanks that's a really really cool

1408
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,520
tool thank you very much thank you very

1409
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,200
much

1410
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,480
um

1411
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,400
thank you nigel um

1412
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,559
i so i guess so um a time question is

1413
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,119
obviously to what extent did

1414
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,359
do you see rwc as a success

1415
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,760
so yes i do think rwc is a great success

1416
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,960
but

1417
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,400
still the presentation slot is limited

1418
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,520
and what we see there is the best

1419
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,280
of the experience so

1420
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,400
uh

1421
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,359
i think i when i was writing these

1422
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,079
slides i thought maybe sharing these

1423
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,599
experiences

1424
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,720
uh could be more local

1425
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,040
uh by region to reason by culture to

1426
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,000
culture

1427
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,559
and then like rwc is going to be a big

1428
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,640
umbrella that it's sort of fostering

1429
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,078
that kind of a community

1430
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,640
okay thank you um i see uh muhammad

1431
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,599
has has a couple of questions as well

1432
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,799
maybe you can unmute and ask

1433
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,270
[Music]

1434
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,040
oh

1435
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,000
well that's not working perhaps it's

1436
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,880
best to read his questions okay so his

1437
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,119
first question was regarding group

1438
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,839
signatures

1439
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:39,760
um sorry regarding group signatures do

1440
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,280
you have any experience or thoughts

1441
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,240
about intel's offering named enhanced

1442
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,440
privacy identification ipad so i'm not

1443
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,960
familiar with this

1444
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,760
uh

1445
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,799
i i don't think so i i know they were

1446
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,880
working on tpm

1447
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,400
and uh remote attestation uh

1448
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,119
protocol using advanced

1449
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,760
or the modification of group signatures

1450
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,400
uh but i i don't think i have enough

1451
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,280
information about epid

1452
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,400
all right

1453
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,160
and and the second question is can you

1454
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,839
elaborate on the point that you

1455
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,839
mentioned in the beginning that this you

1456
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:16,640
said

1457
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,880
so they said your approach was too

1458
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,440
complex and they decided to go for a

1459
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,680
cloud system and in their approach based

1460
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,039
on the cloud

1461
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,920
how did they ensure security or privacy

1462
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,200
and uh

1463
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,319
and so maybe have some links to share

1464
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,400
i'm not sure to what but okay so that's

1465
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,920
the question

1466
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,640
okay so uh thank you for your question

1467
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,799
so

1468
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,200
okay so

1469
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,079
you have to think that this is 15 years

1470
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,240
ago right at that time

1471
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,760
uh there weren't

1472
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,520
any well

1473
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,799
the cloud system wasn't so common

1474
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,400
and what we did here in actual

1475
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,440
system

1476
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,319
is that you see these mixers here

1477
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,839
so it's it's the professors who is doing

1478
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,640
running the system on their computer

1479
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,799
and then what they what we did was there

1480
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,520
was an email from this professor to the

1481
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,640
next professor saying this is the result

1482
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,599
of the mixed ballot and now this the

1483
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,559
second

1484
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,799
yellow mixer is going to shuffle and

1485
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,280
then pass it on to the next professor

1486
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,039
and then they finally get the answer so

1487
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,039
it included many um manual operations so

1488
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,640
that's why it was more complex but we

1489
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,119
wanted to be rigorous and we didn't want

1490
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,280
to use the cloud because

1491
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,599
we as uh

1492
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,240
as the organized well as the planner

1493
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,039
designer did not trust the cloud

1494
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,240
services

1495
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,079
but the people

1496
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,799
uh said to me oh it's just use the cloud

1497
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,839
server that's more easier and that's the

1498
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:00,720
more

1499
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,920
uh

1500
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,559
fashionable way to do it

1501
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,079
so

1502
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,839
so i think that was the difference in

1503
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:08,880
views

1504
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,960
we wanted uh

1505
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,200
we wanted more security and privacy but

1506
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,599
the others wanted more ease-of-useness

1507
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,440
over security and privacy

1508
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,440
hope that answers your question

1509
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,039
thanks i i guess that's uh

1510
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,400
um that's still an issue in many uh

1511
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,680
cases

1512
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,799
um

1513
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,839
okay so i i think uh these are these

1514
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,640
were all the questions um again uh we

1515
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,839
were very honored to have you

1516
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,559
giving an invited talk and

1517
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,640
hopefully if there are more questions

1518
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,119
we can take them offline in zulip or

1519
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,240
otherwise

1520
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,520
and so we will reconvene in about 20

1521
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,640
minutes

1522
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,279
for
