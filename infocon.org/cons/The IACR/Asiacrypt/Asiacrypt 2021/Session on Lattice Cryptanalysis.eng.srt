1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,160
go ahead have a good session

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,200
thanks

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,279
so welcome everyone for this last

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,000
session of asiacrypt2021

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,559
uh so this is a session on uh let's

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,160
descript analysis if you're looking for

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,480
a real one

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
oh alice your sound dropped out at least

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
for me anybody else

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
yes three for some reason yeah

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,719
i don't know

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,600
okay

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
let me

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,360
let me keep an eye on it

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,239
okay

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,718
so um

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
okay uh sorry back questions if you have

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
any questions uh feel free to ask them

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
uh

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
either on the chat

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
here

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
or just unmute yourself to a square

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,640
and

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
oh sorry

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
it's the song going like this

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,360
uh yeah it's sort of

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
sort of surging in and out of existence

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,520
okay

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
okay

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,960
yeah

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
sometimes you can fix it by

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
selecting audio settings

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
and then disabling things like

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
automatically adjust micro microphone

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
volume or things like that okay we'll

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,720
try this while this is picking so for

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
the moment i'm just keep clicking on it

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,960
and

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,520
so i hope it works so our first girl is

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,560
going to be vessel

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
he's going to tell us about a joint work

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
with leo duca

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
on um

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
on and through the stretch regime of

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
andrew and when does the

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
overstretch starts

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
so vessel the floor is yours

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
yeah thank you for the introduction

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
alice

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
um

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
so andrew is a lattice-based public key

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
cryptosystem

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
of which many variants exist one of

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
which simply known as andrew which is a

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,319
nist postcon crypto finalist

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
and until recently that's reduction

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
attacks were thought to behave similar

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
on these android instances as on the

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,760
ring

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
or just lwe

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
however

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,080
it was shown by kirchner fuch that

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
in the in the regime for large small ioq

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
that's reduction behaves better than

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
than you would expect

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,440
and we call this the overstretch regime

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
and the main question of our work is

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
when do we go from the splendor

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
stretched to the normal regime to this

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
overstretch machine

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
so our main contribution is that we

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
explain precisely how bkz breaks

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
overstress and through

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
and we predict precisely when bkc breaks

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,160
over stretch center

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,239
so what's the end through problem well

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
first we have a secret key that consists

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
of small elements f and g and some ring

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
are

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
and we have a public key h that's given

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,239
by g times f inverse molar q for some

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
modulus q

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
and throughout this presentation you can

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,400
think of the ring r as z x over x to the

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
n minus one and these elements f and g

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,959
are small in the sense that their

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
coefficients

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
are uniform over minus one zero and one

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
so then the the answer problem asked to

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
given this public key h to recover

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
the secret key f.g or just any what we

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
call rotation of it

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
so it's kind of equivalent

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
um

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
so to solve this problem using let's

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
reduction we first need to define a

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
letters

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
and and through letters is just given by

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
all pairs a dot b

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,760
so that h times a equals b mod q and

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
note that the the secret key the f f g

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
also satisfies this

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
and this lets us two very important

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
properties namely the first one is that

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
it contains these rotations of the

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
secret key and for most parameters these

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
are unusually short vectors in this

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
lattice

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
and secondly these rotations also

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,760
generate an unusually dense subletters

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
of high rank in this letters

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,320
and

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
just recovering this dense sublet is is

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,639
already enough most of the time to

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
actually break the cryptosystem

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
and after that it's very much easier to

117
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
recover these uh

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
uh these short fact like the shikit key

119
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
okay so our question is how does bkc uh

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
recover these uh

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
rotations of the secret key or or then

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
sublets factors

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
well we see that for in in the under

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,680
stretch regime for small values of q

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
bkc first finds immediately the the

126
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,720
rotation of the secret key

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
and this is similar to how you would uh

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
like it behave similar as unique sap for

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
which we have very concrete predictions

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,759
and indeed we can see that the estimate

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,920
given by these unique sap

132
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,199
[Music]

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,400
methods

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
closely follow the experiments

135
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
however at some point when we increased

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,199
the model's q

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,800
we don't

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
first find these secret keys but we find

139
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,080
then sublets vectors

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
and we do find these at much lower block

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
sizes so much earlier

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,039
than

143
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,600
expected or predicted by these

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
these unique sp estimates

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
and this crossover point is what we call

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
the fatigue point and note that in this

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
instance for like n equal to 127 it

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
already lies quite low at around 700.

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
and given that the nist parameters

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,520
are about linear in n so q is about uh

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
four times n or five times n

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,400
uh this is alright it's already quite uh

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
close to that so

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
um it's not really clear where these

155
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
parameters lie if they lie in the in the

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,000
stress or the overstretch machine

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
so what do we know from this

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,199
overstretched regime but we know that at

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
least when q is at least

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
n to the power 2.783

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,039
um

162
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,720
then we are in this regime and this was

163
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,680
shown by fusion

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
however what they only show is a kind of

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
a distinguisher so they

166
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
allow you to detect if this latch

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
contains a dense sublets or not

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,479
but they don't really explain it doesn't

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,560
really explain how this dense sublex is

170
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
then recovered

171
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
and secondly it's it's not concrete you

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
could make it concrete but then still

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,039
it's very far from uh practical

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,520
observations

175
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
so we want to kneel down this fatigue

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
point

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
so our main result is that bkc finds a

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
dense sublets vector at position n minus

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
beta over 2 so that's kind of the middle

180
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
block when beta is at least this

181
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
quantity

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
and this is uh the same as for the

183
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
kitchen of however if you look at the

184
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
closer at the constants then we do

185
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
improve on their result

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
and this means that the fatigue point

187
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
lies at

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
totally at n to the power 2.484

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,039
but more importantly because we now

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
understand what happens

191
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
we can also do an efforts case analysis

192
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
and give concrete predictions that

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,680
closely

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
match the experiments

195
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
and because we now understand both

196
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
regimes we can also give a concrete

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
estimate for the fatigue point

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
and we nail it down to about 0.004 times

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
n to the power 2.484

200
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
and this also explains why this fatigue

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
point in our experiments was so low

202
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,400
because of this low constant but because

203
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,120
the

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
of this high exponent then this

205
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,879
parameters are still lying in the

206
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,440
spindle stretched regime

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,199
so the key takeaways we now have

208
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
concrete predictions uh for all values

209
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
of the modulus queue

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
and the fatigue point lies much lower

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,520
than expected but still well above these

212
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
nist parameters

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,960
the code is available is added for the

214
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,520
experiments and the predictor and the

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
full paper is available in print so

216
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
thank you for listening

217
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
thank you

218
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,199
vessel um

219
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
do we have any questions from the

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
audience

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
so you can unmute yourself you can write

222
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
in the chat you can write on your lip

223
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
everything you like

224
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,039
i can maybe start with a short question

225
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
why people

226
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
write or think of that question

227
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
and

228
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,279
yeah so i had a question you say

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,640
kirchner it gives a new

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
distinguishing attack

231
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
in your case you say you can recover

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,839
a short vector in the dance so i guess

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,320
from this you can also recover the short

234
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
the dense sublettis

235
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,519
and in the rec

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
recorded talk you should say that

237
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,040
usually you can also recover a short

238
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
vector not just the dense abilities can

239
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
you say more on this

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
um yeah so first you recover this this

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
dead supplex factor

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,399
but what we see is that after this

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
so if you have one denser that's vector

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
you can also recover the fill

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
then subletters by just looking at the

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,680
rotations and

247
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
intersecting this with your letters

248
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
um and then what you essentially get is

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,959
a

250
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,120
just a much lower dimensional problem so

251
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
you just have a rank n

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,160
letters

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,519
and inside of this lattice you still

254
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,920
have a quite unusually short vector so

255
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,279
it again becomes a unique sap but a much

256
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
easier one

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
so what you most see in practice is that

258
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
bkz makes sure that

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
as a result of bkz the first n vectors

260
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
in your bases just become this this then

261
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
sub lattice and it almost immediately

262
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
recovers the secret key

263
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
so

264
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
after just a few more rounds of after

265
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
finding this dance of lattice

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
factory you also recover the philistine

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
okay

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,480
thanks

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
there's a question from needy

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
yeah so i was wondering if you had uh

271
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
an estimator for the the cost of this

272
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
attack in some sense

273
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
and uh

274
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
like similarly so you say that the

275
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
the

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
the cost of the attack is um

277
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,440
is much so you you're you're still uh

278
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
far uh

279
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,399
so the the

280
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
nest parameters are still far far below

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
your fatigue point but so if if i

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
um if i'm not mistaken like for

283
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
in in dimension 512 for example the

284
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
fatigue point is like something like 20

285
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,959
000

286
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
whereas the or maybe 40 000 whereas the

287
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,600
the proposed parameters like 12 000 so

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
the

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,640
the gap is really is isn't is not that

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
large and so

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
like many many people have suggested

292
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
taking like form for

293
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
not for cams but for signatures to take

294
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
q to be 2 to the 20 for example

295
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
and so this would be

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
way into your range of parameters so i

297
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
was wondering if you can estimate the

298
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
cost of the of the resulting attack for

299
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
such parameters

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
uh yeah so we get we have like an

301
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,079
estimator that's given the the the

302
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
parameters you can get a very precise uh

303
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
block size that's needed

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,560
and then you can use the the standard uh

305
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,279
well

306
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,240
estimates for how how costly pkg is to

307
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,959
run with this block size

308
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,359
thank you

309
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
i think there is one question on zulip

310
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
maybe we have time for this last

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
question before moving on

312
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
um

313
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
so let me read it

314
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,360
do tower field structures affect the

315
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
cross point of the best attack or lead

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
to better attacks

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
um so i think this was uh discussed in

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
the kitchen fruit paper so you so before

319
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
that paper you had like this these

320
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
subfield attacks and and

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
um

322
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
and and basically the kitchen food paper

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
showed that okay we don't actually need

324
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
those uh just because he itself already

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
acts better

326
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
and i think they also say that this

327
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
the trade-off you get from these towers

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,079
is worse than what you just get from the

329
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
big ic attack but

330
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
i'm not an expert on those

331
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,560
kind of attacks

332
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,720
thanks

333
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
okay

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
thanks a lot so

335
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,360
let's move on to uh the next paper

336
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
so let's see if you could stop streams

337
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
here great thing

338
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,560
you're up

339
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
so the next the next paper is on faster

340
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
dual lattice attacks for solving elder

341
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
be with applications so crystals and

342
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,480
jiangul we give the talk and this is

343
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
joint work with thomas johansson you

344
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,880
have the floor

345
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,760
i can't hear you

346
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,560
well

347
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
thanks for

348
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
the introduction and thank you for

349
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
coming to my talk

350
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
so

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
uh so i will start with this nist pqc

352
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
project and now we know that we are in

353
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
the third round we have seven finalists

354
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
selected and the majority are lattice

355
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,839
based

356
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,040
so

357
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
we know that for this lattice for these

358
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,320
lattice-based schemes the concrete

359
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
security can be related to solving an lw

360
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
instance the main most relevant attacks

361
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
are that is based on lattice reduction

362
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,839
attacks

363
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,680
including primal and dual attacks so

364
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,079
um when we select secure parameters

365
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,519
usually we use

366
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,639
bkc

367
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
that iterative calling svp oracle with a

368
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
smaller size so

369
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
asymptotically the best svp oracle are

370
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
implemented by sieving and we use this

371
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
notation so beta is svp dimension and d

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,920
is the lattice dimension

373
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,639
so

374
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,040
to estimate the cost for bkc we have

375
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
this famous core svp model the main idea

376
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,079
is to keeping the main complex term and

377
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
just discard the sub-exponential term so

378
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
this model is very good but still this

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,480
is an approximation because discarded

380
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
sub-export that mentioned term can be

381
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,720
big

382
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
you can also show the significant code

383
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
dimension for free means that svp in

384
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
dimension beta can be solved using a

385
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
sieve in a smaller dimension

386
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,440
and the last issue could albert at all

387
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
first started the classic and the

388
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
quantum competitive sieving in the ram

389
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
model

390
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
ram means random access machine so based

391
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,720
on this research also with progressive

392
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
sieving the designers started this uh

393
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
beyond core svp harness means classical

394
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,240
gate complexion metric in the ram model

395
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
so they only study primal lattice

396
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
attacks

397
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
so the designers dismissed they do

398
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,600
attack because they think that first

399
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,079
most of these vectors uh get from

400
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
receiving larger by

401
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
a factor secondly the trick of

402
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,160
exploiting all the vectors is not

403
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,000
compatible with the dimension for free

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,839
trick

405
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,920
so the research question here is should

406
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
we dismiss do lattice attack one way

407
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
selecting parameters the answer is no

408
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
actually we can exploit both games here

409
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
both games means this

410
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
default game and also once they produce

411
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
many short vectors and also we can still

412
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
output on prime attacks whereas the

413
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,240
short vectors are larger and larger

414
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,279
so

415
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,560
what we do is we propose a fast duality

416
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
attack with two main contributions one

417
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
is the new ablation by a style fft

418
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
distinguished with fft

419
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
alphabetic size reduced from q to gamma

420
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
because gamma is much smaller than q so

421
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,480
we can have a larger ffd dimension

422
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
secondly we propose a new two-step

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
lattice reduction strategy that can

424
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
exploit both skins

425
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
these are two models for this d4f gain

426
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
we have this asymptotic model based on

427
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
this asymptotic analysis and we also

428
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,079
have this extrapolation model first

429
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,320
appeared in this jessica paper this is

430
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,839
extrapolated from

431
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,639
experimental data but this is a lot com

432
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
model and

433
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,839
theodook has suggested not to use this

434
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,040
model

435
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,839
so

436
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
for

437
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
we apply our

438
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
algorithm to crystals and also certain

439
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
fhe parameters and improve the state of

440
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
the art and

441
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,320
actually this dual attack has very wide

442
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
applications in lattice-based crypto the

443
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,800
take-home messages do not dismiss do

444
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
lattice attacks

445
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
here we show some complex numbers so

446
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,639
this is complex numbers for kyber

447
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,439
768 this is aim for this three so the

448
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,039
claimed prime

449
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,959
complexity for primal attacks is 250. so

450
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,559
use this extrapolation model we get 205

451
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,079
but as

452
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,720
discussed before we will not claim that

453
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,679
we use this model to break uh

454
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,520
cut this kyber 768.

455
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,360
now we focus on this asymptotic d5 model

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
uh with this progressive bkc with 1 2

457
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,960
and this gsa to estimate the quality of

458
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
outputs the shortest vectors we get a

459
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
complexity of two of seven

460
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,640
this is

461
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,440
so

462
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,280
ducas also said that

463
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,480
this gsa model could be too optimistic

464
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
and actually according to a simulator he

465
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
sent us we need larger

466
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
beta to achieve this quality so the

467
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
complexity is to

468
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
one

469
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
we are still starting this uh simulator

470
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,160
so this is this number is just for your

471
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,360
information

472
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
we also use a forklord model like we use

473
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
eight bkz tools so we need 80 times hd

474
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
svp course

475
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
to achieve this gsa quality and the

476
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,000
complexity is 208

477
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,919
so this is for kyber

478
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,000
actually we get software results for

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
this entry parameter because they only

480
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
claim the

481
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
they claimed the 209 bits of security so

482
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
the security margin is only two bits so

483
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
uh for the uh all the models discussed

484
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,360
above as we can

485
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,320
do below the

486
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
secure level like

487
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,720
two or seven bits

488
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
so

489
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
thank you very much for your attentions

490
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
and also we would like to thank dukas

491
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
for his helpful comments and uh helpful

492
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,799
discussions

493
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,440
thank you

494
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,320
right

495
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
thanks a lot so uh please um all know

496
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
kind of you know you know how it goes uh

497
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,000
ask away um

498
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,880
can i can i kick off questions with um a

499
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
question

500
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,039
so

501
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
you have you combined several techniques

502
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,559
here in order to improve the performance

503
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,640
of the dual attack uh can you give us a

504
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,880
sense of like how much each of those

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
building blocks contributes like one of

506
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
the tricks is to kind of uh you know get

507
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
many samples out of sieving and then the

508
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,720
fft and then so what is the the major

509
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
contribution to improving the

510
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,360
performance of the attack

511
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,080
uh i think definitely this uh

512
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,720
this uh one seaweed produce many

513
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
many short vectors is a dominant part if

514
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,679
without that then

515
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
we will had extremely large complexity

516
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
compared with uh

517
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,360
with primal attacks

518
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,720
uh and also another is like this uh

519
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,600
gassing also also guessing i mean for

520
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
this very sparse secret guessing is very

521
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,840
helpful and also ffts can reduce also

522
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,959
can reduce several bits

523
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
cool a question in the

524
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
zulub libchat is your full paper

525
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
available

526
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
uh

527
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
i think it goes it it addresses that

528
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
it's not on eprint

529
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
um so

530
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
i guess that's the question but you'll

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
see feel free to

532
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
clarify

533
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,480
the

534
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
the current version the conference

535
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
version is published and uh

536
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,320
yeah we are still

537
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
working on some extensions so

538
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
we are still working but i think it will

539
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
appear soon

540
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,760
uh

541
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
thomas in the chat is there a reason why

542
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
it doesn't impact other nest lattice

543
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,039
finalists is there something specific

544
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,679
about crystals here

545
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
uh

546
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
this also applies to to anchor it's just

547
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
the crystal uh

548
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,120
has uh has relatively low secure margin

549
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,600
um not like that but

550
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
but it's uh

551
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
i mean compiled to others it's uh

552
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
i mean some schemes have have even

553
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,520
larger security margins so

554
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
but but now it seems like like this

555
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
andrew h

556
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,360
hps that parameters uh offers the lowest

557
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,399
security margin so

558
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,400
okay great as far as i can tell this is

559
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
for now

560
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
oh there's another question could you

561
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
elaborate on the two-step process you

562
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
mentioned uh is this in the conference

563
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
version of the paper asked you'll see

564
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,559
uh yes

565
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,559
so the first step is just that this

566
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,919
this pkc is and you can produce a good

567
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
basis and also use this default game and

568
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
the second step is like this

569
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,679
[Music]

570
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,559
you we we have a sieving on

571
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
sub-lettuce and then this this ceiling

572
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
will produce many short factors and also

573
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,400
this ceiling uh

574
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
because in the first pkc we will cause

575
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
this beam for many times so in this

576
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
second step we can use a lot larger

577
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
sieving than the cv and then receive

578
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,960
used

579
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
in the first step so means that we can

580
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
have a few more dimensions in the second

581
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,840
c

582
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,600
that's that's a general framework

583
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,280
okay great so um thanks again uh for the

584
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,080
presentation and the paper um i think uh

585
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
we're now ready to move on to the next

586
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,799
one

587
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
okay sex

588
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
eh

589
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,919
i try to can you stop sharing and

590
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,480
and then joanna

591
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
yes

592
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,799
perfect

593
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,799
so we are ready to go for the third talk

594
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,919
of

595
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
this session

596
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,400
um so this talk is going to be given by

597
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
joanna

598
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
it's a joint work with andre you

599
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,559
on

600
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
latissiving with quantum random works

601
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,720
so johanna whenever you are ready

602
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
it's it's

603
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
hi so i'm going to talk about latest in

604
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,760
their confirmation work

605
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,640
um so a little bit of context before we

606
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,520
begin uh so with the emergence of anthem

607
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,679
converters that will soon be able to

608
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
factorize and serve as a discrete lab

609
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
we need new cryptosystems which are

610
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
quantum the resistance

611
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
on the

612
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,720
zunis launch few years ago international

613
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
contest no doubt was standard with them

614
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,120
among the final candidates several

615
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,360
criticisms are demonstrated from the

616
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
latest based problems and in this

617
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,799
presentation we'll focus on svp because

618
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,520
if we cancel svps then the reduction

619
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
makes that we can solve the other

620
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,320
program as efficiently

621
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
so in a nutshell tomorrow what cyber

622
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,640
security will certainly depend on their

623
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
hardness uh so easily

624
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
that's why it is important to know in

625
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,720
how much time on with which amount of

626
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
space resources the opponents can break

627
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,679
a cryptos them based on test parent

628
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,640
so the shortest vector problem is given

629
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,080
a basis for example here b1 and b2

630
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
we consider the set of all integral

631
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
linear combinations

632
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
which is called elitis on the

633
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,039
test program ask us to find the shortest

634
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
vector of the lady

635
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
so there are several methods to solve

636
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,720
ldp

637
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,919
all of them are running exponential tank

638
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,320
and the one of this measured is a bike

639
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
ceiling so we start with a list of

640
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
vectors of a certain number

641
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,559
and at the end of the 6th step we get a

642
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,760
list of shorter vectors

643
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
to do that we check the pairs of the

644
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,120
little list vectors under if they are

645
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
closed in angle as their difference has

646
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,320
a photon so we will repeat at this step

647
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
again and again until we are

648
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,919
um

649
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,480
so we we applied this steps uh to get

650
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,640
shorter and shorter vectors um after a

651
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,720
few steps so we can get a very short

652
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,520
vector uh which we hope it is the

653
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
shortest vector

654
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,440
we can improve this algorithm by using

655
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
locality sensitive altering so it is

656
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,919
allowed to

657
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,240
efficiently compute the nearest filters

658
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,640
around the vector using

659
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,679
a newer decoding code structure so we

660
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,080
can insert vectors in their nearest

661
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,799
filters and then check if the filters if

662
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
there is a closed vector instead of

663
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
checking the whole list which is a way

664
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,039
larger

665
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,320
our algorithm works in two steps first

666
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,400
we separate the sphere of vectors in

667
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,039
large areas using filters

668
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
and then

669
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
in each area

670
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
we run quantum random works to find all

671
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,720
the pairs of those vectors and the work

672
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,799
chooses the second layer of factoring to

673
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,080
reduce the time complex

674
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
so these are brazen runs

675
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
in exponential time like all

676
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,279
the other cells

677
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,000
here at the time of

678
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,640
the day in our country space exponents

679
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,039
we get from the trader

680
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,440
by choosing the parameters in our

681
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
algorithm we can recover the

682
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
complexities of the best classic

683
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,200
algorithm

684
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
um under the previous base confirm

685
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,320
algorithm

686
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
on the now we have better optimal time

687
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
complexity for the

688
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,559
for the silver to solve svp

689
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,120
so concretely that implies that a good

690
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,760
system based on svp which was claimed to

691
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,600
have 128 bits of the security and now it

692
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,799
has lost a problem

693
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
so thank you very much for having me

694
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,720
listing my talk and if you have

695
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,159
questions i will be happy to answer

696
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,240
thank you joanna

697
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
uh

698
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,279
so let me

699
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,919
ask the first question why people write

700
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,200
theirs

701
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,360
unless someone unmute themselves no

702
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,159
uh yeah so i have a knife questions from

703
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,520
non-quantum

704
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,960
expert so

705
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,799
you as i understand you improve the

706
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,120
algorithm by replacing grover by either

707
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,279
quantum random work

708
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,399
and

709
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,960
so grover i can understand that

710
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
it gains a lot of our classical if you

711
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
manage to have a big search like you

712
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
need to search in a big space

713
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
that's where you will gain the most and

714
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
in the case of the quantum random work

715
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,760
and you also have some nice criteria for

716
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
a classical algorithm that will be

717
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,200
improved a lot by the quantum random

718
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
work

719
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,399
um

720
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,200
so sorry can you repeat the last

721
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
part of your question yeah i was

722
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,480
wondering whether there is an easy way

723
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
to express like conditions on the

724
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,640
classical algorithm so that quantum

725
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
random work is going to

726
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
increase the runtime

727
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,559
a lot like for grover it's you need to

728
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,320
have as much search as possible kind of

729
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,559
that's what it's going to be accelerated

730
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,520
by quantum and maybe can we change a bid

731
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
algorithm to

732
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,240
have even

733
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
more speed up in the quantum

734
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,200
world maybe it's not an interesting

735
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
question

736
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,080
uh sorry i i don't understand

737
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,559
okay no problem

738
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
it's really naive question maybe no it's

739
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,080
my english level i'm sorry

740
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,960
you um

741
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
if i replace a us if

742
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
we can get

743
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,679
an improvement or using random works in

744
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,480
for classical reason um

745
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
yeah so would there be a nice way to

746
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
express the algorithm so that the

747
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,600
quantum random work really improves a

748
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,919
lot like could it be that maybe the

749
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,480
classical algorithm is not the good one

750
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
but maybe we change it a bit and then

751
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,120
the quantum speed up

752
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
um

753
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,640
in fact

754
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
the two steps of the algorithm

755
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
separating here and then doing the

756
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
quantum model works uh

757
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
for the

758
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,799
it is the first step that allows to get

759
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,679
a

760
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
very

761
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,480
lower time experience

762
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,559
yeah okay

763
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,600
do we have any other question

764
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,720
you can unmute yourself

765
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
so i see the question in the chat

766
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,390
[Music]

767
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
i have a naive question

768
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,600
how does it interact with these lower

769
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,010
bounds that

770
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,399
[Music]

771
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,399
tyson elena recently established

772
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,880
i didn't hear

773
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,840
can you

774
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,960
repeat oh there were there was some

775
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,240
recent lower bounds for saving a step

776
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
i was wondering if uh how your work

777
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,200
interacts uh with those lower bounds

778
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,200
if there is a lower burn or sitting yeah

779
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,679
um creates a in

780
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,480
a square root of four verse three for

781
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
our d with this dimension of the lattice

782
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,919
we can't

783
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,320
get lower so it is born in

784
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,799
okay thanks

785
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,279
thank you

786
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
any

787
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
other questions otherwise maybe we move

788
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
to the next dogs

789
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
no one

790
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,720
okay so let's go

791
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
chi ching are you here

792
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,640
uh yes

793
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,840
cool

794
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,519
then uh

795
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,640
let the screen sharing comments

796
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,679
okay i

797
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,039
i don't see you

798
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,120
uh so maybe there's something wrong with

799
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,518
my slice

800
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,159
if you can't share your screen maybe one

801
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
of your co-authors can't

802
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,679
uh sorry there's something wrong with my

803
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,880
computer i guess

804
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,960
ah sorry albrecht sorry martin sorry

805
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,200
uh

806
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,960
most

807
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
most

808
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,159
could you

809
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,840
email your slides

810
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,799
somewhere

811
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,519
say to me and then i share okay okay

812
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,760
okay okay okay

813
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,679
uh let me maybe there's something wrong

814
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,399
with my can you tell me your email

815
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,120
well just put it on the zulu chat

816
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,320
yeah yes yes but it's a long one

817
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,919
okay i just talk a result this night

818
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,600
as you wish whatever you prefer

819
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,399
uh

820
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,120
maybe i can send it to you

821
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,918
um sure

822
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
you tell me your

823
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,040
i will type it in the chat here

824
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,560
yeah did you receive there it's nice

825
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,799
not yet

826
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,960
okay i think i've got them

827
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,079
you send me attack file

828
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,320
oh sorry

829
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,119
so

830
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
can you see it right now

831
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
receive like

832
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,119
uh

833
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
okay

834
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,530
i now have a pdf

835
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,599
[Music]

836
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
okay so

837
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,839
um

838
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
and now

839
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
wouldn't it be here there is no icon on

840
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,399
my screen

841
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,320
all right you should now be able to see

842
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,800
my screen

843
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,920
hello i i don't but maybe i'm the only

844
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
one

845
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,079
no i don't either it just

846
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,800
has started screen sharing

847
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,960
okay a bunch of computer scientists try

848
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,040
to

849
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
use computers it's just

850
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,560
this is a theme

851
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,640
thank you thank you

852
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,119
all right so

853
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
yeah thank you

854
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,920
yeah yeah yeah thank you uh

855
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
you know the chinese people are not so

856
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,240
familiar with zoom also they're both of

857
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
the companies are chinese

858
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,079
uh it's a it's a city uh thanks

859
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,320
uh sorry everyone i i will be as quick

860
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,800
as as i can

861
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,560
so my my topic is about a system a

862
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,520
systematic approach an analysis of key

863
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
mismatch attacks

864
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
on net is based on needs candidate camps

865
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,839
this is joint work with my math student

866
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,240
jin yuet sang shohan and

867
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
professor panyang bing and

868
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,560
professor hule and professor jin taiting

869
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,320
yeah please go to next night

870
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,000
yeah we know nist and the department of

871
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,880
homeland security of u.s will

872
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,920
has give giving us a migration road map

873
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
to pqc

874
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,880
i think

875
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
they will give our standard

876
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,680
in the in the year of 2024 and uh

877
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
this is there will be a transition of

878
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,079
this team to need the post quantum

879
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,440
cryptography

880
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,200
in the year of 2030

881
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,280
so they

882
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,839
i think they they think that the

883
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,079
quantum computers will come in the year

884
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,800
of 2030.

885
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
uh

886
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
yeah so

887
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,119
let's go to the next slide and um

888
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,760
we can see now in the on the third round

889
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,520
pq7 standardization we have we still

890
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
have

891
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,720
five encryption or camps and

892
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,960
among them we have

893
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
uh five

894
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
five of them are based on natives and uh

895
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,599
there are three finalists we will know

896
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,800
they are kyber zebra and uh and two and

897
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,520
we

898
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,960
also have

899
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,680
two alternates and they are frodo and

900
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,079
vodka and ancho and ancient prime

901
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
so what we want to do

902
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,119
is to

903
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,160
uh

904
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,879
next snipe please

905
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,560
first we want to uh give a cryptographic

906
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,320
assessment to evaluate the key views

907
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,119
readings of these candidates in misused

908
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,800
situations

909
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
and

910
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880
we won't know in many authentication key

911
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
exchange protocols

912
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,760
we

913
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
we want to use their

914
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,520
we want to

915
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,040
uh we won't know in in our version

916
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
in

917
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,640
in this kind of uh protocols we use the

918
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,400
fo transform

919
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
can we directly

920
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,440
uh

921
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
construct cca secure versions from the

922
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,640
cpu cpu

923
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,000
cpu cpa secure runs without the effort

924
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
transform

925
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,760
in this case kvues is essential and

926
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
i think the side channel stated

927
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,440
cca attacks uh concept can successfully

928
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,400
attack against the cca secure ones

929
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
i think our

930
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,000
our work can also help in

931
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,359
in

932
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,920
improve the efficiency of these this a

933
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
attacks

934
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,440
nexus night please

935
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,400
and

936
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
can i inject really quick that you won't

937
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
be able to get through 24 slides right

938
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,800
in the time you have left yes yes we

939
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,079
will know the cpu secure

940
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,280
camps cpa cell cams and

941
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,599
next

942
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,880
what we want to say is that the k

943
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,800
mismatch attack

944
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,640
their adversary sends their deliberate

945
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,520
chosen public case and

946
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,599
they get information from the oracle

947
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,880
whether they

948
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,480
took the case from any and the svr match

949
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,920
or not if

950
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
if match it returns one else it returns

951
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,799
zero next please

952
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,240
and

953
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,839
next

954
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,359
we want to show you the our basic idea

955
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,480
from the oracle we we can give a we can

956
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,560
have a sequence of

957
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,480
uh returns they are all there there are

958
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,560
segments of signals

959
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,160
consists of zero and one so we can

960
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,480
we can transform this problem into a

961
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,079
coding problem

962
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,160
we if we want to

963
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,359
give our lower bound for the

964
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,800
for the average number of queries we can

965
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,440
transform into into given lower bound

966
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,079
for the binary recovery tree

967
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
and we know if we want to give another

968
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,920
bond for the tree we can use huffman

969
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
coding carbon coding is uh we know how

970
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,000
the coding is over timo so we can easily

971
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
get the following result in the next

972
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,560
slide

973
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
that is the

974
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,960
the lower bond can can be given we can

975
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,000
see

976
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,480
we can see this result is directly from

977
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,680
the result of the huffman coding the

978
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,119
minimum

979
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,920
expected number of queries is larger

980
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,839
than the central entropy and and

981
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
this is our main result

982
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,440
and in the next night

983
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,839
we can give an example about the

984
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,440
northbound for kyber

985
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,359
10 24

986
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,799
yeah it's about

987
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,280
2176 queries we use half my coding

988
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,800
directory

989
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,400
and in the

990
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,400
following slides we can have a uh

991
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,520
we can give her lower bounds for all the

992
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,240
please miss for what case means magic

993
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,119
attacks on what the native space nist

994
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,240
camps

995
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,280
yes

996
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
this is our one of our main results

997
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,720
and the in the following result we

998
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,000
we also

999
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,960
uh try to give some results about the

1000
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,160
practical attacks that is how we choose

1001
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,520
the security parameters to improve

1002
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,640
our

1003
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
practical attacks in the following

1004
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,160
slides

1005
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,720
you will you will have to wrap up

1006
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,599
yes

1007
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
okay okay okay what we want to say is

1008
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,760
that in the in the master master some

1009
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,720
yeah

1010
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,560
and not last one maybe

1011
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,319
directly go to the

1012
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,680
some yeah

1013
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,800
go next next place

1014
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,480
next next

1015
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,040
okay wait wait wait wait we can improve

1016
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
the uh

1017
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,599
in the chest in the chest 2020 very

1018
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,920
they gave us some work about the saturn

1019
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
attacks

1020
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,839
um

1021
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,319
uh netflix-based camps and and

1022
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,599
our result can be used directly to in

1023
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,520
improve their result

1024
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,839
please go to the next

1025
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,119
slide

1026
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,240
and we we have done some done and some

1027
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,200
some

1028
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,480
and improving put implement some

1029
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,720
our results against the kyber and the

1030
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,359
new hope and we can see we can reduce

1031
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,520
the

1032
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,200
number of queries by by nearly half

1033
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
mainly by

1034
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,920
50 percent

1035
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,839
yeah this is uh

1036
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,200
our results

1037
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,079
and thanks uh thanks

1038
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,839
all for listening thank

1039
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,640
you right i'm stopping screen sharing so

1040
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,810
i can see questions um

1041
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,319
[Music]

1042
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,599
are there

1043
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,359
uh any questions

1044
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,560
already from the audience

1045
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,880
if not then let me ask the first

1046
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,240
question

1047
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,560
so um

1048
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,720
how far are your attacks from your lower

1049
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,680
bounds like how much further can your

1050
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,319
text go

1051
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,160
uh you you mean how far you mean where

1052
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,680
guess the cpu is q1 or cj secure runs or

1053
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,960
something like this

1054
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,520
uh yeah so like the like so you you you

1055
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,119
have bounce and you have attacks and

1056
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,520
then so what's the gap between the two

1057
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,240
for some of them it's very close the gap

1058
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,440
is close

1059
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,240
but for some like new hope it's a

1060
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,359
huge gap between the theory and the

1061
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,640
practice

1062
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,800
yeah

1063
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,520
okay cool any other questions

1064
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,400
so i do have a naive one if nobody

1065
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,359
um

1066
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,240
so the lower bond you give it's as far

1067
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,000
as i understood it's for the specific

1068
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,760
attack you are considering with street

1069
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,520
and things like that so do you have any

1070
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,319
ideas how to circumvent this lower bound

1071
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,319
then i don't know what what would not

1072
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,720
fit in the model while you have a woman

1073
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,319
uh so uh you you mean how to

1074
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,000
improve the practical attacks or yeah

1075
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,240
can we what kind of attack could go

1076
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,520
below this lower bond

1077
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,079
he knows an urban you mean

1078
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,000
yeah is there a way to i mean the lower

1079
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,760
bound is only for specific class of

1080
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,480
attack right so could you

1081
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
do you have any ideas of things that

1082
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,520
would not fit into this class of attacks

1083
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,280
uh so uh we assume that we

1084
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
the the northbound is giving

1085
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
assuming that we

1086
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,800
we recover

1087
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,599
one block by one block we cover the

1088
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,480
coefficient coefficients block by block

1089
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,520
but if you can recover the coefficients

1090
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,040
uh two blocks or three blocks or

1091
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,520
yeah then you can you can maybe you can

1092
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,559
get some

1093
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,800
you can get less queries

1094
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,760
but you you need to build a

1095
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,640
a very large tree so it also

1096
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,119
becomes very difficult to build such

1097
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,000
tree

1098
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,280
yes i hope i

1099
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,960
okay yeah that's answer my question

1100
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,160
thanks yeah

1101
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,880
yeah

1102
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,520
thanks

1103
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,480
okay i think uh we have thus

1104
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,920
reached the end um of this session uh

1105
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,280
thanks everyone

1106
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,720
um in particular thanks to the speakers

1107
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,439
and the office

1108
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,640
and i think the next item on the agenda

1109
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,400
are the closing remarks in some other
