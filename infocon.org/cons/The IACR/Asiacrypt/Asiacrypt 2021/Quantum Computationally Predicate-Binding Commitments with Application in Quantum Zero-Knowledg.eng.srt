00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,440
hello everyone my name is jin yan from

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,240
china university the title of my talk

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,040
today is quantum computationally product

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,599
binding commitments with application in

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,759
quantum material knowledge arguments for

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,920
mp

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
let me first state our main results

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
we know that quantum secure when we

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
function implies quantum bit commitment

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,840
with computational binding

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,679
it is well known that with quantum

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,320
binding the committed value is no longer

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
unique it could be a superposition

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
so it it is natural to ask what happens

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
if we can recompose quantum bit

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,399
commitment in parallel

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,120
to get a string commitment

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,399
then

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
what binding property can satisfy

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
this open question turns out to be a

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,399
notoriously hard

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
and so in this work we prove the

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
following computational practice binding

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
property

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
we

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
show that any polynomial time bounded

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,360
center cannot open commitment in two

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,560
ways so as to satisfy two inconsistent

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
products respectively

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
this is the first nontrivial quantum

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
computational stream binding that is

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,200
both useful and can be instantiated with

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
the minimal complex complexity

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
assumption

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,280
and if we plug a quantum bit commitment

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
in bloom's protocol

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
we will get

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
the first quantum material knowledge

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
arguments for mp solely based on quantum

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,559
security function

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,200
and the main technical part of this work

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
that's in establishing this

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
computational practice binding property

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,840
so we make an initial step towards

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
answering this open question

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
now let me

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,720
make it in more detail

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,599
this is an alternative synopsis of my

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,640
talk

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
i will first give an overview of our

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,239
work

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,800
then i will introduce two main results

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
two main concepts

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
we introduce this work

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
namely pattern product and the product

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,640
binding

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
next i will talk about some related and

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
concurrent work

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
which is followed by latin technical

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,080
detail

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
and last is take away

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,480
so let's begin

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
an overview of this work

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
first recall bit commitment

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,360
a bit commitment scheme is a two-stage

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
interactive protocol between a sender

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
and a receiver satisfying hiding and

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
binding property

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
the hiding property states that the

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
receiver cannot guess the committed bid

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,879
during a commit stage

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,760
while binding property says the sender

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,400
cannot change the committed bit later in

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
a reveal stage

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
so bit commitment can be viewed as an

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,879
electronic realization of a locked box

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
with fundamental

78
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
studied in this work we referred will

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
allow both quantum computation and

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
quantum communication

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
this is in contrast to the classical bit

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
commitment secure against quantum

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,959
mechanics attacks

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
or post quantum

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
commitment

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
by quantum theory both of the

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
statistically hiding and statistically

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
binding quantum bit commitment is

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,560
impossible either

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,560
now let me introduce a generic quantum

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
build commitment scheme

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,680
we call it genetic because any quantum

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
bit commitment can be converted into

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
this form

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
it can be represented by an example of

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,480
unitary quantum circuit pair q0q1

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
to commit a bit b

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
the sender will

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
first of perform qb

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,599
a unitary circuit could be on quantum

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
registers c and r

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,639
which

103
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,440
consists of a bunch of qubits

104
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
initialized in state 0.

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
after performing qb c and r will be

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
entangled somehow

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
in a commit stage the sender will send

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
the commitment register c to the

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,680
receiver

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
i will say the scheme is hiding if the

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
state of c look the same whether a bit

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
zero is committed or a bit wines

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
committed

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
later in a reveal stage the sender will

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
send the commitment register r

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
together with the bit b to the receiver

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
who will apply the inverse of qb on cnr

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
to check

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
if they return to all zero states

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
the cell scheme is binding or onis

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
binding equivalently

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,919
if any polynomial time bounding center

123
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
cannot open an honest commitment to b at

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,758
the y minus b

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
this quantum bit commitment scheme of

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
the genetic form has several nice

127
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
properties

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,039
at first it is non-interactive

129
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,440
illustrates that as both last commit

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,280
under the real stage

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,960
a single quantum message is sent

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
second it can be based on quantum scale

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
1 functions

134
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
third its semi-online security implies

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,720
the full security

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
so that's why only honest binding and

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
finding equivalent

138
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
fourth it is information theoretic

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
street binding

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
in a sense that the opening through the

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
entanglement is unique

142
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
uh this property will play an important

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
role in our conjunctions

144
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,080
uh as you shall be seen later

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,919
and there may be more

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,400
nice properties are waiting for us to

147
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
discover

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
it is well known that

149
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
the general binding of qbc is weak

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,240
at least because a cheating sender may

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
mount the following supervising

152
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
superpartition tag

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
it can commit to a superposition

154
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,720
of 000 1 in an arbitrary way

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
this f0 and f1 can be tuned actually

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
in this regard the committed value is no

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
longer classically unique

158
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,120
possibly a superposition

159
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
and the understanding of binding when

160
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
the qpc is composed in parallel to

161
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,719
commit as gene is notoriously hard

162
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe the most famous application of bit

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,039
commitments

164
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,120
are zero knowledge

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,360
here uh let's see a bloom still on

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,039
knowledge blood code

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
approver wants to convince the verifier

168
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,479
that the common input graph contains a

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,720
hamiltonian cycle

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
to this end the prover will first sense

171
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
commitments of pi g to the verifier

172
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
where pi is a randomly chosen

173
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
permutation

174
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
the one fire will then respond with a

175
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,679
challenge either zero or one

176
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
and last

177
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
when a bit b is zero challenge is zero

178
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,639
the plural will center the permutation

179
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
pi plus keys to open all commitments

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
so that the verifier will check the open

181
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
graph is ended by g

182
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
in the other case

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
when a bit b is 1 the prover will try to

184
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,759
open a hamiltonian cycle

185
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,160
and the verifier will check that indeed

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
a hamiltonian cycle is opened

187
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
so a main question that motivates this

188
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
work is as follows

189
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
we ask ourselves the following question

190
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
what happens if we plug a generic

191
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
statistically hiding computationally

192
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,319
binary qpc scheme in bronze plotcom

193
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,720
this is not trivial to answer by noting

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
that the quantum rewinding is generally

195
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
impossible and the quantum binding is

196
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,559
generally weak

197
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,039
but

198
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,599
this question is important because

199
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
because if it is possible

200
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
then we have several benefits

201
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
first it can reduce the number of rounds

202
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,440
from polynomial to just three solely

203
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
based on quantum security function

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
thanks to the non-interactivity of the

205
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
qpc

206
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,519
second at least can circumvent barriers

207
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,160
only known for classical constructions

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
thanks to the information theoretic

209
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,240
strict minded of the qbc

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
after some exploration we have both good

211
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
news and bad news

212
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,720
good news is watchers rewind internet

213
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,279
works as well towards establishing the

214
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,000
statistical geological property

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,920
in our setting

216
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,399
and the bad news is the weak binding of

217
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
qbc may deteriorate the computational

218
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
soundness

219
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,959
this is because it could be a

220
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
superposition of exponentially many

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,519
graphs committed by the receiver

222
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
to answer these questions we obtain our

223
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
results

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
as follows let me restated it

225
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
we composed a generic computationally

226
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
binding quantum bit commitment scheme in

227
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
parallel which gives rise to a quantum

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
string commitment scheme such that it

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
satisfy a non-trivial computational

230
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,240
binding

231
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
we call practice binding property

232
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
and it can be used to establish the

233
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
security of bloom's protocol

234
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,839
okay

235
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
in the second part of the talk let me

236
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,640
introduce two important concepts i will

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
introduce in this work

238
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
namely pattern predict and predict

239
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
binding and they are motivated by the

240
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,000
soundness analysis of bloom's protocol

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,079
the motivation of pattern predict if

242
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,959
uh improves protocol and verifies final

243
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,320
verification

244
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
induces two predicts

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
corresponding to two different

246
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
challenges

247
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,720
this impact is by us to

248
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,839
define

249
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
pattern predict as follows

250
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,360
informally first gene str to satisfy a

251
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,079
pattern predict it should exhibit a

252
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
certain pattern somewhere

253
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
formally it is given by a triplet of

254
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
polynomial time algorithms

255
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,079
where t and s

256
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
such that are given a witness w

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,320
the errors algorithm will check its

258
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,079
validity

259
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
a tw will output a subset

260
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
which indicates which portion of the

261
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
string is to examine

262
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
and sw is just just a pattern to

263
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,600
check

264
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
so for string to satisfy a pattern

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
predict p

266
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
if there exists a witness w

267
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
such that w is valid

268
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,000
and the projection of str on tw is just

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,959
the pattern sw

270
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,760
we highlight that here the witness w may

271
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
not be computable in polynomial time

272
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
given as g

273
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
str

274
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
and i will remark that

275
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
our patent predict contains the

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
polynomial time decidable predict

277
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
as a special case

278
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
and now let's see

279
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
how this pattern predict connect to the

280
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,920
products induced by bloom's protocol

281
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,480
corresponding uh to zero a challenge

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,839
zero uh

283
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
when we define practice p zero

284
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
as follows

285
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
all right the witness is just the

286
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
permutation

287
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
and the t

288
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
on input

289
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
pi

290
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
we are simply

291
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
outputting the whole set because

292
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
all bit commitments are to open

293
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,800
and s on input pi will output pi g

294
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,959
and the permutated graph to check

295
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
corresponding to the challenge 1

296
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
the project p1 is as follows as witness

297
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,240
is just a hamiltonian cycle

298
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
and t on input h

299
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
will output coordinates corresponding to

300
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
h of h

301
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,200
and sh will output all ones because

302
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
edges are corresponds to one it adjacent

303
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,720
the matrix of the input graph

304
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
so uh

305
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
the motivation of practical binding with

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,079
quantum formalization is as follows

307
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,120
uh

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
in bloom's protocol uh

309
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
the two predicts of the verifier induces

310
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
two projectors or subspaces

311
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,800
as follows

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
corresponding to the challenge zero

313
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,199
the qualifiers

314
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,760
operation is a binary projective

315
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,120
measurement

316
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
represented by project p0

317
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
of list4

318
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
basically it requires that whenever the

319
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
inpu the permutations pi

320
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,560
then

321
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,120
orbit commitments should be opened at pi

322
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
g

323
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,399
recall that the quantum circuit to

324
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,320
commuters gene s is given by

325
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
the tensor

326
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
product of qsi

327
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
this is because

328
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,399
we commit a string in a bit wide version

329
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
corresponding to the challenge1 the

330
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
measurement

331
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,160
is represented by the project p1 of this

332
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,120
form

333
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
basically it requires that whenever the

334
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
hamiltonian cycle locates at age

335
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,160
then all with commitments determined by

336
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,120
age

337
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
and should be opened as all ones

338
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
here other registers for the commitment

339
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,519
check are not fixed they are determined

340
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
by age

341
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
for some needs we need to show that

342
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
subspaces p0 is almost orthogonal to p1

343
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,800
up to any efficiently realizable view

344
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,639
that unless performing on a space

345
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,000
subspace induced by registers other than

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
commitment registers

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,639
namely the u does not touch the

348
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,320
commitment register

349
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,320
c

350
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,240
so this inspires us to

351
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
define predict binding as follows

352
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
that p0p1 to be

353
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
two inconsistent predicts namely any

354
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
string can satisfy at most one of them

355
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,360
pictorially p0 and p1

356
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
do not intersect

357
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,519
for example in bloom's protocol predicts

358
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,720
p1 are inconsistent when the input graph

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,800
g is not hamiltonian

360
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
informally

361
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,880
product binding with respect to p0 p1 if

362
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
the sender can open commitments so that

363
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
the reward value possibly a

364
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
superposition satisfy p0 with

365
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,279
probability 1

366
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,079
then

367
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
the sender cannot open the same

368
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
commitments so that the revealed value

369
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
satisfies p1 with a non-negligible

370
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,000
probability

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
now this is the formula given by this

372
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
quantity of non-negligible be negligible

373
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,360
list c is an arbitrary state

374
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,279
then on which we first apply p0

375
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
followed by lending efficiently

376
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,160
realizable u that does not charge

377
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,360
commitments which is followed by p1

378
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
and the resulting vector should be

379
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,839
navigable

380
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,720
we say practice binding

381
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
if a periodic binding with respect to

382
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,360
any pair of inconsistent predicts

383
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
our main result is the parallel

384
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,199
composition of a generic computationally

385
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,079
binding quantum bit commitment scheme

386
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,720
gives rise to a quantum computationally

387
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
predicted binary string commitment

388
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,799
scheme

389
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,880
there are two characters

390
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
for our results

391
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,919
at first

392
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,039
the qpc scheme is of the generic form

393
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,400
which is easy to handle technically

394
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
second

395
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,360
we actually did not prove the full

396
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
orbiting binding

397
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
namely with respect to an arbitrary

398
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,760
inconsistent consistent vertical pair

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,480
rather we require that for at least one

400
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,440
product

401
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
a fixed portion of the strings is needed

402
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
to check in order to decide whether

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,559
students satisfy this predict

404
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,240
anyway okay

405
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,320
our practical binding is more than

406
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
enough for our application

407
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
and we expect it and can be further

408
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
extended to the full practice binding

409
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,440
in the future

410
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
and now let me mention some related and

411
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,720
concurrent work

412
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,080
previously we know nothing about the

413
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
binding of the parallelization of a

414
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,960
general qpc that is computationally

415
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
binding

416
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,840
uru studied class collapse binding qpc

417
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
but a general qpc cannot be collapse

418
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,960
binding

419
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,200
previously some kind of string

420
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
commitments with a specific

421
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
computational binding properties

422
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,400
that are useful were proposed

423
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
including f binding and q by d

424
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,360
but however

425
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
neither of them can be instantiated with

426
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,120
well-funded assumptions

427
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
there are also two concurrent works

428
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
which also realize quantum bit

429
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
commitment with simpler exchanged

430
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
quantum states and with more desirable

431
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
properties than ours

432
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,039
including extractability and

433
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,799
equivocality

434
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,080
however

435
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,799
and

436
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
and they are solely based on quantum

437
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,679
secure runway functions

438
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
and these properties may result in wider

439
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
applications in theory

440
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,760
however

441
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,039
they achieve

442
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,960
better properties

443
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
at the cost of extremely high load

444
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,720
complexity at the highest polynomial

445
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
number of rounds

446
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
and layer constructions are more complex

447
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
than our quantum big commitment scheme

448
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
of the genetic form

449
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
now let me talk about some technical

450
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
detail that was

451
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,559
establishing a practical binding

452
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
in one sentence we find a more clever

453
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,400
way to sum possibly exponentially many

454
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
terms within a superposition to overcome

455
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,200
the general exponential curse

456
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
so

457
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,600
i will give a pictorial illustration

458
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,120
it turns out that our goal is to bound

459
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,919
a superposition of this form

460
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,799
this is a projection on p1

461
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
of a superposition

462
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,240
that satisfies p0

463
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,120
we view it at the root of a binary g

464
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,120
for each each term in a superposition it

465
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
can be read as a leaf

466
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
of this binary tree

467
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,960
and bind a quantum bit on its binding

468
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
each leaf can be bound by the binding

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
along epsilon

470
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
if we try to bound our goal

471
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
through all these leaves by simply a

472
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
coin calling

473
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
a triangle inequality of the wet node

474
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
then since they are exponentially mainly

475
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
this may

476
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
incur an exponential

477
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,000
multiple multiplicative factor

478
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
which is intolerable

479
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,880
in security analysis

480
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,679
so

481
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
for our purpose

482
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,360
we we need to take another branch

483
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
specifically we shall bound each

484
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,400
internal node where it's two children's

485
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,320
for this root is left child corresponds

486
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,679
to the

487
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,799
superposition and let's satisfy p0

488
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,520
and with prefix 0

489
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,440
for its red child uh it is changed with

490
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
prefix one

491
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
it turns out that we can buy the root by

492
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
the summation of its two children

493
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
plus an additive error epsilon

494
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,360
using a triangle inequality and quantum

495
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,158
bit on its binding

496
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
in turn

497
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
each of these two child can finally be

498
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
bounded by their children respectively

499
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
list for example this left child can be

500
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,640
bound

501
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
by its left child with prefix

502
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,640
zero zero and its right child is prefix

503
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
zero one

504
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,559
and its red child bounded by its left

505
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,919
child with prefix one zero and its red

506
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
child which prefix one one

507
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
plus another

508
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,600
additive

509
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,400
arrow epsilon

510
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
we can bound

511
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,760
through this piece from the root to the

512
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
in this way

513
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,880
and it turns out that

514
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,720
the error can only close linearly in the

515
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
depths of this tree

516
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,840
so

517
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
in this way we

518
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,559
we can find this by a negligible

519
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
probability of

520
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
quantity

521
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
the

522
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,960
takeaway would like to mention two

523
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,919
points

524
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,120
the first

525
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
our work showed that a genetic

526
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
computationally binding onto bit

527
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,799
commitment scheme

528
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
for the binding is very weak but which

529
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
has several nice properties that

530
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,520
classical computationally binding bit

531
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,679
commitments do not have

532
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,279
and could be useful in quantum

533
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,919
cryptography

534
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,120
second

535
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
it is nontrivial to establish the

536
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
binding property of the parallel

537
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,760
composition of a computationally binding

538
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
on a bit commitment scheme

539
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,080
okay this is the end of my talk thanks

540
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,399
for your listening
