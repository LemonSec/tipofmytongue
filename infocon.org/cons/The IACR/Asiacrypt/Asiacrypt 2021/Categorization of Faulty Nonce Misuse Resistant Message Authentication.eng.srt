welcome to the presentation

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,480
categorization of 40 months misused

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759

i'm the speaker julian chen

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,079
this paper was co-authored with

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,080
machining and smart menu

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,880
the story of non-space mega algorithms

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
starts with work of hmis culture in 1981

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
where they process the message

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,320
with universal hash function and the

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
input box with the function f

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
and then the xor the output of the

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,120
universal hash function with the output

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
of the function f and to generate output

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
tag of the construction

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
the worksheet is built on the early work

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
of gilbert macmillan's and so on in

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
1974.

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
we can show that if f is a secure pif

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
then the resulting construction achieves

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,840
n bit security

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
however there are two concerns about

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
this construction

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,159
the first one is that there are not so

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
many well analyzed dedicated pifs in the

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,560
world

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
so usually we choose to implement f as a

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
block cipher

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
in that case the resulting construction

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,159
is called the way called super

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,520
construction

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
which achieves 85 by 2 bits per second

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
security

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,119
the second concern is that

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,920
the construction strictly depends on the

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
input nodes

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,360
in the case of a single node's

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
repetition the construction is totally

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
broken

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,240
in order to solve the above mentioned

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
problem of lady and surrey introduced in

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
2016

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
the construction encrypted swahili

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
partner with davis men

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
they show that construction achieves 2

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
and divided by 3-bit security in the

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
north's respecting setting

48
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
and still burst upon security in the

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,239
case of most missile system

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,959
one year later manningham neighbors

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,080
shows that

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,720
ethereum ctm actually achieved

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,280
achieved ambit security in the most

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,959
respecting setting

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,760
but their proof is based on open their

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,959
proof is based on an unverified version

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
of the new theory

58
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
again one year later the diatribe

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,239
proposed the following of section ewcdm

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
where d means for equipment

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
instead of um you see an independent key

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,239
in the second block cypher power of

63
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,800
ewcdm

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
eta pcdm uses inverse of the box iphone

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
call

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
but based on the same key as the first

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
one

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
both cwcdm and type of ctm

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
has the property that's

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,519
in the case of a non-supercondition the

71
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
security drops to the birthday bonds

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
in order to improve the security

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,560
the title introduced a foreign

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,519
construction in 2019.

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
this construction is the non-space

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,599
variant of ehtm

77
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,840
and minamatsu in

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
2010 in order to prove the security of

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
this construction

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,360
that will produce the faulty noise model

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
where they call a very faulty if it's a

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,319
mcquery that uses the repeated numbers

83
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,239
what's interesting about the

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
construction is the construction

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
achieves actually

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
something that we call squeeze for

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
security degradation

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
that means that

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
in the case of loss repetition the

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
security of this construction will not

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,920
immediately drop to the birthday part

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,959
however

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
the construction will drop

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
with the function that's

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,600
um it depends on the number of four big

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
queries

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
so

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
the alters show that

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
the different construction achieves two

100
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,600
n divided 5x3 with security if the

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,639
number of 40 queries is below 2 to the

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
power 85.3

103
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,400
by a later choice i'll improve the

104
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
security and show that actually this

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
construction achieved three indefined by

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
four bit security if the number of 40

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,320
queries is below

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
2 to the power 3 and divided by 8.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
we see that both inner presidium and

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
this noise-based

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,880
ehtm construction

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
uses two

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
and two block cypher calls and one

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
universe a hash function evaluation

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
we wonder whether we can build

116
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
construction

117
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,199
with the same cost but achieve a similar

118
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,440
or better security

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
before we give an answer to this

120
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
question we first want to define the

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
security definition that was used in

122
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
this work

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
we focus on prf security

124
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,840
so we define attack game

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
at the beginning of the game

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
one of the two words is chosen

127
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,639
the real world

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,000
on the left side and the ideal ones on

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
the right side

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,479
the construction

131
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,960
oracle in the real world is

132
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
our construction which is fx

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
while the ideal world oracle is a random

134
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
function

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
so the activist three a makes q queries

136
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
to the given oracle

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
and we ask that a will not repeat its

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
query since we're asking the same inputs

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,960
it will get the same output

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
and after ace communication with the

141
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
oracle it should state

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
which of the two worlds it was given

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
access to

144
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,639
if a cannot do so then we can deduce

145
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,400
that the different construction is a

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,359
secure pif

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
we will first start with the simple

148
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,280
results

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,600
we want to build all mpm bits pifs with

150
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
just using two block cipher calls

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
for the framework shown in this slides

152
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
we can see there are in total 2 to the

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
power 6 constructions that can be viewed

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
however many of those are just trivially

155
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,039
insecure

156
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
the following four requirements are

157
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
needed to guarantee the security of the

158
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
cross function

159
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,319
for example

160
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
if a11 is not equal to one and there's

161
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
no inputs to the first box either

162
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
if a33 is not equal to 1

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
then the output of the second box hyphen

164
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
doesn't have influence on the cross

165
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,440
section

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
the sum of a2 2 and a3 2

167
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,840
and not

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
must be at least one

169
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,680
then

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
yeah

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,000
the um

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
the output the output of the first block

173
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,120
cipher doesn't have influence on the

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
construction

175
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,639
same as before a two one plus a two two

176
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,120
must be at least one because otherwise

177
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
there's no inputs

178
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,319
to the second box either

179
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,520
so

180
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
keep in mind that we are only interested

181
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
in beyond perceived but secure pifs

182
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
with those information in mind we are

183
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
able to drive the following lots of

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,120
surprisingly results on the construction

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
that we can build

186
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
on two block cipher calls

187
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
at the south fermentation construction

188
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
babylonia until in 1998

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,240
encrypted davis manual construction by

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
graham d and sarah in 2016

191
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
and encrypted device manager dual

192
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
construction by many kind of neighbors

193
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,680
in 2017.

194
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
those are the constructions that already

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
known i'm in

196
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
the

197
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
previous work

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
and

199
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
they are actually shown to achieve and

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,679
put security

201
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,679
in the um

202
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,319
security

203
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,600
beside those constructions

204
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
there are natural draw variants

205
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,880
which we can obtain by according inputs

206
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,399
to the outputs

207
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,720
also achieve the same amount of security

208
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
now based on those information we are

209
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
able to get one step further and

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
go to

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
the design of noise-based mac algorithms

212
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,000
now we try to build mac algorithms using

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
two blocks cipher constant one universal

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
hash function evaluation

215
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,000
we see the framework in the slides that

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
we evaluates the message uh using

217
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
universal hash function and

218
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
puts the output of the info so hash

219
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
function

220
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
xor it's and yeah the outputs can be

221
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
executed at any moment

222
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,360
of the

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
of the construction

224
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
there are in total truth our line of

225
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,279
sections that can be built

226
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
however as before many of those

227
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,760
constructions actually fairly insecure

228
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
besides the

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,640
previously mentioned four conditions we

230
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
also required that

231
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
at least one of that

232
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,200
b values must be one because otherwise

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,519
um the outputs of the

234
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
universe flash is not accurate to the

235
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
construction

236
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,519
so after our analysis it seems that

237
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,360
there are a total of 10 interesting

238
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,440
constructions left

239
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
we have five of those are based on edm

240
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,399
three are based on sop

241
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,920
and two of those are based on edmd

242
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
um in this slides

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
i will show you the three of those

244
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,640
hand constructions where the trees are

245
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,560
the special which monoculture

246
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,680
reconstructions that are based on sop

247
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,440
edm and edmd respectively

248
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,279
as mentioned before

249
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,680
vehicle other constructions

250
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
have amp its security in the case of

251
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
most respecting settings

252
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
that are totally broken in the case of

253
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
single bonds we use

254
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
so what remains over are the seven

255
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,279
constructions where four are based on

256
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
edm two are based on sop and last one is

257
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
based on edm

258
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
we'll start we'll first start with

259
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
construction space on edm

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
those two constructions based on edm are

261
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
ewcdm interference of ewcem

262
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
we can show that those two cross

263
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,600
sections

264
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
achieve three and defined by four bit

265
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
security in most respective settings

266
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,440
and this time we can prove the security

267
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
with a complete verifiable proof

268
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
unfortunately the constructions

269
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
do not enjoy risk for security

270
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
degradation

271
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
that means that

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
in the case of a single loss repetition

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
the security of the constructions drops

274
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,040
to

275
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,800
and divide by 2-bit percent

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
the following two

277
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
instructions based on edm

278
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,079
which is much more interesting

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because they achieved three identified

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
by four bit security as long as the

281
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
number of 40 queries is below 2 to the

282
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
power and defined by 2

283
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
which is actually

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,959
let's actually means that stipple

285
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,079
sections

286
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,638
do enjoy squeeze for security validation

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
the following two constructions based on

288
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
sop

289
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
are the non-space variants of e-htm

290
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,280
interference of this

291
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
[Music]

292
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
we can show that most constructions

293
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
achieve three independent by 4-bit

294
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,079
security

295
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,639
as long as the number of 40 queries is

296
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
below 2 to the power 3 and divided by 8.

297
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
they both also enjoy graceful security

298
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
integration

299
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,519
the last construction is the one based

300
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
song edmv

301
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
this is very special construction

302
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,120
since

303
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,279
we don't yeah

304
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
out the output of the first block cipher

305
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,360
is not known

306
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
because of this reason

307
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
it makes outputs of the second block

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
cipher also unknown since the second

309
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
peroxide and output the output of the

310
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
second plot cycle is equal to the xor of

311
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,399
the output of the first block cipher

312
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,440
with

313
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,079
an output twitch t and we only know the

314
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,880
value of t

315
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,920
because of those reasons it makes it

316
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
impossible to apply

317
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
currently known techniques such as meal

318
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
theory

319
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,720
to

320
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,959
prove the beyond first about security of

321
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
the construction in the most respecting

322
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
setting

323
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
that's the reason why we will leave it

324
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,830
for as an open question for the future

325
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,839
[Music]

326
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,279
research still want to say something

327
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,399
about our security analysis

328
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,760
in this work we use the

329
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,560
potential as edge coefficient technique

330
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
the technique is actually

331
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
formalized in the slide i'm not

332
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
going to explain it in detail but i just

333
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,279
want to say in this work we use the

334
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,320
advanced meal theory to obtain this

335
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
epsilon

336
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
and we can apply address mu theory by

337
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,000
transforming the trends and the query

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
transcripts into a transcript graph

339
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
where the graph should satisfy the

340
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
following properties

341
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
the first one is that graph shouldn't

342
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
contain any circles

343
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
and the graph shouldn't contain any

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,199
cellular path labels

345
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,000
while using up of two mesh properties we

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
are able to define the band at events

347
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
and then we can bounce probability that

348
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
bad events

349
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
happens in the

350
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
happen in the ideal world

351
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,040
in the following slides we

352
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,839
you see a table that

353
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,560
four and 10 constructions

354
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
and we can see that most interesting one

355
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
are those six constructions with three

356
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
amplified f4 bits security

357
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,639
the first two construction space on edm

358
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,000
that's b2 and b3 transaction

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
and for the previous work we already

360
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
know that those constructions

361
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,000
can be optimal and bit secure

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,759
the main reason that we

363
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
only have three nd5 but security is

364
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
because

365
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
because of the limitation of the new

366
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,160
theory

367
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
so we hope that the security can be of

368
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,519
those two constructions can be improved

369
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
in the future using an improved version

370
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
of new theory or by using some other

371
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
stronger proof technique

372
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
the other four constructions are the

373
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,639
most interesting one since they all

374
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
enjoy risk for security degradation

375
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
those constructions are

376
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,440
and also show in this slide

377
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
where the first two are based on edm and

378
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
are serial protections it's

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,079
um

380
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,560
related to actually battle parallel

381
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,880
construction space on sop

382
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,120
those four constructions all achieved

383
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
three nt5 bits security

384
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,360
we are not aware whether this 385x4 bit

385
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,399
security is tight or not that's because

386
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
of the presence

387
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
of the alternating

388
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,600
automating path of longer length in the

389
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
transcript graph

390
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
so i'll just leave it as an open

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
question for the future research

392
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,360
for conclusion in this work we perform

393
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,839
an exhaustive search of all pifs that

394
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,720
can be built by toolbox title calls

395
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,359
based on this result we perform

396
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
exhaustive search for mac algorithms

397
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,640
that can

398
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
be built funds when we first saw harsh

399
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,559
evaluation and two block typhoon calls

400
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
after that we perform a beyond per se

401
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
bonds pif security analysis of the

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,079
perceptions in the 14 oz model

403
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,000
for the future as already mentioned

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
before it will be very interesting to

405
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
look at the tightness of the security

406
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,520
bonds

407
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
one of the research topics that can be

408
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,679
done is to prove the giant person about

409
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,039
security of that smack algorithm that

410
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,760
was based on edmd in the most respecting

411
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
setting

412
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
but since our analysis was done for the

413
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
prf security only it will also be very

414
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
interesting to look at the max security

415
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
of the given constructions

416
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
so this is the end of my presentation i

417
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,280
want to thank you for your attention
