00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
hello everyone

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,480
i am srimati bhattacharya and i am going

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,040
to present our work titled lubiraka

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
backwards with more users and more

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
security this is a joint work with

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
mridul nandi

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
the stock is broadly divided into three

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,199
parts i will start by motivating prfs

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,439
and their multi-user security

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,800
then i will cover some technical

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
background and state our results and

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
finally i will

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,559
give a brief sketch of the proof of one

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,919
of our main results

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,360
primary motivation of our work

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,879
comes from the importance of

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
pseudorandom functions they are quite

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
important cryptographic primitives

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,559
and

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
are used for quite a lot of

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,520
cryptographic tasks

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
now a pertinent question is how do we

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,600
get them how do we get good prfs

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,319
in the domain of symmetric cryptography

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
it is known that there are good block

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
ciphers

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
there are good block cipher

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
constructions which are modeled as

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
pseudo random permutations

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,040
now can we use them as prfs can you use

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
a prp as a prf it is known that an n bit

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
prf can be distinguished from an n bit

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
prp with order of 2 to the n over 2

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
queries

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,560
and this is known as birthday bound

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
now is it possible to go beyond this

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,079
birthday barrier

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,600
that is is it possible uh to use prps to

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
come up with a construction that

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,799
requires a large number of queries

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,479
ideally order of two to the end many

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
queries to distinguish it from a

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
pseudo-random function

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
this question is

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
practically important and theoretically

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
challenging

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,119
and

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
it was treated for the first time

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,360
formally by billare and others and

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
they turned this problem looby rackoff

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
backwards

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
because ruby and rakoff in their seminal

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,439
work considered the converse problem

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,719
they considered the problem of

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,479
converting prfs into prps

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,318
sum of permutations is a well-known

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,760
construction in the literature which

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
converts a prp into a prf to describe

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
the construction let rp be a random

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
permutation on 0 1 to the n

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
now the basic version of the

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,680
construction denoted by xor p

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,319
it takes ah

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,120
it takes an input of length n minus one

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
and it maps it to two distinct

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
inputs ah to the random permutation and

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519
where is the random permutation r p at

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,040
those two inputs

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
and takes the sum of the corresponding

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
outputs

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
so so xor p is a mapping from 0 1 to the

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
n minus 1 to 0 1 to the n

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
a series of works led to this result

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,440
that xor p is secure up to order of two

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
to the n many queries that is at least

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
order of two three n mini queries uh is

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,599
required to distinguish x rp from a

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
pseudorandom function

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
now this simple construction can be

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,319
generalized in various in various ways

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
xrp 3

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
in this construction this random

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
permutation is queried at 3 distinct

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
points and

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
the output is the sum of the

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,040
corresponding

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,599
outputs

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,480
so xor p 3 is a mapping from 0 1 to the

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
n minus 2 to 0 1 to the n

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
and

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,159
there is there are a few works that

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,920
implies that uh xor p three x is secure

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,159
up to order of two to the n many queries

94
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
also be generalized into an efficient

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
version uh

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
denoted by xor p dash three

97
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
ah which

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
requires five

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,879
calls to the random permutation ah to

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,680
produce twin bit output

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
so it is efficient because it requires

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
one

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
less block cipher call for twin bit

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,239
output

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
now ah

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
there is a

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
ah series of works that

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
that shows that this construction is

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
also secure up to order of 2 to the n

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
many queries

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
now in general one can think of

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,199
xor p k and xor p dash k for arbitrary

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
value of k in fact some of the results

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
that we have cited earlier

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,800
ah were derived for general value of k

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,680
but

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
in this work our focus will be for the

118
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
case k equal to 3 and this sum of

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
permutations construction

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,639
has been practically used in c n c p mac

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,440
plus and z mac

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
now this results look satisfactory

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,720
because in each case

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
the construction is secure up to order

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
of two to the nbn queries

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
however

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
ah

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
when when the construction is used in a

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
multi-user scenario where each user has

130
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
an independent copy of the construction

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
and the adversary can

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
query the users

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,520
possibly adaptively so if there are eu

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
users and

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
the adversary can

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,280
make q max many queries per users

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,960
then by a standard hybrid reduction

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
it can be argued

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
that

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
xor pk

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
is secure when the number of users is of

142
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,600
the order of 2 to the n over 2 and the

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
number of queries per user is also of

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
the same order

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
now ah

146
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,199
for the specific case of aes which is

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
which has block length to 128 bit

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
it can be argued that it is secure

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
when the product u into q max is

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
of the order 2 to the

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,319
96 assuming that the advantage is of the

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
order 1 over 2 to the 32

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
now with the

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
rapid growth of internet and other

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
relevant technologies this margin looks

156
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
pretty vulnerable

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
so a possible fix that comes to mind is

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,919
increasing the block length of the

159
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,479
cipher but block ciphers like aes which

160
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,540
are which is widely available

161
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,680
[Music]

162
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
it comes with a fixed block link so we

163
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,880
cannot

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
increase the block length of the cipher

165
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
so in such a state

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
one of our results

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,039
implies

168
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
that x or p 3 is secure even when the

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
number of users is of the order 2 to the

170
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,800
n

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,759
and

172
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,039
q max is also of the same order

173
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,440
now this is a substantial improvement

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,319
over

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
the order of 2 to the n over 2 bound

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,840
that we have discussed previously

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,479
in the single user setting this result

178
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
implies that

179
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
the adversary's advantage is negligible

180
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
even after making order of two to the n

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
many queries and to the best of our

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,479
knowledge this result is novel in the

183
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
literature

184
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
what we have also shown is that the

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,840
efficient version xorpedas

186
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,080
provides same level of security

187
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,240
so

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,599
to discuss

189
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
or to

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,759
state our results in more precise terms

191
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,360
we require some technical background

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
and we start with the

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
notion of indistinguishability in the

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
single user setting

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,039
so

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,000
to describe this notion let

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,319
function be the state of all functions

198
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,680
from 0 1 to the n minus 2 to 0 1 to the

199
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
n and permian be the set of all

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
permutations from 0 1 to the n to 0 1 to

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
the n

202
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
so ah

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,400
we will

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
restrict

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,599
our discussion to the construction xrp3

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
so in the security game the adversary

207
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
interacts either with the construction

208
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
xor p3

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
it's constructed using the random

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
permutation rp

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,039
or it

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
interacts with the random function

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
drawn from the set function

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,479
when the adversary queries with an x in

215
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
0 1 to the n minus 2

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
in the real world it

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
receives the output of the construction

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,839
xor p3 and in the ideal world it gets a

219
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,839
random element of 0 1 to the n

220
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
and at the end of the entire interaction

221
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
it outputs a single bit

222
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
so we quantify the security of the

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
construction

224
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
by the advantage of the adversary which

225
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
is the absolute difference

226
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
between the probabilities

227
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
uh that the adversary outputs one when

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
it's interacting with the construction

229
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
and

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
the probability that it outputs one when

231
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
it's interacting with the random

232
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
function

233
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,920
the probabilities are taken over the

234
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
randomness in the real and the ideal

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
world and any randomness used by the

236
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,760
adversary

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
now since our focus is on the

238
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
information theoretic security

239
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
we assume that the adversary is

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
computationally unbounded

241
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
so

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
without loss of generality we can assume

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
that it runs with the best coins

244
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
so we assume that it is deterministic

245
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
the only restriction we place on the

246
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
adversary is that we restrict it to

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,160
making q many queries

248
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
and

249
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
so without loss of generality we assume

250
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
that it doesn't repeat any query because

251
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,240
it when it repeats a query it will get

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
back the same reply

253
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
under these conditions ah when when the

254
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,640
transcript in the real world is given by

255
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,839
this tuple p 1 to p q

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,079
and that in the ideal world is given by

257
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,839
the table

258
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,000
r 1 to r q which follows the

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
distributions p

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,959
ah prp and prr then

261
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,920
the adversary's advantage can be shown

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
to be upper bounded ah by the

263
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
statistical distance between the these

264
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,800
two distributions

265
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
multi-user indistinguishability

266
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
so for this ah

267
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,720
let func u n be the set of all functions

268
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
from box u

269
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,360
cross

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
0 1 to the n minus 2 to 0 1 to the n

271
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
and r f is a

272
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
randomly chosen member of from this set

273
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,360
and also rp1 to rpu

274
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,560
uh

275
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,839
are drawn

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
uniformly at random uh from the set

277
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
power min so power mean is the set of

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,279
all permutations over 0 1 to the n and

279
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,360
rp1 to rpu are independently drawn

280
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
so

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
in the security game

282
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
in the real world we have this

283
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
construction x or p 3 u this is this is

284
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,000
this is

285
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,680
ah

286
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
r xrp 3 in the multi-user setting where

287
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
there there are there are you many users

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
and

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,320
in the ideal world uh

290
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,680
we have this random function drawn from

291
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,640
the set func you win

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
when the adversary makes a query ix

293
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
in the real world

294
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
it receives the output

295
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
of xor p 3 when the underlying random

296
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
permutation is rpi

297
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
and in the in the ideal world it

298
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,600
receives a random element of 0 1 to the

299
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
n

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
and in the end of the entire interaction

301
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,760
it outputs a bit

302
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,880
so like in the single user setting we

303
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
quantify the

304
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
security of the construction by

305
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
adversary's advantage which is the

306
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
absolute difference between the

307
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
probabilities

308
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
when

309
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
the adversary is interacting with the

310
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,920
construction and

311
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,760
when it is interacting

312
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
with the random function

313
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,360
and similar to the single user setting

314
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
the probabilities are taken

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
over the randomness in the real and

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,560
ideal world as well as

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,199
any randomness used by the adversary

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
so

319
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
here in this

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
multi-user setting we allow a to make

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
qmax

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
many queries to each user

323
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
so so

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,240
our assumption was that

325
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
a makes at most q max mini queries to

326
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
each user now we are allowing it to make

327
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
exactly q max mini queries to each user

328
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
so we are giving more advantage to the

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
adversary and

330
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
all it will do is that the bound we will

331
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
get

332
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
will be will be worst case bound

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
so

334
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
now the total number of queries is given

335
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
by q max into u

336
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
we also assume that is square is to the

337
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
same user or distinct because it if it

338
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
repeats the query it will get back the

339
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,079
same reply

340
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
and we also assumed

341
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
that each user holds an independent copy

342
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
of the random permutation

343
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,320
ah

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
so reply a reply given by the e given by

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
each user will be independent

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
so under these conditions if ah the real

347
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
world transcript is given by p 1 to p q

348
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
and the ideal word transcript is given

349
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
by r 1 to r q

350
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
then the multi user advantage

351
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
multi user prf advantage of the

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
adversary

353
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,959
can be shown to be upper bounded by the

354
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,360
statistical distance between the

355
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,680
these two distributions prp and prr

356
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,440
now we state our main results formally

357
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,399
so our first result is a

358
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,240
multi-user prf advantage of the

359
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,720
construction xor p3 it upper bounds the

360
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,519
advantage by this quantity

361
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,839
which is 20 into square root of u into q

362
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
max over 2 to the n when q max is upper

363
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,760
bounded by 2 to the n over 12.

364
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,079
so what this result implies is that

365
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,880
xor p 3 can be used simultaneously and

366
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
independently by order of 2 to the n

367
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
many users when the adversary is allowed

368
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,399
to make order of 2 to the n many queries

369
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
per user

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
in the single user setting

371
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,279
when we

372
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,880
plug in uh the value u equal to 1 it

373
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,320
shows that the adversary's advantage is

374
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
of the order 1 over 2 to the n

375
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
over 2

376
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
even after making order of 2 to the n

377
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
many queries

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
our second result is a single user prf

379
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
advantage of this

380
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
efficient version xorpedas tree and it

381
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
is upper bounded by this quantity

382
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,920
we haven't given multi-user analysis of

383
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
this construction but it can be done in

384
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,440
a manner similar to this one and

385
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
we would get similar type of bound as

386
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,040
that of

387
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,560
this construction x or v three

388
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,199
now to compare our first result uh with

389
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
the one obtained by wong and shin

390
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
recently for the construction xr p2

391
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,120
in their case the multi-user prf

392
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
advantage is

393
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
upper bounded by a quantity which is of

394
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
the order square root of n

395
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
into q over 2 to the n here q is the

396
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,519
total number of queries made by the

397
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,800
adversary

398
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
so

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,920
so our result is a substantial

400
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
improvement over this one also for this

401
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,650
efficient

402
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,279
[Music]

403
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,320
version

404
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
ah

405
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
the one obtained by kogiati for

406
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,279
xor p dash 2

407
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,600
in that case the multi user prf

408
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,079
advantage is upper bounded ah

409
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,360
by

410
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
quantity which is of the order q over 2

411
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
to the n so in this case also

412
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
we obtain

413
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,519
substantial improvement

414
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
so our results justify the title of our

415
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,199
work

416
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,040
and we have applied our result uh to

417
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
counter mode encryption

418
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,839
without going into technical details uh

419
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,759
i just stated that the multi-user

420
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,079
security of the construction

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,480
i mean counter mode encryption

422
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
uh is similar to that of xrp3 when

423
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
the encryption scheme is instantiated

424
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
with a good lock cipher

425
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,199
and

426
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,439
this can be compared with parity method

427
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
encryption ah

428
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
proposed by velary and others which

429
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
achieves similar level of security but

430
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,799
requires additional randomness

431
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,320
the main technique that we have employed

432
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
in our probes is the chi square method

433
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
it's a tool for bounding

434
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
bounding the statistical distance

435
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
between two joint distributions so in

436
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,799
order to describe it uh let x to the q

437
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
be this q tuple of random variables

438
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
sampled as per this distribution and z

439
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
to the q be this

440
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,120
q tuple of random variables sampled as

441
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,080
per this distribution both the tuples

442
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
takes

443
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
take their values over this domain now

444
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
we can define this conditional

445
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
conditional distributions so x i minus 1

446
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
is the

447
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,280
this x to the x to the i minus 1 is the

448
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
tuple

449
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
x 1 to x i minus 1. so these are fixed

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
values so so we have we have this

451
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
conditional distributions these two

452
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
conditional distributions now we can

453
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
define the chi-square distance and then

454
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
ah the chi square method states that

455
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
the statistical distance between these

456
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,919
two joint distributions is upper bounded

457
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,039
by this

458
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,240
quantity

459
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
now this is uh this is the expected chi

460
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
square distance where the expectation is

461
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
taken over

462
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,679
ah the random choice of

463
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,880
x 1 to x i minus 1 so

464
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
here

465
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
this

466
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
x

467
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
1 small x 1 2 small x i minus 1 these

468
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,090
are fixed values now we we

469
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,960
[Music]

470
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
make them random and and

471
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,799
and

472
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,520
sample them as per this distribution so

473
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,320
so then we we get this expected value of

474
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,360
this chi square distance this method was

475
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,720
introduced in the cryptography

476
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,919
literature by dai and others in 2017 and

477
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,400
since then it has been effectively used

478
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
in quite a few

479
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
recent works and

480
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
in this work also we have found this

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
method to be fairly effective in

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
bounding

483
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,960
the

484
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
statistical distance between joint

485
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,120
distributions

486
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
now i am going to discuss

487
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,039
the main steps

488
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,320
of

489
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
the proof of our first result that is

490
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,960
multi-user prf security of xrp3

491
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,679
so as we discussed earlier

492
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,360
ah the

493
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,080
advantage of adversary

494
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
is

495
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
upper bounded by the statistical

496
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480
difference between these two

497
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,080
distributions

498
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
so

499
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
the goal is to

500
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
upper bound this statistical distance

501
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
and there we want to apply

502
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
the chi square method

503
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
it turns out

504
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
that there is a certain issue around the

505
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,080
adversary's

506
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,039
choice

507
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,360
of the user of the i query which we

508
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,679
denote here by ui

509
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,039
adaptively

510
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,240
so ui can potentially depend

511
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
on

512
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,240
all the previous replies and

513
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
not only on the replies previous replies

514
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
given by ui

515
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
and that

516
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
creates a problem for application of the

517
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
chi square method so is there a way

518
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
around this problem

519
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,200
a possible solution lies in reordering

520
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
the transcripts so we tran so we

521
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,360
reordered the transcript p to a

522
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
transcript s and we reordered the

523
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
transcript r to a transcript u

524
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
we do it in such a way that

525
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,600
the replies given by the same user are

526
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,679
clubbed together so in the original

527
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,400
transcripts p and r that might not have

528
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
been the case

529
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
but in the in the reorder transcript or

530
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,919
the permuted transcripts

531
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,480
we ensure that this happens

532
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
and that somehow

533
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
ah

534
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,159
makes it possible for chi square method

535
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,200
to be applied on this

536
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
ah transcript

537
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
transcripts s and u

538
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
so how do how do we reorder transcripts

539
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,679
u

540
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,880
and s

541
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,840
can be thought of to be generated by

542
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,039
this two random experiments

543
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
now for transcript u

544
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
ah the q tuple

545
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,679
is is sampled

546
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
with replacement manner from the set g

547
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
which is nothing but this set

548
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
0 1 to the n

549
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
and for random experiment s

550
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,559
what we do is that for each user

551
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,919
we sample

552
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
3 into q max many elements

553
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,600
with in a without replacement manner

554
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,799
ah from the set 0 1 to the n

555
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
and then

556
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,159
we we

557
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
divide this 3 into q max many elements

558
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
into

559
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
q max many triples

560
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
then finally what we do is that for

561
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
each l in q

562
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,760
we

563
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
take

564
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,799
these triples one by one and take their

565
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
sum and generate

566
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
the corresponding element of the

567
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,640
q tuple

568
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
now it is not difficult to see that the

569
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,520
transcripts r and u are the same

570
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,760
both are q tables sampled with

571
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,120
replacement from the set 0 1 to the n

572
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,159
what we have achieved by reordering p2s

573
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,799
is that we have created a transcript

574
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
where the replies

575
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
from the same user

576
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
are grouped together

577
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
so

578
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,360
the first qmax

579
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,559
replies

580
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,760
belong to user 1 the second qmax replies

581
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
belong to user 2 and in this manner the

582
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,840
entire transcript is built

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
now we make two important observations

584
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,320
first one is that the distribution of

585
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
output is independent of input in both

586
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
words that is for the construction xor

587
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
p3 as well as for the random function

588
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
and second one is that the adversary

589
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,360
makes

590
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
same number of queries to each user

591
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
in fact the second one is an assumption

592
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
that we have made while defining the

593
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
notion of multi-user security so what

594
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
these two facts allows us is

595
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,679
first

596
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
it makes it possible to reorder the

597
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,960
transcripts

598
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,039
secondly now

599
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,640
in in

600
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
the transcript s the user for the ith

601
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,559
query denoted by ui is uniquely

602
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,320
determined by the index i so ui equal to

603
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,679
that unit j such that i equal to j minus

604
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,440
1 into q max

605
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,039
plus

606
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,480
k where k is between 1 to q max

607
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
so in particular we have that this

608
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
conditional probability is exactly equal

609
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,559
to this conditional probability so if

610
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
the user for the ith query is j then

611
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,120
probability s i given all the previous

612
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,520
replies by all the users is exactly

613
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,799
equal to the conditional probability

614
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,159
of s i

615
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,520
given the

616
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,840
previous replies by user j only

617
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
this follows because the random

618
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,559
permutation sampled by user j for the

619
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
construction x or p

620
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,799
is independent of

621
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,880
all the other random permutations ah

622
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
sampled by the other users

623
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
now this makes it possible to apply the

624
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
chi square method to

625
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
bound the statistical distance between

626
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
the distributions corresponding to

627
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
transcript s and transcript u

628
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,360
another important thing to notice is

629
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
that the statistical distance between

630
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,919
the original distributions

631
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,840
is exactly equal to the statistical

632
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
distance between

633
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
the distributions corresponding to the

634
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,600
reorder transcripts this is because

635
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
reordering being a permutation preserves

636
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,480
the statistical distance

637
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
so now it is enough to upper bound the

638
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,880
statistical distance corresponding to

639
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,240
the reordered transcripts

640
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,080
ah now can we apply chi square method

641
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,279
to

642
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,840
for for these two distributions here we

643
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
need to ensure that support of s is

644
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,159
contained in support of u that is that

645
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
is one of the conditions that has to be

646
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
made in order to apply the chi square

647
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,200
method how do we ensure that we ensure

648
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
that by extending the transcripts s and

649
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,400
u to the transcripts x and y

650
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,320
respectively

651
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,000
so here s and u becomes marginals of x

652
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,880
and y

653
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,279
how do we extend this

654
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
for each

655
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,000
i in q we make x i equal to this triple

656
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
t i 1 t i 2 s i where s i

657
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,080
as we have

658
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,039
made it

659
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,919
is exactly equal to t i 1 plus t i 2

660
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
plus t i 3

661
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,679
and y i equal to v i 1 v i 2 u

662
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
now due to this extension this

663
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
collection of v i's corresponding to

664
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,279
each user ah

665
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,720
behave like a w or sample

666
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,840
this v i

667
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,559
for each user this collection of v i's

668
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,200
kind of simulate ah the collection of t

669
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,159
i's

670
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,240
so if you remember the random experiment

671
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,760
for s this tis are sampled without

672
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
replacement

673
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,880
ah from the set 0 1 to the n

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
now here it should be noted that v i 3

675
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
is given by this expression

676
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,600
so k takes

677
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,559
the value from the set 1 to 3

678
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,279
and v i 3 is given by v i 1 plus v i 2

679
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,200
plus u i

680
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
now the question is what are v i 1 and v

681
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,399
i 2 we haven't defined them so far

682
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,360
in order to see what v i 1 v i 2 are let

683
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
i be given by this expression so ith

684
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,120
query is the jth user's kth query

685
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
so the

686
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
user for the 8th query is j

687
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,240
and we consider the set of all tuples v1

688
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
v2

689
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,360
such that v 1 v 2

690
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,159
and

691
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,640
u i plus v 1 plus v 2 belong to this set

692
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,320
so g is g is the set 0 1 to the n

693
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
and we are discarding all the v i's

694
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
that belong to

695
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,120
the jth user

696
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,240
so

697
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
so far so far

698
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
for jth users there has been k minus 1

699
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
queries

700
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,880
because this query is the jth user's kth

701
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,640
query so this vis correspond correspond

702
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,799
to

703
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,760
those k minus 1 queries so we are

704
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,720
discarding those v i's and we also

705
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,960
require that ui plus v1 plus 2 and v 1

706
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,799
and v 2 they

707
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,918
they remain distinct

708
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,840
now

709
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
v i 1 v i 2

710
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,678
is sampled from this set

711
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,600
so after extension

712
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,720
it can be shown that support of x

713
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,679
is exactly equal to support of y so

714
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,080
that makes it possible to apply the

715
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,159
chi-square method

716
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,520
to bound

717
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
the statistical distance between these

718
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,200
two distributions

719
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,760
and also since s and u are marginals of

720
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,039
x and y then we have this relation

721
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,520
the statistical distance between ah the

722
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000
distributions corresponding to these two

723
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,559
transcripts s and u is

724
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
upper bounded by

725
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,000
the statistical distance between the

726
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,559
distributions corresponding to the

727
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,760
extended

728
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,120
transcripts x and y

729
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,559
ah then we are now we are in a position

730
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,960
to apply the chi square method

731
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,000
to bound

732
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,559
uh this statistical distance now we come

733
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,480
to calculating this conditional

734
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
probabilities under the distributions p

735
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,120
r x and p r y

736
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,159
uh

737
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,360
so here x i is this triple

738
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,600
ah so this part is slightly technical

739
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
but what i want to highlight is that

740
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,120
this conditional probability which

741
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
which is conditioned on the entire

742
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,159
previous history

743
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,720
and takes into account the replies from

744
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,240
all the users

745
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,399
can be reduced to

746
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,559
this conditional probability where the

747
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,600
history is limited to only the jth user

748
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,200
now this is possible due to reordering

749
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,760
ah and we have discussed uh this

750
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,600
reduction while

751
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,240
while we discuss the reordering of the

752
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
transcripts now due to this

753
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
due to this reduction it is possible ah

754
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,760
to calculate this conditional

755
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
probability

756
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,279
and

757
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,880
which is given by this expression

758
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,679
this 3 under bar

759
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,399
stands for following factorial

760
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,000
similarly we can calculate this

761
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
conditional probability under this

762
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,039
distribution

763
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,640
and it turns out to be

764
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
this quantity here this set is the same

765
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
set eta i that we have

766
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,919
discussed in the previous slide after

767
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,440
the conditional probabilities or the

768
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
distributions have been calculated

769
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,960
then we can

770
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,120
ah calculate the chi square distance

771
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
between between the ah two conditional

772
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
distributions and this turns out to be

773
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,039
this expression where c and d are given

774
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,919
by these two

775
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,799
expressions and

776
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,679
then

777
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,480
we

778
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,600
calculate

779
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,159
the expected value of this chi square

780
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,240
distance where the expectation is

781
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,279
computed under the distribution p r x

782
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,440
and it turns out to be this expression

783
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,880
so our final task is to compute

784
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,399
this ex

785
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,799
expectation

786
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,200
now the task of

787
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,000
computing the expectation is taken care

788
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,480
of by an important lemma

789
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,279
which we termed core lemma in our paper

790
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,720
ah in order to discuss the lemma

791
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,000
let us denote f2 to the n by g so

792
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
cardinality of g is denoted by capital n

793
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,440
and let v r be a random r set in g

794
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,640
then for each element u in g we define

795
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,720
the set of tuples

796
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,519
where u

797
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,960
plus g one plus g two this belongs to

798
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,720
the random ah

799
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
r set

800
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
and we also required that u g one g two

801
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
be distinct

802
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,480
now this set

803
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,840
is is is the same set that we discussed

804
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,360
while discussing the conditional

805
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,760
probability taken under ah

806
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,640
the distribution p r y

807
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,600
and let us denote so its size is a

808
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
random variable since v r is a random

809
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,399
set

810
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,960
random r set so the size of this set is

811
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,760
a random variable which we denote by

812
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,440
capital n u r

813
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
now

814
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,080
so the task of compute computing the

815
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
expectation in the last slide boils down

816
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
to computing this expectation

817
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
now the first step towards computing

818
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,000
this expectation is to compute the

819
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,480
expectation of this random variable n e

820
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,440
r

821
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,960
that we are complete

822
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,919
using

823
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,640
ah indicator random variables

824
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,919
so

825
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
for for the element u we define this set

826
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,519
to be the set of all tuples g 1 g 2 such

827
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
that they are not equal and both belong

828
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
to this set g minus u

829
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,559
and then we define this indicator random

830
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,039
variable

831
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,320
corresponding to each such tuple

832
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,279
where its value is one if g one g two

833
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,679
and u plus g one plus g two

834
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,519
all these ah three belong to the set vr

835
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,120
and we also required that

836
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
all of them are distinct so g 1 g and g

837
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
2 are already distinct and u is u is

838
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,159
also distinct from g 1 and g 2

839
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,799
and its value is 0 if if this condition

840
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,320
is not met

841
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
then this random variable can be

842
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
expressed as the sum of these indicator

843
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,760
random variables

844
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,800
and then we can exploit

845
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
the linearity of expectation to compute

846
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,879
this expectation in a straightforward

847
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
manner and it turns out to be

848
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,719
the expected

849
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,719
this expectation turns out to be exactly

850
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,320
equal to d

851
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,520
ah

852
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,960
this is this d

853
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
and

854
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,480
then we have this

855
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
then then this expectation actually

856
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,399
turns out to be variance of this random

857
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,399
variable so

858
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,639
computing this expectation is is to

859
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,800
compute this variance now the question

860
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,599
is how do we compute this variance

861
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,839
so to do that

862
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,079
for each tuple g1 g2 we define this set

863
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,520
as du

864
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,280
where g1 g2 and u plus g1 plus

865
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,359
g2 i mean this triple

866
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,320
consists of this elements g1 g2 and u

867
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
plus g1 plus g 2

868
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,680
then we observe that cardinality of

869
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,640
union of two such sets

870
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,320
corresponding to two

871
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,640
tuples g and z dash which

872
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
may not be distinct

873
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,280
can take

874
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,839
three distinct values 3 5 and 6 which we

875
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,839
denote by w

876
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,920
now we come to computation of this

877
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
variance so where we employ

878
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,960
the variance covariance formula for the

879
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
variance part we employ this formula

880
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,800
since i g is an indicator random

881
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,359
variable we employ this formula and get

882
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
this expression for the covariance part

883
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,160
we employ this formula and we split the

884
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,240
sum according to the value of w for w

885
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,880
equal to 3 we get this expression when w

886
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,119
takes value in the set 5 6 we get this

887
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,240
expression

888
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,440
and from these three expressions we get

889
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
the

890
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
we can compute the value of this

891
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,200
variance

892
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
which is given by this expression

893
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,079
and once this variance is computed we

894
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,000
can compute

895
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
the expectation of this chi square

896
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
distance

897
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,359
ah between two distributions which is

898
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,599
given by this expression

899
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,520
and this finally

900
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
leads to

901
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,839
the upper bound on the statistical

902
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,079
distance between these two distributions

903
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,400
this is what we

904
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
set out to

905
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,640
do

906
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
and this is the result that we get

907
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,599
to conclude

908
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
in this work we have shown strong prf

909
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,960
security of the construction xrp3

910
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
in the multi-user setting our result

911
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
implies that

912
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,680
xrp3 can be used simultaneously and

913
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
independently by order of two to the n

914
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
many users while the adversary can make

915
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,079
order of two to the end many queries per

916
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,960
user in the single user setting we have

917
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
shown that the the adverse series

918
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
advantage is limited to

919
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
is negligible

920
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,280
precisely of the order

921
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
1 over 2 to the n over 2 even after

922
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,960
making order of 2 to the n mini queries

923
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,160
for the efficient version x or p dash 3

924
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
we have shown similar security

925
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,040
guarantees we have given the proof only

926
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,800
for the single user case

927
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
and the multi-user security analysis can

928
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,920
be carried out in the same manner

929
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
as was done for

930
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,680
the construction xor p3
