00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,080
hi and welcome to the presentation of

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,880
the paper cryptographic analysis of the

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
bluetooth secure connection protocol

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,240
suite

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
my name is olga sanina and this is a

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
joint work with mark fishland from

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,439
darmstadt technical university

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,199
if you are watching it using bluetooth

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,400
devices

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,320
these might be right video for you

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
you probably heard about bluetooth low

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
energy in the light of contact tracing

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
but this is one of the mods in bluetooth

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
bluetooth technology comes in two

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,719
different variants

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,920
classic

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
and low energy

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
bluetooth classic is used for

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,239
connections with continuous data streams

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,000
like headphones controllers cars

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,480
in contrast bluetooth low energy is

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,280
typically used when power consumption is

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
a concern and data is transferred

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
periodically for example in fitness

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,239
trackers smart homes pacemakers

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
there are also devices that support both

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
variants of bluetooth like smartphones

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
in this presentation i will focus on

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
bluetooth's low energy

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,520
to encrypt the data between two devices

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
the first need to establish a key

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,159
in bluetooth there is a bunch of

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,240
protocols for key exchange with

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,560
different levels of security

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
and the strongest one is called cq

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,200
connection

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
now you might ask me why do we need yet

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,320
another analysis

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
bluetooth protocol is out there for such

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
a long time wasn't it analyzed already

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
well there were indeed some papers with

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
analysis of key exchange in bluetooth

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
however they had some drawbacks

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
first they always considered only

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
standalone protocols and proved them to

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
be secure

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
second they modeled the protocol not

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
close to the standard

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
for example the analysis assumed that a

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,959
fresh dv helmet share is used in each

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
connection

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
however the standard allows to use the

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,840
same difficult share in up to eight

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
connections

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
this also caused a problem in lindel's

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
analysis where the session identifiers

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
were defined via only these divi helmet

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
shares

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
and strictly speaking the result in the

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
paper cannot even guarantee a

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,080
correctness property for the protocol

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
another thing is that lindell and soon

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
in their papers assumed that the entire

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
divi helmet curve point enters the

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
computation

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
while the standard uses only

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
x-coordinate of the divi helmet off

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,920
point

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
trancosa and hale in their paper pointed

70
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
that out and correctly used only the

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
x-coordinate

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,760
okay but why is it important to analyze

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
the entire protocol speed

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,239
why can't we just take the most secure

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
protocol in the speed and use it

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
for all the devices

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
well devices have different features

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
such as input and output capabilities

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,239
hence we cannot rule out some protocols

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,959
because all of them are used

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
in addition there is a range of various

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
monster-in-the-middle attacks on

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
protocols

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
starting from reflection and troll

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
confusion attacks

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
up to downgrade attacks on the

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
encryption key size

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
and the attacks on the authentication

89
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
property where the adjuster can even

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
learn the encryption key

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
one of such attacks is presented in the

92
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,920
paper by zanetal from the useless last

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,599
year

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
imagine we have a user who wants to

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
connect their keyboard

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
to the screen

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
for this the screen will display some

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
digits which user must type on the

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,680
keyboard

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
looks good right

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
but there is a monster in the metal

102
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,959
attack going on at the same time

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,599
for this the adjustory connects its fake

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,798
screen to the keyboard of the user

105
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,358
when the user inserts the digits the

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,160
adjuster learns them

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
then the adjuster enters these digits on

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120
the fake keyboard and successfully

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,759
connect to the user screen and establish

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,199
the session key with the user

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
now with all this in mind we can move to

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,840
the contribution of the

113
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
paper we give the first analysis of the

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,160
entire cq connection protocol suite

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
because of all this monster in the

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
middle attacks we could not show

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
bluetooth protocol to be in

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
authenticated key exchange

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,440
so we analyze the suit as trust on the

120
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
first use key exchange

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
then we also investigate a privacy

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,840
mechanism available in bluetooth low

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
energy and the small bonus we also give

124
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,160
a precise and exhaustive description of

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
the bluetooth key exchange protocol

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
suite

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
first i will present you the security

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
results

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
but before jumping to them i will

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
briefly show their protocol form

131
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
bluetooth key exchange consists of the

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
initial connection where the devices

133
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
connect for the first time and establish

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
a bond and a reconnection when the

135
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
boundary devices want to communicate

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
with each other again

137
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
for the initial connection the devices

138
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,400
start with connecting on the physical

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
level

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
where both send their device addresses

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,479
for identification

142
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,800
after that the devices need to connect

143
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
on the logical level

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
where they exchange their device

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
specific information such as input and

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
output capabilities of the devices

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,039
finally they can start their parent

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
process where they first performed the

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,759
elite curve divi helmet key exchange to

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,759
send each other the diffie-hellman

151
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,800
shares

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
then they exchanged some random nonsense

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
and then they set a key confirmation to

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
check the derived shared key

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
for the reconnections tab the devices

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
again need to connect on the physical

157
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,440
level if they are not connected yet

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
then they can go directly to the session

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
key establishment and derive a session

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
key from the shared secret

161
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
which they established during the

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
initial connection

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
this encryption key will be then used to

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
encrypt the communication between the

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
devices

166
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
now how does the trust on first use

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
model work in this case

168
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
during the initial connection the

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,199
adjuster stays passive and can only if

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,960
drop the communication between two

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
devices

172
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
when the devices are reconnected the

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
adjuster can be active and affect the

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
communication by modifying the messages

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,039
dropping them revealing the encryption

176
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,639
keys and so on

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,400
now i will show you the model that we

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
used to analyze the key exchange in

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
bluetooth

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,680
we used a game-based security model in

181
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,840
belarus style we aimed for two security

182
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
properties first property is key secrecy

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
which intuitively means that the

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
encryption key remains secret

185
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
so when we give the adjuster the real

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
key and some random string

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
the adjuster cannot efficiently

188
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,119
distinguish between them

189
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
the second

190
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,599
property is smash security which

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
consists of the two conditions

192
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,120
first the sessions that are partnered

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
must arrive the same session key

194
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
second

195
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
not more than two sessions must be

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
partnered

197
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
to capture the adversarial behavior we

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,318
give him the access to the oracle

199
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
the test oracle is used for key secrecy

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
and the reveal oracle allows the editor

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
to learn the session key

202
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
send lets the addresses to send any

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
messages to the arbitrary sessions

204
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
e-need session and trick connect oracles

205
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
are used to establish a session with the

206
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
initial connection or with the

207
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,919
reconnection if the devices have been

208
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
bounded before

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
finally we allow the adversary to choose

210
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
when the devices change their divi helm

211
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
and share with the next bk oracle

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
before presenting the results i will

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
show you the assumptions that we used

214
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
to achieve this results

215
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,839
first we used prf or dh assumption from

216
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,680
the paper by brenda little from crypto

217
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,640
2017

218
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,600
then we also assumed that is used for

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
session key derivation is a pseudorandom

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
function

221
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
we also assumed trust on first use so

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,279
the adversary stays passive during the

223
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
initial connection and becomes active

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
during the reconnection of two devices

225
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,800
we showed that under these assumptions

226
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
the secure connection protocol suite is

227
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
a secure trust and first use key

228
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
exchange

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
you can check

230
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
the bounds and details of the proof in

231
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,959
the paper

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
now we can go to another part of the

233
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,319
contribution which is privacy analysis

234
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
pure that most of the analysis looked

235
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
into privacy as linkability of the

236
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,040
physical characteristics of the devices

237
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
such as

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
the strength of the signal

239
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
there is a paper by sunital in censored

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
journal which studied the linkability of

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
the cryptographic transcript in

242
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,719
bluetooth key exchange protocol

243
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
they pointed out correctly that the

244
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
devices can be easily linked if they use

245
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,839
the same divi helm and share in several

246
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
connections

247
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
however they only focused on secure

248
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
connection and did not give any analysis

249
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,360
of the address randomization mechanism

250
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
which is essential for the key exchange

251
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,240
and done before the devices enter the cq

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
connection stage

253
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
the privacy mechanism in bluetooth

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,519
allows the devices to use non-resolvable

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
or resolvable random addresses instead

256
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,079
of their physical mac addresses

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
non-resolvable addresses are just random

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
values that are generated new every

259
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
certain period of time

260
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
it doesn't contain any information about

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,160
the device and that is why it can be

262
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
used only in initial connections

263
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120
opposite the resolvable addresses

264
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
consist of some random value prompt

265
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,519
which is then concatenated to the

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
ciphertext

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
this cipher text is derived from the

268
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
prompt encrypted with the identity

269
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
resolver key

270
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
to resolve the address this identity

271
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,959
resultant key must be distributed to the

272
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,160
device

273
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,399
therefore this type of addresses can be

274
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,240
used only in reconnections

275
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,279
the identity resolvent key is unique for

276
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,680
the device and the same key is

277
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
distributed among all the devices with

278
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,079
which the initial device is bounding

279
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
but if there is an adversary among these

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
devices

281
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
then the identity resolving key is

282
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,000
compromised for all of the connections

283
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
we also used a game based model for the

284
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,639
analysis of privacy

285
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,720
here we aimed for the property which we

286
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
called outsider privacy

287
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
intuitively it means that the adjustory

288
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
cannot link the target device

289
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
that is he cannot distinguish the target

290
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
device from some other identical device

291
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
second it also means that the identity

292
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,839
resolving key of the target remains

293
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,920
secret we make the address repassive and

294
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
model his behavior by giving him the

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
access only to the test oracle

296
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
this oracle gives back the transcript

297
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
between a device and either the target

298
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,560
or some other device

299
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
now let's look into the results that we

300
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,519
received

301
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
i will again start with the assumptions

302
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
that we used

303
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
as i mentioned before

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
we assume the adjuster is passive and

305
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
cannot learn the identity resolving key

306
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
of the target device

307
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,120
then we assume that tv helmet sharers

308
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
are new in each session

309
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
otherwise the device can be easily

310
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,760
linked what was shown in the paper by

311
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
sunital

312
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
next we assume that the target device

313
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
uses the same device specific

314
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
information as the devices

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
from which the adjuster is trying to

316
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,680
distinguish the target

317
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,639
finally we assume that ies which is used

318
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
to encrypt the random

319
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,040
value prompt is a pseudorandom function

320
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,920
we proved that the address randomization

321
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,399
mechanism achieves outside the privacy

322
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,639
under the assumptions that are mentioned

323
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,440
with a decent level

324
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
that is the bound does not achieve the

325
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,240
cryptographic standard of 2 to the power

326
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,000
of -60

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
but the mechanism is sound due to the

328
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,399
difficulty to mount the attacks with the

329
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,320
big number of the devices

330
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
note that this result does not rule out

331
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
the linkability of the devices based on

332
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
their physical characteristics

333
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
such as the time with which the new

334
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
address is generated

335
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,040
or the strength on the signal

336
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
let's wrap up the talk

337
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,920
we showed that the secure connection

338
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,880
protocol speed provides basic

339
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
common key requirements in trust and

340
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,440
first use model under reasonable

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
assumptions

342
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
we showed that bluetooth low energy

343
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
achieves outside the privacy when we

344
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,279
rule out physical traceability

345
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
we also found out and i would like to

346
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,079
mention that that the bluetooth standard

347
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
called core specification is extremely

348
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,279
hard to navigate through it has a huge

349
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
size of 3000 pages and lack of clarity

350
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
in terminology

351
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
for example when it comes to the desired

352
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
security properties the standard is

353
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,639
rather vague

354
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
because the requirements are not

355
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,040
specified or subsumed under imprecise

356
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
terms

357
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,920
this concludes my presentation

358
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
thank you for watching if you have any

359
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
questions feel free to contact me by

360
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,639
email

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
bye
