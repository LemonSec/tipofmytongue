00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,319
hello everyone

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,200
the title of this talk is algebraic

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,920
attacks on astar and duster using low

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
degree equations this is a joint work

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,200
with stanton soccer willie mayer

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,119
recently there is a trend to design

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,600
symmetric key primitives friendly to

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
applications like secure multi-party

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
computation fully homomorphic encryption

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
and zero knowledge proof systems our

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
star is a fully homomorphic encryption

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,640
friendly design proposed at crypto 2018

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
the overall structure is depicted in

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
this figure specifically for our runs as

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,600
our star it will iterate a run function

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
composed of a fine layer and a

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,719
non-linear layer for outcomes then

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
one more affine layer is applied to the

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
output finally the key is xor with the

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,879
output and the key stream z is generated

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
a notable feature of r star is that the

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
the file layers are ever changing for

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
each to be encrypted plaintext block

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
in other words each key stream z is

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
generated with a different concrete r

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
star instance

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
this is quite different from the common

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
symmetric key cryptographic designs

29
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,200
where the

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
linear layers

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
non-linear layers and run constants are

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
all fixed

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,079
let me give a brief introduction of the

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
after run function

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,799
the file layer is

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,119
is generated in this way first

37
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,720
use the plain text blocks use the blend

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
test block counter c and the nouns in as

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,920
the input to an x or f for example check

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
2 file 6.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,200
second

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
use the output of the x or f to

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,038
construct a random fur rank linear

44
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,840
matrix m of size

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
n times n and a random n bit run

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
constant are c for each round

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
then the matrix m and the run constant

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
rc will form the affine layer a

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,120
different from the

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,000
fine layer the nonlinear layer of r star

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is fixed and it is indeed the m bit chi

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
operation

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
note that

54
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
the file bit co-operation is used in the

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
ketchup run function

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
the designers recommended a set of

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
parameters for the block size in the

58
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,800
security level copper and the number of

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
rounds are indeed the choice of these

60
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
parameters is based on the resistance

61
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,519
against the linearization attack which

62
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
will be detailed later in addition i

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,360
have to emphasize that the key size is

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
the same with the block size

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,720
therefore according to this table it can

66
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,280
be found that the key size is much

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
larger than the claimed security level

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
copper for example we can focus on the

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
first the first

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
firster row of this table the key size

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,319
is

72
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,440
327 while the designers only claim

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
80-bit security

74
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,360
moreover

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
it should be noticed that there is a

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,640
limit on the number of plaintext blocks

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,840
for each n-bit

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,560
key apart from the above parameters the

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
designers also propose the three

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
aggressive parameters

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,799
where

82
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
uh the security level copper is almost

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
the same with the keysight in

84
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,879
they are called hr star

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,400
the same uh

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
the same data limit also holds for hr

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
star and there is no attack can break

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,000
any of them

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
with such a data limit

90
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,800
as for duster it can be viewed as a

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
variant of after in a world different

92
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
from our star using our changing linear

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
layers

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
dashboard adopts a deterministic

95
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,639
lens flow rank linear transfer matrix

96
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
error the dashboard primitive was

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
proposed at a 262020

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
the overall structure of asta and the

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
duster are the same

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
as depth

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
as shown in this figure so they all both

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
of them use

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,120
the feed forward operation

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
the non-linear layer of dust is the same

105
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
with the asta

106
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,600
so

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
both of them use the n-bit calibration

108
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
however the linear layer is redesigned

109
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
in duster

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
specifically the linear layer

111
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
is now composed of a fixed linear

112
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
transform air and an error changing bit

113
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
permutation p

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
the

115
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,479
so the bit permutation p will depend on

116
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
the rounded number and the plaintext

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
block counter c

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
so our attack is irrelevant to the

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
uh details of the permutation

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,039
p

121
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,720
so i i mean so our text can work for any

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
bit permutations i will not

123
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
detail the specification of p

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,320
there are two main features of duster

125
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
first

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
no pseudo random number generator is

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
used second there is no need to generate

128
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
random full rank matrices

129
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
the dashboard designers propose the same

130
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
parameters as after

131
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
except the one whose block size is too

132
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
large as listed in this table

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
so the the the

134
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,600
they also use the uh so dasta also use

135
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,280
the same data limit as rsr

136
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,880
now i'll describe the analysis of our

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
star note that the same analysis also

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
applies to us duster because they are in

139
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
general the same design

140
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
the most challenging problems to analyze

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,759
after are listed here first it is a

142
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
moving target second traditional

143
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,360
techniques like differential linear cube

144
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,840
and high order differential attacks or

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,319
fail because they're required to collect

146
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
many plaintext cypher test pairs and a

147
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,720
fixed encryption instance however this

148
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
is not the case for our star because

149
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
each key stream d is generated with a

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
different

151
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
concrete instance

152
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,160
however there are also some notable

153
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
exploitable features

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
first the degree of the non-linear

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,759
operation the calibration is 2.

156
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
so the degree of the round function is

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
low second the number of grounds is

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
small

159
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
at the last there is a feed forward

160
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
operation which implies that

161
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,680
a mid in the middle style attack may

162
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
work

163
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
all in all the algebraic attack seems

164
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,800
potential for the low degree of the uh

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,879
for the low degree of the run function

166
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,919
and

167
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,240
the small number of runs

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,039
their designers are obviously aware of

169
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,759
it

170
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,960
indeed the true see the the choices of

171
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
the parameters are based on the

172
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
resistance against the linearization

173
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,440
attack

174
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
there's no doubt that the linearization

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,440
attack is the simplest algebraic attack

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
the procedure is very simple first the

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
attacker collects t equations in terms

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
of m variables and the degree of these

179
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,520
equations

180
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
is up bounded by t

181
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,800
then

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
if the number of equations is larger

183
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
than the total number of different terms

184
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
formed by the m variables

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
he can rename all the terms of degree

186
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
larger than one with new variables

187
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,479
finally the problem is equivalent to

188
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,039
solving a system of linear equations

189
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
where the number of equations is larger

190
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,480
than the number of unknowns which can be

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
easily solved by gaussian elimination

192
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
obviously the degree d

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
will dominate the time complexity of the

194
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
linearization attack

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,839
a smaller d the lower the time

196
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
complexity of the gaussian elimination

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,640
and the attack

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
let us

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
see how the designers evaluated the

200
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
resistance against the linearization

201
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
attack as the degree of the calibration

202
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
is two in the forward direction for

203
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,560
irons of after the degree of the key

204
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
stream z in terms of the key bits is

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
upper bounded by two to the r hence the

206
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,480
attacker will need to solve a system of

207
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
nonlinear equations in terms of n

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
unknowns and of degree upper bounded by

209
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
2 to the r as already said the degree

210
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
will have a big influence on the time

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
complexity of the attack thus it is

212
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
natural to ask whether it is possible to

213
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
lower the degree to 2dr by using a meet

214
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,640
in the middle style structure

215
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
however

216
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,839
is it really possible is it really

217
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,839
feasible to consider the back deduction

218
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
to the feed forward direction it is easy

219
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
to observe that

220
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
the output of the

221
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,760
last car operation can be written as

222
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
linear expressions in terms of the

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,880
qubits

224
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,680
in other words the degree of the output

225
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
can be

226
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,240
treated as one in addition the input of

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
the last cooperation is

228
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
of degree of bounded but bounded by 2 to

229
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
the r minus 1.

230
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
although the degree of the output of the

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
last operation is 1 the degree of the

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
inverse of the largest scale cooperation

233
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,800
is rather high so it is a well-known

234
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,959
fact hence if we simply consider its

235
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,800
inverse

236
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,279
the degree of equations will be much

237
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
higher than 2 to the r and we can

238
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
benefit nothing from

239
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,600
such

240
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
a kind of equations

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
the time complexity of the attack will

242
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
only increase not decrease

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
indeed this

244
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
this is exactly what the designers

245
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,640
thought

246
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,920
and hence they gave up uh they directly

247
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
gave up such a mid in the middle style

248
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
attack

249
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
it is too costly to consider the inverse

250
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,760
of the calibration this is a summary of

251
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,000
what i explained just now

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
the analysis indicates that we should

253
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
never consider the full inverse of the

254
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
cooperation then how should we

255
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,200
how should we analyze our star

256
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
it can be found from our tape paper that

257
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,440
our used method is surprisingly simple

258
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
so i think it is more helpful to explain

259
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,279
how we find the simple improved linear

260
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
ratio attacks

261
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
we are inspired by the study on the

262
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
three bit low mcx box which is defined

263
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
below

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,600
so the degree is also two

265
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
then the authors of that paper described

266
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
how to generate more linearly

267
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,279
independent quadratic equations for

268
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
these three big s box

269
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
the idea

270
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
has already been none

271
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,279
uh and the real

272
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
has already been none and used in the we

273
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
are not xo algorithm

274
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
specifically

275
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,440
for the output bit by zero we can

276
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
multiply x 1 and x 2 with both sides of

277
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
the equation and we will again get two

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,120
different quadratic equations because

279
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
the only quadratic term in the

280
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
expression of y 0

281
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
is x y x 2

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
similar strategies can also be applied

283
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,800
to

284
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
uh

285
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
can also be applied to the output bit y1

286
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
and y2 moreover we have two additional

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
quadratic equations generated with

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
different ideas

289
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
thus we consider to eliminate the cubic

290
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,959
term

291
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,959
x0 x1 x2 as shown in the last two

292
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
equations in this slide so to do so we

293
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
have to consider two different output

294
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
bits so

295
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
combined with the inverse of the

296
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
three bit xbox there are in totally they

297
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,959
are in total

298
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
40 linearly independent quadratic

299
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,079
equations to describe the low mcs box

300
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
based on similar procedure we first

301
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,720
write we first list the n-codec boolean

302
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,079
equations for the n-bit calibration

303
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,199
then we can simply derive some quadratic

304
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,560
equations by multiplying proper prop by

305
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,839
multiplying

306
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
proper variables with both sides as

307
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,000
shown in the last two as shown

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
in the last two equations in this slide

309
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,959
then we ask ourselves whether there are

310
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,440
other ways to generate quadratic

311
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
equations in in other forms

312
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,680
this is a natural question because

313
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,040
we can uh have two additional quadratic

314
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,000
equations generated in different ways

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
for the long c emc xbox so

316
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
whether this als

317
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,639
so rather this also

318
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,839
uh

319
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,720
so

320
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
rather we can do the same for

321
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
the calibration

322
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
uh is worth investigating

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
then

324
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
we observe that we can consider two

325
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
consecutive output bits of the

326
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,760
cooperation this is also inspired by the

327
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
way to generate the two additional

328
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,639
quality equations for the

329
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,720
low mcs box so

330
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
uh that's

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
we we have to consider two different

332
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
output bits

333
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
by looking into two consecutive output

334
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,399
bits of the cooperation we find a

335
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,720
quartic equation in a quad different

336
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,680
form

337
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
that's y i plus

338
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
x i

339
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
and y i plus 1 equals to 0.

340
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
specifically different from the

341
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,959
quadratic equations

342
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,920
uh

343
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
in this slide so the last two equations

344
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
in this slide

345
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
the input bits of the corporation

346
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,320
will no more multiply with each other

347
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
what does this equation imply

348
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
first

349
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
we should note that x i is the input bit

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,880
of the calculation y i is the output bit

351
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
of the calculation second we should also

352
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,519
note that

353
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,279
the expression of x i is of degree

354
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
2 to the r minus 1 while the

355
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,639
degree of the

356
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,040
expression is 1.

357
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
hence

358
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
although the

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
largest scale calibration is not fully

360
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,399
inverted

361
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,759
we can obtain an equation in terms of

362
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,880
the cubits whose degree is upper bounded

363
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,560
by 2 to the r minus 1 plus 1

364
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
which is smaller than 2 to the r and the

365
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,160
degree of the inverse of the chi

366
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,880
operation

367
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
by simply using the above quadric

368
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,720
equation we can greatly reduce the

369
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,000
degree of the equations used for the

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
linearization attack on r star as

371
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,759
illustrated in this figure specifically

372
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
the degree is reduced from

373
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
2 to the r to

374
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,599
2 to the r minus 1 plus 1.

375
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
note that

376
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
we do not fully inverse the

377
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,240
calibration instead we only

378
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
carefully investigate the relations

379
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
between certain input bits and output

380
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,079
bits so that's why we use

381
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,399
a dashed line in this figure

382
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
so

383
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
for so when r is large

384
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
we can see that this is a great

385
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
reduction in the algebra degree

386
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,360
for example when r equals to

387
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
6

388
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
the degree of the equations is reduced

389
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
from 342

390
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
so uh

391
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
is reduced the degree of the equation is

392
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
reduced

393
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,840
from

394
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
64 to

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
33.

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
this equation also implies that the

397
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,160
linearization attack will be improved by

398
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
one more round

399
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
because attacking around after with the

400
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
new caustic equation is now equivalent

401
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
to attacking r minus 1

402
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,679
or star with the trivial linear ratio

403
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,640
attack

404
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
that's solving

405
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
a system of nonlinear equations of

406
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,679
degree

407
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
2 to the i minus 1 plus 1 in terms of n

408
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
variables

409
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,520
then

410
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,840
another question natural

411
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,559
arises

412
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
can we find other similar useful

413
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
equations if so how to find them to

414
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
answer this question we should first

415
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
understand what kind of equations

416
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
are useful to improve the attack to do

417
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,600
so

418
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,439
we first make a definition

419
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,840
for the exploitable equation

420
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,520
an equation is defined as uh

421
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
the exploitable

422
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,919
equation is defined as an equation where

423
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
the input bits of the chi operation

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,160
are only allowed to form linear terms or

425
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,280
quadratic terms with the output bits

426
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
finding exploitable equations is indeed

427
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
not that difficult because we already

428
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,400
know the constraint on their form

429
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
we can use a three step method first we

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
consider

431
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
a small scale calculation for example

432
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
in

433
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,760
a 7 9

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
11

435
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
or and 13 then we use a similar

436
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,960
technique to find quality equations for

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
xbox to find exploitable equations for

438
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
the small small scale cooperation

439
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
finally

440
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
we check

441
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,320
whether the found

442
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,880
exploitable equations also hold for the

443
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,039
calibration of any size

444
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,799
the five exploitable equations used in

445
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,120
this paper are listed here note that

446
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,919
equation 1 has has already been widely

447
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,080
used in the pre-media attack on catch

448
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,280
arc however it is always interpreted in

449
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,720
a different way in that context

450
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
in other words uh so

451
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,159
so the

452
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,440
its form does not attract too much

453
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
attention

454
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,280
as for that star we find that the attack

455
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,600
can be further optimized due to the

456
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,400
usage of a deterministic linear layer

457
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,280
air

458
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
in a world we can only

459
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
by only guessing one output bit of the

460
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
inverse of the last linear transform

461
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,440
error based on equation two

462
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,159
we can construct a system of nonlinear

463
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,280
equations in terms of the key bits and

464
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
of degree

465
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
two to the r minus one rather than two

466
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,039
to the r minus one plus one from many

467
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,039
implanted cycle test pairs

468
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,120
so in a sense

469
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,200
dark star is weaker than a star

470
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
in summary

471
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
uh

472
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
so this is a summary of our results

473
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,960
first

474
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,080
based on the improvements of of the

475
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
linearization attack we directly

476
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
broke two out of three instances of hr

477
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
star second

478
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,880
the generic linear rating attacks on

479
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
arsta and dasta

480
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
are all improved

481
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
by one more round for most instances

482
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,840
second third

483
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
uh

484
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,440
that star is weaker than asta that's

485
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
violating the designer's claim

486
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
in conclusion our analysis shares new

487
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
insights into the large-scale

488
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
cooperation

489
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
moreover our analysis also shares new

490
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
insights into how to analyze the

491
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,720
aster-like primitives

492
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
finally

493
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
we significantly improve the

494
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
linearization attacks on astar and the

495
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
duster

496
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
moreover we believe that it is

497
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
interesting to further investigate

498
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
whether it is possible to construct

499
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
non-linear equations of lower degree

500
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,679
for the asta family

501
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,440
if it is feasible we may even break

502
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,000
after and the duster

503
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,840
that's all thank you
