00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,000
hello everybody

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,920
this is a recording of our asia group

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,480
2021 paper gentry which is typed a

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,320
functionifiable non-adaptively sound

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
snark my name is helgelitma and the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,639
paper is co-authored with katarina

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
pawlik they both work at similar uab

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,400
park in norway

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
sorry if i

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,160
sound a bit off because i'm still sick

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
this paper

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,640
is about non-interactive zero knowledge

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,279
so let us briefly recap the notion the

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,960
case of music

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
there are two players the program the

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,120
verifier

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,399
the prover

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
and verifier both share the public input

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
but prover also has access to a private

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,760
witness

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,719
the goal of the music proof is for the

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,520
prover to convince the verifier

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
that the public inputs satisfy some

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,760
properties or as we say belongs to some

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
language l

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,079
to do that the prover

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,039
creates

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,159
a proof

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
pi and sends it to the verifier

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,320
and the verifier can just check whether

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,159
the proof uh given the input and the

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,640
proof whether the input belongs really

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
to this language

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
more precisely we are going to talk

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
about something that is called succinct

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
non-interactive argument

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
so let us recall

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,640
the security and efficiency properties

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,360
of

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
a succinct music

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
first of all it has to satisfy

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
completeness that means that the honest

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,479
brewer

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,680
must convince the honest verifier

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,799
second it has to satisfy soundness which

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
means that honest verifier does not

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
accept dishonest proverbs third

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,600
it has to satisfy zero knowledge

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
which means that

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
the honest proverbs private information

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
is not leaked

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
so now if approved system satisfies

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
those three properties

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
and it has a single message

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
we say that it isn't music

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
in addition

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
if it satisfies the following efficiency

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
property we have a succinct music

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
the property as follows

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
it just states

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,599
that

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
both the proof length

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,239
and the verifier's verification time

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
must be small

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
compared to the witness length

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
or ideally even compared to the input

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,599
length

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
in that case

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
we have a succinct music or as it is

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
more popularly known a snark a succinct

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,679
non-interactive argument

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
why is one working on snarks

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
by now this is quite obvious because

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
there's just a lot of money in it

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
there are hundreds of papers in top

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
conferences that all propose

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
new snarks

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,599
or variants of their thereof for

79
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
different applications

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
they are actually used prominently in

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,599
the real life

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
and if you look at the snark papers

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
they all claim the following thing

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
our construction is based on

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,400
non-falsifiable assumptions due to the

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
impossibility result of gender weak

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
student 11

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
our paper

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,640
is about this last statement

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,280
but before

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
explaining gentry weeks let me just

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,760
briefly mention

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
that in the world of zero knowledge

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
there's a lot of known impossibility

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,799
results for example nizik is impossible

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
in the plane model

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
and thus people use the crs model where

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
it is assumed that there is a trusted

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
party who outputs a common common input

100
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
to all parties

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
it is also known that succinct zero

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
knowledge proofs are impossible for np

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
and because of that people use what is

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
called arguments

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,080
that these computational sound proofs

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
third

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
it is known that fansifiable perfect

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
zero knowledge is impossible for np

109
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,880
and this is why people either use

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
non-fansifiable assumptions

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
or they

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
use computational zero knowledge

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
and there's a lot of different

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
impossibility results

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,599
too many to mention

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
in many of those cases known

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
impossibility possibility results match

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
for example

119
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
music is impossible in the play model

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
but there's a plethora of physics

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
that are

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
known to

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
known to be secure in the crs model

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
so what is the change

125
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,680
this famous gentry week's result about

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
it basically states that the following

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
four properties cannot be achieved at

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,759
the same time

129
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
adaptive soundness succinctness

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
hard languages and fansifiable

131
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
assumptions

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
and while i i'm prominently mentioning

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
mentioning gentry weeks there's actually

134
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,039
several papers that have shown that this

135
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
combination is

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
non-achievable

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
they just work

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
for slightly different

139
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,400
notion of reductions

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
so what are those four

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
four properties about

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,880
first of all succinctness

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
means that you want to have efficient

144
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
communication and efficient verification

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,280
second hard languages basically means

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
that you

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
you can handle all np languages

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
which means that you can actually keep

149
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
zero knowledge proofs for something

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,479
non-trivial

151
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
adaptive soundness

152
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
is a bit more trickier property

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
it just means

154
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
that yours

155
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,520
your proof system must be sound even if

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
the chosen input depends on the crs

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
and finally fanciful assumptions

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
are assumptions where

159
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
intuitively one can efficiently check if

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,960
the assumption was broken

161
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
one can argue

162
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
that the first three

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,759
properties

164
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
are really necessary

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,560
for nesix or snarks to be used in

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
practice

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
you want efficiency you want to be able

168
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
to

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,960
do expressive languages and you want to

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,319
have this adaptive service property on

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
the other hand

172
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
the last property

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
has not been

174
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
important in practice

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
people are still using snarks

176
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
and they are implementing it and there's

177
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,039
a lot of money

178
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,080
on it

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,960
even if the snarks

180
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
are based on non-fanciful assumptions

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
and the reason for that

182
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,759
is that

183
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,400
you must use non-fanciful assumptions to

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,759
get the first three properties

185
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,440
however

186
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,319
non-fanciful assumptions are quite

187
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
poorly understood

188
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,479
as they could be potentially broken

189
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,879
if not in theory than in practice

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
now when we look at this gentry week's

191
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
result

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
as i said

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
it basically states that one cannot

194
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
achieve the four

195
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
properties at the same time

196
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
on this

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,960
good evidence showing that this is tight

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
there's a very famous result by phil

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,520
galapitot and samir from 1991

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
they achieve adaptive soundness hard

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
languages intensifiable assumptions but

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
their argument system is not succinct

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
there's a more recent work on delegation

204
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
schemes

205
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
that achieves all the other properties

206
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
but it works only for the complexity

207
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
class b

208
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
and there's a the famous line of work on

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,760
snarks

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
that achieves all other properties

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
but

212
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
they are based on non-fanfall

213
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
assumptions

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,800
curiously

215
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
this gap here

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,600
basically there's no previous work

217
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
that proposes succinct

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
arguments for hard languages based on

219
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
functional

220
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,440
that are possibly

221
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,519
or necessarily non-adaptive

222
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
this is the main result of the current

223
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
paper

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
so

225
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,600
because

226
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
non-adaptive soundness is so important

227
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,360
in the current paper

228
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,279
we will

229
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
explain it a bit

230
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
more in the next slides

231
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
so first of all

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
i already mentioned the crs model

233
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,519
all practical snarks work in this model

234
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
in that model you assume the existence

235
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
of a trusty third party

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
and then you have prover and verifier

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,920
the trusted third party generates

238
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
honestly

239
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,839
a crs and sends it to the approver and

240
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,240
the verifier

241
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
after that

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,880
prover chooses a common input and a

243
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
secret witness

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
the fact that

245
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,079
it is chosen after crs is important

246
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,240
because it might depend on the crs

247
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
then prover since the common input

248
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
the argument to the verifier who uses

249
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
the crs

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
to check whether the statement is true

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
again

252
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,399
this is this common adaptive case

253
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
where the crs is created in the

254
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
beginning

255
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
and we want to have soundness ever in

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,480
the case

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,920
when the input is chosen maliciously

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,839
in a way that it depends on the crs

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,880
now non-adaptive case has a subtle

260
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
difference

261
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,320
namely in that case the prover first

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
chooses the input and the witness and

263
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
sends the in input to the verifier

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
and only then

265
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
they receive crs from the trusted third

266
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
party

267
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,839
and then prover creates an argument and

268
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,560
sends it to the verifier

269
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,160
note that it does not mean

270
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
that non-adaptive

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,519
music or snark

272
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,880
requires this temporal order

273
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,720
what it means is that

274
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
soundness is only guaranteed in the case

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
where the input does not depend on the

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,119
crs

277
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,760
so what are our results

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
most importantly

279
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
we propose

280
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,800
fauna which is a fancifiable

281
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,120
non-adaptively sound snark for np

282
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
it is succinct

283
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
the argument is only 14 group elements

284
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
but this closes the gap in gentry weeks

285
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,360
in this sense we see it as an important

286
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,839
theoretical

287
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,440
but also fauna itself is concretely

288
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
quite efficient

289
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
we also prove that fauna satisfy some

290
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,760
additional properties

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
first of all in our main result

292
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
we just show the whale is non-adaptable

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
sound under falsifiable assumptions

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,639
in addition

295
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,240
we show that

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
it is non-adaptively knowledge sound in

297
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,320
the algebra group model

298
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,839
and we also show that it is subposition

299
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,600
zero knowledge

300
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
that means zero knowledge even if the

301
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,519
proverb doesn't trust the crs generator

302
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,519
under the non-fanfarable assumption

303
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,120
in both of those cases it is known

304
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,760
that non-fanciful assumptions are needed

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,959
our major public clocks are

306
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,880
a so-called pile lateral subspace

307
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
quasi-adaptive nizik

308
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
and the functional somewhat

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
statistically a binding commitment

310
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
scheme

311
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
the paper also

312
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
has many new results

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
about this bls kinesic

314
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
that i'm not going to present in this

315
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,839
talk

316
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,480
what is the first idea about

317
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,160
fauna

318
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,120
so

319
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,240
it functions initially as a lot of

320
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
the first first generation snarks

321
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,519
the prover uses a perfectly hiding

322
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,959
commitment scheme

323
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,920
to commit separately to three vectors

324
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
the vector for left inputs of all gates

325
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
the vector of all right inputs and the

326
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
vector of all outputs

327
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
so this is like in this standard qap

328
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,079
language

329
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,638
so a

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,360
so for example the first commitment

331
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,519
is

332
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,320
an extended person commitment

333
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
to the witness z

334
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
where the

335
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,320
set of generators is equal to u1 to um

336
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,399
where u1

337
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,760
or let's say ui interpolates the eighth

338
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
column of u

339
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
and u v and w are public matrices

340
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
describing the circuit

341
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,560
this is

342
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,000
very standard in this

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
class of

344
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
class of non-universal snarks

345
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
the most famous of which are pinocchio

346
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
and crotch 16.

347
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
the next step is that we use

348
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
the bls kinesic to prove

349
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,680
that such a witness exists

350
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
exists

351
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
so the goal of the carnegie

352
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,519
is to prove that there exists

353
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,639
exists a weakness z

354
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
such that y1 is equal to m1 times z and

355
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
y2 is equal to m2 times z

356
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,560
where y1 is a vector of group elements

357
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,639
in group 1

358
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
and y2 is a vector of group elements in

359
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
group 2

360
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,320
and we use a pairing based setting

361
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,399
the

362
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,360
bls konisik is from the paper of

363
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,839
consoles etc from asia group 2015

364
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,480
and it is succinct

365
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
the

366
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
consists of four group elements

367
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
and it is based on the fanciful

368
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
assumption

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,880
s

370
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,439
mdh

371
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,560
now in the soundness reduction

372
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,839
one usually needs to extract the witness

373
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,440
zed

374
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
in the case of snarks

375
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
this is done by relying on a

376
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
non-fanciful assumption

377
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
and one gets a succinct argument

378
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
on the other hand

379
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
if you

380
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
don't use a non-functional assumption

381
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
then

382
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
to extract

383
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
you need

384
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
something that is longer

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
than the

386
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,680
witness

387
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,920
for example you just need

388
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
to encrypt the witness

389
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,040
and this contradicts

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
the succinctness requirement

391
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,359
to solve this issue

392
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,199
earlier papers of taza etc and fawzi etc

393
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,359
consider something that is called local

394
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,640
extraction

395
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,360
and thus achieve fanciful assumptions

396
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
so what is local extraction

397
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,480
basically

398
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,839
this is a

399
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,320
variant of extraction very useful in a

400
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
soundless

401
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,640
and it

402
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
it allows

403
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
one to have

404
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
a succinct commitment and the success

405
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,000
argument

406
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
basically

407
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
in in the soundness proof you know that

408
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
the adversary cheated

409
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
so instead of

410
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,039
creating a long long weakness of this

411
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,120
where a lot of the entries of the

412
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,640
witness might not be necessary

413
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,520
you do the following you guess where

414
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
exactly the adversary cheated

415
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,360
that is

416
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
in the case of circuits which gate was

417
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
miscomputed

418
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,200
then you prepared the crs

419
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
so that one can efficiently extract

420
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,360
a succinct local witness showing that

421
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
this concrete gate was miscomputed

422
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
note that you do not care about other

423
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,840
gates it is

424
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,640
sufficient derail derive a contradiction

425
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
from the miscomputation of a single gate

426
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,120
then

427
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
one reduces soundness to a fancy viable

428
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,640
assumption that uses only the succinct

429
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
local witness

430
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
note that here

431
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
one has a security loss

432
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
of the number of the caged times because

433
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
of the guessing the gate number if the

434
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
case was incorrect then the soundness

435
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
address or the soundness reduction

436
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,799
aborts

437
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
this idea was used in those two

438
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,520
preliminary papers does etc and fawzi

439
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
etc

440
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
but

441
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,919
they

442
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,360
their schemes are actually quite

443
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
different

444
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,240
so they still rely on a non-succinct

445
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
commitment

446
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,799
they are quasi attempted physics

447
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
while our our goal is to have something

448
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
that is not not quasi-adaptive

449
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,080
they are quasi-adaptively sound

450
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,720
which is a notion orthogonal to

451
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
non-adaptive soundness and it is

452
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
it is something that falls under gentry

453
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
weeks

454
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,559
it is causing that zero knowledge etc

455
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
so basically

456
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,280
they are in this corner of a scheme

457
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,200
that doesn't contradict gentry wicks

458
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,559
because they are not not succinct

459
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
so i would argue that their schemes are

460
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,640
actually not natural starting points

461
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
now the only reason we knew how to start

462
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
from there

463
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,159
is that i'm a co-author of the second

464
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,600
paper

465
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
and once i had a doubt

466
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
about its security proof i tried to

467
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
modify it

468
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,720
and then suddenly i got something

469
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
completely different

470
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
so let us look at this adaptive service

471
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
proof

472
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,679
of

473
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,400
the two previous papers

474
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,200
the

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,320
i'm going to present the proof

476
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,200
in a linear manner

477
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
in actuality

478
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
it it has several

479
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,559
games

480
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,200
in each games one does

481
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,360
some modification

482
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,880
then you have adversary in the last game

483
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,280
but in this nonlinear or in this linear

484
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
manner

485
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,960
the pro the soundness proof

486
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
looks like that

487
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
adversary commits

488
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
to witness by using

489
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
a non-succinct perfectly binding

490
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,080
commitment

491
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,200
then

492
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
the game guesses a gate with adversary

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,360
cheats

494
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,679
and aborts

495
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,840
later

496
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,520
when the guess was incorrect

497
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,120
now

498
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
we extract the local witness from the

499
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,679
perfectly binding commitment

500
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,039
and reject

501
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,480
if the guess was wrong

502
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,200
we modified the crs to allow local

503
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
extraction at the gate

504
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,000
j

505
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,039
we then we obtained the argument from

506
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
the adversary

507
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
and now we are in a situation where we

508
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
did not reject

509
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
since the commitment is perfectly

510
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,720
binding

511
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
this is a very important observation

512
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,000
the adversary's input does not depend on

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
the crs

514
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,440
because we did not modify commitment

515
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
perfectly binding commitment after

516
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,919
modifying the crs

517
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,200
hence

518
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
the gate where adversary cheated does

519
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
not depend on the crs

520
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,360
and

521
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
because of that we get

522
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,799
an

523
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,280
adept adaptive soundness or more

524
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,159
precisely quasi-adaptive soundness but

525
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
it's still like almost adaptive

526
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
um

527
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,600
because the scheme achieves adaptive

528
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,080
softness or those schemes

529
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
from the two previous papers achieve

530
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
adaptive soundness

531
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,520
they contradict gentry weeks

532
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
unless

533
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,000
one uses a perfectly finding commitment

534
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
so

535
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
one very important tool that is used in

536
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,799
the two previous papers and in our

537
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,559
new paper is functional ssp commitment

538
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,799
somewhat statistically upon a commitment

539
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
in that case the commitment key

540
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,440
fixes

541
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
q linear functions

542
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,679
think of q as being a small constant

543
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
like four

544
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,919
that means that the commitment key

545
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,960
basically contains

546
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,480
the description

547
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
of q linear functions

548
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,039
each must by some randomness

549
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,760
uh the randomness is needed because

550
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,640
the commitment key has to hide

551
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
the choice of the functions that is if

552
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,240
you change the functions

553
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
the commitment key should look the same

554
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
to the adversary

555
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
then

556
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,799
this commitment scheme is succinct

557
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
basically

558
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
the message

559
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,039
can be some n elements long

560
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,279
where n is a large parameter depending

561
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,919
on the circuit size in our application

562
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
but the commitment is still succinct

563
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,159
so in the

564
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
case of the fauzi etc scheme the length

565
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
of the commitment is q plus one group

566
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
elements

567
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
now when you are given extraction key

568
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,080
then you can actually extract those q

569
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
linear functions

570
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
of the concrete input from the

571
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
commitment

572
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
that is

573
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,960
you can extract

574
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
the sum of alpha i j m j etc etc

575
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
but importantly they are only extracted

576
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
as group elements

577
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,919
this is again something that is uh

578
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
very standard because we are working in

579
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
the group based setting

580
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,559
and extraction very often means

581
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,440
just

582
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
decryption by using a cleverly chosen

583
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
secret key

584
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,159
this notion was defined in the paper

585
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,440
fawzi

586
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
myself and others

587
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,400
in a paper of this year

588
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,919
and

589
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,600
as i mentioned

590
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
in our scheme the commitment length is q

591
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
plus one group elements

592
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
informally the scheme was already used

593
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,400
before

594
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
but there was no proper formalization of

595
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,039
it

596
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,520
importantly importantly

597
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
the fssp commitment scheme is secure

598
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,720
under tdh

599
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
which is the most standard falsifiable

600
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,080
assumption

601
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,240
so how do we use fhsp in fauna

602
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,720
we use it for local extraction

603
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,440
we need linear functions

604
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
of the input for the full reduction to

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,799
work

606
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,640
unfortunately i have no time to explain

607
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
this point here

608
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,159
the two previous papers also used fssp

609
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,640
but they used it for a different purpose

610
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
the idea of the use is that we use those

611
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,080
linear functions on the run

612
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
depending on the guest

613
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
gate

614
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
and then program crs

615
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,360
and the crs has a fssp commitment key

616
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
that depends on those newly chosen

617
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,400
linear functions

618
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,120
the problem here

619
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
is that

620
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,200
in the adaptive case the malicious

621
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,520
a can choose input depending on the crs

622
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
and because the crs

623
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,600
depends on the gate number

624
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,120
a malicious adversary can

625
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,600
use some tricks

626
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,640
so that this miscomputer gate number

627
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,559
changes

628
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,520
so

629
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
the crs

630
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,760
is programmed to detect

631
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,880
cheating on

632
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,799
kj

633
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,679
but after the crs malicious adversary

634
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,399
can choose

635
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,960
a new input

636
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,840
and

637
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
miscompute

638
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,480
some other gate

639
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,840
now this is exactly ifana is

640
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,639
non-adaptive

641
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
because the definition of non-adaptivity

642
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,120
means that basically a cannot change the

643
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,679
input depending on the crs

644
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,600
and those a also cannot change the

645
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
miscomputer k

646
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,879
depending on the series

647
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,679
what we achieve

648
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,840
is

649
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
succinctness we will not need perfectly

650
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
binding commitment anymore

651
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,240
but we lose adaptivity

652
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,399
so this is a trade

653
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,559
and exactly this is how

654
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,000
we

655
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
fill the gap in gentry weeks

656
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,039
so

657
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
just to recap

658
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,640
in our non-adaptive soundless proof

659
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,039
the proof is more modern

660
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
after the adaptive sunless proof of the

661
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,600
previous papers

662
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,159
with some subtle differences

663
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,399
so first of all

664
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
that also recommends that the witness by

665
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,640
using a succinct fssp commitment

666
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,000
i've underlined the important changes

667
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,960
from this previous service proof

668
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,360
then the game guesses a gate where the

669
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,399
adversary cheats

670
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,320
then we force the a to fixed input so

671
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
the input

672
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
this should actually be even higher

673
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,360
higher up because the input cannot

674
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,880
depend on this gate

675
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
and we can do this fixing because we

676
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,960
have a non-adaptive security proof

677
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,320
after that

678
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,039
we modify the crs to allow local

679
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,799
extraction at the gate j

680
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,640
and we obtain the argument from

681
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
adversary

682
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,200
again

683
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,919
here j did not change

684
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,399
because the input was fixed

685
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,320
before the crs modification

686
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
after that we extract local witness from

687
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
the fssp commitment and rejected the

688
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,159
guest restraunt

689
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
note that this is maybe

690
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,640
the biggest change in the proof

691
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
we extract the local weakness from the

692
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,960
success commitment

693
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,799
while in the previous papers they

694
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
extracted

695
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,799
they extracted a short succinct local

696
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,559
witness but they extracted it from a

697
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,760
perfectly binding commitment

698
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,520
for the reason that perfectly binding

699
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
commitment

700
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,760
did not depend on the crs

701
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
because of this change

702
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
we also have

703
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
pushed

704
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
the rejection

705
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,279
a bit

706
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,399
later

707
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
because we first have to

708
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,279
do the crs modification

709
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,640
and obtain the argument from adversary

710
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,600
the argument contains fssp commitment

711
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,799
that we use

712
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
to check whether the gate was correctly

713
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,320
completed or not

714
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,399
and now since we did not reject

715
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,399
and we have non-adaptive soundness

716
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
that resource input does not depend on

717
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,039
the crs

718
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,440
hence the gate for

719
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,519
the adversary cheat it does not depend

720
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,039
on the crs

721
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,440
it's still the same k j

722
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,000
and hence we get non-adaptive sounds

723
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
do not contradict gentrifics we require

724
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,080
non-adaptive soundness because in this

725
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,639
case we have a fully succinct argument

726
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,320
fauna itself looks deceptively simple

727
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,559
it is in the crs model

728
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,039
of the crs contains

729
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,120
the commitment key of the fssp

730
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,760
it has the language parameter

731
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
of the bls kinesic

732
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,360
so i'm not going to explain it here

733
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,600
but what makes an easy cacao music is

734
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
that they have a language parameter

735
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,480
on top of those two things

736
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
the rest of the crs is very simple

737
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,679
it's just a bunch of monomials

738
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,039
given

739
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,919
in both groups

740
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,799
however despite of this deceptive

741
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
simplicity

742
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
i have to say that the language

743
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,799
parameter of the bls is circuit

744
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,760
dependent

745
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,880
this means that the crs

746
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
is circuit dependent

747
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
and it is an interesting open question

748
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
to design a

749
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,439
universal version of fauna

750
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
what is the prover to

751
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,640
prover

752
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
initially acts

753
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,080
as in

754
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
traditional

755
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,440
pinocchio or chichi pr type starks for

756
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,120
qip

757
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,480
it outputs four group elements acb

758
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,559
that are perfectly hiding commitments to

759
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,200
the witness

760
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,720
and eight

761
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,600
which is uh

762
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
an argument

763
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,519
that enables one to verify that the

764
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,880
officer hiding commitments are

765
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,600
consistent

766
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,799
on top of it the prover creates

767
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,360
an fssp commitment to witness in both

768
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
groups

769
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,279
and it creates

770
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
a bls proof

771
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,159
that all commitments

772
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,840
perfectly hiding commitments and

773
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,120
functional ssb commitments in all in

774
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,799
both different groups

775
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,000
are to the same witness

776
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
the verifier

777
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,320
has to verify the bls proof

778
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,240
but then check

779
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,080
a snarky pairing product equation that a

780
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
times b

781
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
is equal to c

782
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
plus this value h

783
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
times

784
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,519
uh polynomial

785
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,399
z x where z is a

786
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,560
is a traditional vanishing polynomial

787
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
let us just state the main security

788
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
theorem

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,918
we have the whanau is non-adaptively

790
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,960
sound

791
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
under the following assumptions

792
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,760
they are all and the assumptions are all

793
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,918
classifiable s current may get mdh which

794
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,879
is the assumption behind bls

795
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,480
ddh which is the assumption behind the

796
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,399
functional ssp

797
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,399
and then a novel

798
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,839
qa lingers assumption

799
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
the latter assumption is a new

800
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,560
falsifiable assumption that holds under

801
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,119
the pdl assumption in the algebraic

802
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,760
group model

803
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,440
it is also a non-adaptive knowledge

804
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,560
sound in the algebra group model

805
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,000
under

806
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
two additional

807
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,919
non-diversifiable assumptions

808
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,520
and it is subversion zero knowledge

809
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,079
under the ddh

810
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,720
and the new non-falsifiable

811
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,640
knowledge assumption

812
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
which we also proved to be secure in the

813
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,920
algebraic code model

814
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,960
rest of the paper

815
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,119
the paper is actually quite long and it

816
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
has a lot of different

817
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
results

818
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,119
we first of all

819
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
because we use pls

820
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,640
qa nisk

821
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,839
a lot

822
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,599
we also approve

823
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,320
several new properties of it first of

824
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,760
all we prove we define and prove

825
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
that this it is sigma sigma strongly

826
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
sound this is a completely new security

827
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,119
property

828
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,839
we also prove that it is adaptively

829
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,280
sound

830
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
which is

831
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,440
by itself very interesting because

832
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,320
one only knew before that it is quasi

833
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,400
about the result

834
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
we proved that it is adaptively

835
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
knowledge sound this

836
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,880
knowledge sounds of pls was not known

837
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,920
before

838
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,680
and we proved that it is subtraction

839
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,399
zero knowledge

840
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,599
then as said

841
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,240
we have a new security assumption qa lin

842
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,680
dress

843
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,160
we motivate it and prove that it is

844
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
secure in the agm

845
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,520
and we also argue that this assumption

846
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,880
is more natural than the target sdh type

847
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,000
assumptions of the tawza plus and fawzi

848
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,640
plus papers

849
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
we also proved

850
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
that this new knowledge assumption

851
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
behind subposition zero knowledge of

852
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,280
further is secure in the algebraic group

853
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,839
model

854
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
and we hope that those results are

855
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,280
independently interesting

856
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,599
i personally think the bls

857
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,800
khanzik can have many applications in

858
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,119
fancy philosophical settings

859
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
and qa lin dress

860
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
is a completely different type of

861
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
assumption

862
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,640
that might generate some new research

863
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,280
thank you very much

864
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
and

865
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,079
i'm looking forward to comments

866
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,119
thank you

867
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,440
bye bye
