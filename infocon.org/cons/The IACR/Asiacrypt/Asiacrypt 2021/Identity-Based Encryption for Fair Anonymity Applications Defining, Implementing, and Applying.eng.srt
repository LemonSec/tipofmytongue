welcome to this talk about

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640
identity-based encryption for fair

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
enough material applications

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,519
defining implementing and applying

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,440
randomizable rca secure ibe

i'm e1 and this is a joint work with

fao shin wong and moti

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
yang in this talk we many consider the

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
applications of fair anonymity

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
for example in the scenario of anonymous

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,879
communication

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,719
users in the anonymity sets communicate

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
with each other in an anonymous manner

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
once someone abuses the anonymity

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,879
service

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,120
for illegal activities

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
we hope there is a trusted authority

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
that can revoke the anonymity of

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
malicious users

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
so the fair anonymity

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
aims to achieve a balance of individual

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
privacy and the zelda safety

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
obviously identity based encryption

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
namely ibe

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
is a natural candidate for such a

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,960
setting

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,000
ipg was introduced by chamia in 1980s

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
and the first efficient realization was

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,159
proposed by bonan and franklin in 2020

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,840
in

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,680
2001 in ibg

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
alice encrypts messages

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
with the identity of bob

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
for example email address

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,159
and bob can decrypt the ciphertext with

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,680
secret key

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
sk bob which is generated by the key

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
generation center

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
namely kgc

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
so the kgc can check any server test

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,199
generated by the users and play the role

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,119
of trusted authority in previous scenery

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,160
apart from the fair anonymity the other

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
properties of such anonymous

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
communication put some extra constraints

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
on the underlying encryption scheme

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,879
first

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
the scheme should support the

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,599
randomization of ciphertext

52
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
so that the server can hide the

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,640
connections of incoming and outgoing

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
ciphertext

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
in particular

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
the randomization of ciphertext

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
does not change the underlying identity

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
and the plaintext

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
so bob can still obtain the correct

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
plaintext from ciphertext c prime

61
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,319
besides it is desirable that the

62
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,200
randomization of several tests does not

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
involve any public parameters

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
second the civil test should be

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
anonymous and do not reveal any

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
information

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
about the identity of the receiver

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
otherwise the attacker can correlate

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
several tests with respect to

70
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
underlying identity

71
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,599
as the randomization of ciphertext does

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,359
not change the identity

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
third the encryption scheme should be

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
secure against active attacker who can

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
probe the servo with malicious

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
ciphertext

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
a combination of those constraints

78
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
points at

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,959
randomizer randomizability

80
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
receiver anonymity and rca security

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
in particular rtc security is a

82
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,280
meaningful relaxation of

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
csa security for public key encryption

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,360
and it is compatible with

85
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,320
randomizability

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,759
so we turn to study how to achieve those

87
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,040
properties

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,360
in the context of ibe simultaneously

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
here are our main results

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
first we define a new security notion

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,120
called anonymous identity-based

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
rca security for ipg

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
then we implement

94
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,320
a concrete ibe scheme that satisfies

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,240
anonymous id ssa security

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
and randomizability

97
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
finally we apply this ibe scheme to

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,759
build identity based universal mixed net

99
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
with fair anonymity

100
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
now we introduce the identity definition

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,039
of anonymous id rca security first

102
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
in fact gentry has defined the notion of

103
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
anonymous id

104
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
cca security already

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
at eurocrypt 2006

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
it is a combination of

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
idcca security and receiver anonymity

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
in the security gap

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
adversary first chooses two identities

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
id 0 id 1

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
under 2 plaintext

112
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,560
m0 m1

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
after receiving the public parameters

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
generated by the challenger

115
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
and then

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
it is required to guess the identity idb

117
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
and the plaintext mc of challenge

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
ciphertext c start generated by the

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,919
challenger

120
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
during the whole game

121
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
the adversary is granted access to key

122
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,880
generation and decryption aurora and

123
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,520
decryption oracles

124
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
we imitate the definition of rcca

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,919
security to formalize the notion of

126
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,759
anonymous id rcca security

127
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,479
the main difference between anonymous

128
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,840
idcca and

129
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,720
idrca security lies in the decryption

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
oracle

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,479
specifically in the decryption oracle of

132
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,400
anonymous id rca security

133
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,759
if identity if identity id

134
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,680
is equal to either

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
id 0 or id1

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
the challenger would decrypt the

137
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
ciphertext c

138
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,120
with both

139
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
sk id 0 and sk id1

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
and check whether the decryption results

141
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
intersect the plain text picked by

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,599
adversary

143
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
otherwise the challenger decrypts c

144
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,000
with skid only and check whether m is

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
equal to

146
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
either m0 or m1

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,400
anyway

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
those additional actions prevent

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
adversary from winning the game

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
trivially

151
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,080
next we'll introduce how to build a

152
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,440
randomizable ipg

153
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,080
with anonymous id rca security

154
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
at the core of our construction is the

155
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
double-strand paradigm

156
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
in the aogama based universal

157
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
cryptosystem

158
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,199
the ciphertext of

159
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
text m

160
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,720
is composed of two strands of aor gamma

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
encryptions

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
eyn and the ui1

163
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
by the homomorphic properties of the

164
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
eogama encryption

165
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
strength eyewear can be used to

166
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,039
randomize both eym and itself correctly

167
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,919
so

168
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,880
the double strand paradigm offers an

169
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,640
elegant way to re-encrypt safer tests

170
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
without any public parameters

171
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,920
however

172
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,800
this paradigm cannot be applied to the

173
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
well-known gentry ipg

174
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
as

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
idcca security contradicts to the

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
homomorphic property

177
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
to overcome this issue we describe the

178
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,160
gantry ipg scheme briefly

179
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,240
let e be the symmetric by linear map

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,839
p be the

181
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
random generator of g

182
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
a in brackets denotes ap and a in

183
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
brackets t

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,000
denote epp to the a

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
the server test of country ibe consists

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
of

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
three parts

188
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
keys of a test

189
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
dataset test

190
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
and validity tracking

191
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,320
during the decryption procedure

192
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
the validity tracking part is used to

193
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,240
test the validity of ciphertext

194
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
while the keys of a test is decrypted to

195
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
obtain the session key for recovering

196
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,359
the plain text from data ciphertext

197
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
in particular the value of vector beta

198
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
in x4

199
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
changes with x1 to x3

200
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,640
so we're encrypting ciphertext eidm

201
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
with eid1 would not get a valid

202
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,399
ciphertext

203
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
consider that

204
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
re-encryption does not change the

205
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,320
plaintext m we modify vector beta in x4

206
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
to vector mu

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
and obtain a variant of gantry ibg

208
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
the vector mu includes the hash value of

209
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,680
plaintext m

210
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
now we can obtain a gantry ibe-based

211
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
universal cryptosystem

212
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,880
by applying the variant of country ibe

213
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
to the double strength paradigm

214
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
however this construction does not

215
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,640
satisfy anonymous id rcca security

216
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
because

217
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,160
the adversary in the security game

218
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
can guess the plaintext

219
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,519
and

220
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
re-encrypt strength eidm

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
by performing

222
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,720
exponentiation with it

223
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
and verify the guess

224
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
by curing the decryption oracle

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,518
so we have to restrict the manner of

226
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,440
randomization to defend against previous

227
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,399
attack

228
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
we introduce extra components

229
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,320
in the validity checking part of both

230
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
strains

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,480
and perturb the randomness as

232
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
instrument eidm

233
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,839
with

234
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,120
c0 and z1

235
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,079
however

236
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,880
adversary is still able to

237
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,839
re-randomize e-i-d-m

238
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,560
by performing multiplication

239
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
with

240
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
public parameter identity

241
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
and

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,639
plaintext

243
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
to restrict the randomization minor

244
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,680
further

245
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
we'll mask the validity checking part

246
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
with the secret value u

247
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,920
and encapsulate u with another two

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,040
strings

249
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
e prime idu and the e prime id1

250
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,600
the random value u shot among those four

251
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,639
strings

252
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,000
prevents adversary from obtaining valid

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,360
ciphertext

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
by mixing strings from different

255
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,360
ciphertext

256
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
or randomizing strengths with public

257
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,480
parameters

258
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
now there is only one way to randomize

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,319
the zephyr test

260
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
improve the anonymous id and cca

261
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
security of our construction we make

262
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
negotiable modifications to the

263
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
simulation of security gain step by step

264
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
first the setup and extraction

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
algorithms are modified to generate

266
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
sacred keys without master

267
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,240
key then the challenge plan server test

268
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
is computed using alternative encryption

269
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,440
algorithm such that the distribution of

270
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
ciphertext is independent of the

271
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,719
underlying identity idb and plaintext mc

272
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
finally the challenger answers all the

273
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,519
decryption queries via a time unbounded

274
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,240
decryption algorithm that uses public

275
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
parameters and the challenge several

276
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
tests only to decrypt several tests

277
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,120
at this time the ciphertext the

278
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,600
extraction and the decryption

279
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
curious do not provide extra information

280
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,000
about

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
master key and the secret keys to the

282
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
adversary

283
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,160
and the challenges of a text

284
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
perfectly hides the identity and the

285
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
plaintext

286
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,480
so the advantage of adversary is zero

287
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,360
finally we present a id based universal

288
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
mixnet based on such ibg

289
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,920
universal mixnet is usually constructed

290
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
for providing anonymous communication

291
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
among parties

292
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,680
a id based universal mixnet consists of

293
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
a bulletin board a trusted authority a

294
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
set of senders

295
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,680
receivers and mixed nodes

296
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,079
for simplicity we assume there are

297
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,600
earned senders

298
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
receivers and three mixed nodes

299
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,120
in the initialization stage the trusted

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
authorities play the role of key

301
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
generation center and generate sacred

302
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,680
keys for each users

303
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,638
and the mixed node

304
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
in the packet generation stage

305
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
suppose every sender si intends to send

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,680
messages mi to a receiver

307
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,920
r5i where function 5 is a projection

308
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
that depicts the relationship between

309
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,519
senders and receivers

310
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,880
the package

311
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,160
p1i generated by standard

312
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
si is composed of two parts

313
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,360
one is the symmetric ciphertext of

314
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
messages

315
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,399
and the other

316
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,360
is

317
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,600
ibes have a test of symmetric keys

318
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
all the packets are uploaded to the

319
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,880
bulletin board

320
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
then the first mixed node m1 downloads

321
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,519
all the packets and performs mixing

322
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
operations

323
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,160
in particular it decrypts the first ibes

324
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
of a test

325
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
in packet p1i

326
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
to obtain symmetric key

327
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
k1i

328
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,399
and then decrypt the symmetric

329
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
ciphertext with k1i

330
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,800
finally

331
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,399
mixed nodes

332
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,360
m1 randomizes the rest of ibe 7 test and

333
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
generates a new packet

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
p2i

335
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,559
and uploads all the new packets to the

336
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,799
bulletin board in random orders

337
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,439
similarly mix node n2 downloads packet

338
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
from bulletin board

339
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,000
and performs same mixing operations

340
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
and uploads all the packets

341
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
p3i to the bulletin board in random

342
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
order

343
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,760
after

344
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,880
mix node n3 completing the mixing

345
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
operation

346
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,080
the receiver can download all the

347
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
packets from

348
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,000
bulletin board and decrypt every ibes

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
have a text to

350
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,760
retrieve symmetric key and decrypts the

351
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,200
corresponding

352
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
symmetric ciphertext to retrieve

353
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
messages

354
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
compared with previous previous

355
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
universal mixnet

356
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
our identity based universal mixed net

357
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
achieves fair anonymity

358
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
the trusted authority

359
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
can revoke

360
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
the anonymity

361
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
of pawn abuse

362
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,480
also

363
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,039
due to the anonymous idrca security of

364
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
ibe scheme

365
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,520
our mix net enjoys stronger unlikability

366
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,799
finally

367
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
the ibe eliminates the public

368
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,400
certificate management

369
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
and our mixnet can provide

370
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,320
more

371
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,399
covert communication for the sender

372
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
and this is all the main results of our

373
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
work

374
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,120
okay that's all thank you
