hello everyone my name is ritin xiao

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,200
my topic today is entitled with modular

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,679
design of raw symmetrical authenticated

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,599
key exchange protocols

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,400
this work is collaborating with rija and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,119
huma

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,840
in our work we focus on the specific

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
type of ake means raw symmetric ake

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,240
in such ake

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
two parties alice and bob

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,439
they send their own messages without

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
waiting the other side

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
and upon receiving the message from the

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
other side

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
each party can conclude with a session

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
key or bot

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
there is an adversary between zinc it

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
can control the communication channels

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,360
craft some party's long-term keys

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
review some real session keys

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
and review some secrets like session

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
states and ephemeral keys

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
the secret goal includes

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
craft craziness and session key in

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
distinguishability

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
in the literature many security models

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
for ake have been put forward the first

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
one is the br model it captures the

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,720
first three attacks after it the second

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
circuit class and a second models were

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,759
proposed to capture the false condition

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,119
there also exact models improving theme

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,840
to capture perfect forward accuracy

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
notice that the second and second plus

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,799
models capture session stage review

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
queries

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
while the e-sec model captures ephemeral

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,360
key reviews

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
they are different

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,079
to date fieldwork compares these models

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
the only ones stated that the ck6 plus

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,640
and eck models are incomparable in fact

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
the most reason for this is that these

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
models

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
allowed different reviews and use micro

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
notions in different ways

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
thus previous cases rays will change the

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,959
model from one to another however

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
put

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
all models into the same setting

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
there is no need to incest some minor

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
differences between these models

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
thus we may have a better understanding

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
of these models

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
today many construction have been

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
proposed in different models include

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
including efficient concrete protocols

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,040
like electromqv nexters and some use for

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
transforms

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
but there is almost no work considering

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,840
security in multiple models

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,160
simultaneously in their works a model is

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
fixed first

64
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
whether their technique can be reused in

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,480
another model or not

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
we have no clear answer before

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
in this research field we lack assess

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
systematic understanding of the

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
pre-requests for constructing secure

70
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,799
akes

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,080
both of the two questions motivate us

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
our essential goal is to give better

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,159
systematic understandings of akes

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,560
more specific in the raw symmetric

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
setting

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
the most

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
important parts of our work are a

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
succinct and comprehensible unification

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
of the existing models and modular

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
construction in the existing models

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
next i will

82
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,720
introduce the two parts respectively

83
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
in the part 1 i will give understanding

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,439
of the system model and the

85
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
security models

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,400
in the system there exists n parties

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
any two can communicate multiple times

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
and each interaction establish a station

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
key or bot

90
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
take an execution instance between two

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
parties pi and pj as an example we can

92
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,040
give a generic description of raw

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
symmetric ikeas like in this picture

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
for the party pi

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,280
it will take its own secret key ski and

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,560
the

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
public key of other party pkja as input

98
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
first it will sample the ephemeral kri

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
then it will compute

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
msg

101
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,120
i and si

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,639
uses the function

103
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
f

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
then it will send out the message

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
ms3i

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
after receiving the messages sent from

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
pj

108
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
msj

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
it will compute

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,160
sj and sij use the function f bar fc bar

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
this function can also be separated into

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
f bar and fc

113
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
to

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
compute s j and s i j respectively

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,039
finally

116
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,080
it will derive

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,360
the session key use the three key

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
materials sister and sij

119
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,000
there exactly two types of

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
important keys

121
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,759
long term key

122
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,039
like s i s j s s k i s k j and ephemeral

123
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
key

124
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,840
like r i and r j

125
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
each protocol instance will yell the two

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,280
sessions

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
to identify a session full variables are

128
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
used as sector as peer as a center as

129
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
received to denote the owner the

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,039
intended peer the message center and the

131
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
message received

132
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,160
respectively for example in such an

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
instance

134
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
the session on pi is identified as

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
p j m s g i m s g j

136
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,479
while the session rpg is identified as

137
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,919
pjpi msgj and msgi

138
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
accordingly

139
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
two notions were also defined here for

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,479
any two sessions s and s bar

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
sns prime

142
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,880
if zero owners are the peers of each

143
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
other as messages they received as a

144
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,520
messages sent

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
by other they are called matching

146
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
stations of each other

147
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
this notion is used to identify two

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
sessions involved in the same proto

149
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,639
execution instance

150
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
while for session s if the message it

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
received is sent by

152
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
s prime the s prime is called its origin

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,599
session note that this notion is used to

154
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
distinguish passive advisories for

155
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
active adversaries in a more strict

156
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
manner

157
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,280
you can imagine that message replay

158
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,919
attack is different from message

159
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,319
modification attack in some cases

160
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
here we also

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
will also notice that

162
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
merchandising exists imply

163
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,639
origination exists but

164
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,638
not vice versa

165
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
before introducing the secret models we

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
also introduced several important

167
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
sanctuary notions the first perfect

168
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
forest accuracy pfs it states that the

169
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,360
compartments of long-term keys of both

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
sides do not feed the security of other

171
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,479
station keys the second is weak perfect

172
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,960
forest accuracy

173
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,680
wpfs

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
it's a weak volume of pfs

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
the set the adversary should be passive

176
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
when generating the older session keys

177
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
the third is

178
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,800
he can promise impersonal impersonation

179
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
kci in this attack the adversary club is

180
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
a long-term queue of some party bi and

181
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
then try to authenticate itself as some

182
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
other party pj

183
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,760
the last is maximal exposure mix in this

184
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,399
attack adversary can get keys on both

185
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
sides but at most one on each side

186
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
now we introduce the security modules

187
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,440
the adversary may launch active attacks

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,480
via send query and input a session and a

189
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
message it will respond as a proto

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
description the adversary can also learn

191
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,959
some secrets via crop query to learn a

192
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
party's long term key via ephemeral key

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
review query to learn all sessions if a

194
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,839
memory key

195
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,240
or via session status review query to

196
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
learn all sessions intermediates

197
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
or via session key review query to learn

198
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,959
all sessions session key here

199
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
the output of

200
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
session state review query will be

201
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,480
specified later

202
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
like other game-based definitions the

203
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
security is defined via experiments

204
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,440
between the challenger and the adversary

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
whereas anniversary can

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
adaptively make

207
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,519
allowed queries

208
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
and the test on the target session is to

209
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
choose

210
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
the real session keyword or random

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,959
session key will be returned

212
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,440
if the adversary correctly

213
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,399
guesses the random coin the challenger

214
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,760
used

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,519
and

216
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
the target session

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
is kept

218
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
fresh throughout the experiment

219
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,959
the adversary wins

220
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,839
in different models

221
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,680
different

222
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
queries are allowed of queer of course

223
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
to exclude trivial success freshness

224
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
should be carefully defined

225
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
so many details cannot be included in

226
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
this topic but

227
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,800
they can be found in our paper

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
here we should notice that

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,640
in the ck and second plus models session

230
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,680
state review query is allowed but in the

231
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,440
second model only ephemeral key review

232
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,519
is allowed next

233
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
we should clearly define the output of

234
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
session stage review to see their

235
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
differences

236
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
once again we take one session as an

237
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
example its lifetime can be viewed as

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
the four steps some intermediates are

239
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
passed from one to the next

240
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
can these

241
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
all be reviewed

242
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
in particular in the last

243
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
slot all session key materials are

244
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,279
included

245
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
of course in all models session stage

246
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,600
review is forbade on the target session

247
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,079
and it's my training station to avoid

248
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
trivial success but that's all for other

249
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
sessions related to the target section

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
this query is allowed something went

251
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
wrong

252
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,600
here we give an example

253
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
three execution instances are given here

254
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
the adversary

255
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,880
the message

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,399
mj star and mi star generated in the

257
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,440
first

258
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
to respectively activate new sessions on

259
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,760
pi

260
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,560
and

261
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
pj there are four sessions and they can

262
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,560
be identified as in this blue box

263
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,279
assume the target session of the

264
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,480
adversary is this session

265
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
according to the definition its matching

266
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
session is this one

267
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,959
and its session key is determined by

268
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,839
three parts three key

269
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,040
materials three

270
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
key materials as i start as just and as

271
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
i just start notice that in these two

272
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
number transitions

273
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,079
as gesta and si star appeared

274
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
the advisor request requery session

275
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
stage review query unseen and in

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
addition to review

277
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,760
the informal key of the target session

278
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,440
it can

279
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,680
get as i start as and the js desktop and

280
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
the computer as i just started by itself

281
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,440
thus is a trivialistic set

282
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
to avoid this

283
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
the

284
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,320
session stage review query is shut down

285
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
in this slot

286
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
but we should notice that the session

287
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
stage review still lists more than

288
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,959
ephemeral q review

289
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,360
because besides our

290
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
eye the ephemeral key it also leak

291
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
it oscillates as i

292
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,279
to make these models more succinct and

293
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,560
comprehensible we formulated them as in

294
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,040
this models

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
in the

296
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
models on the left

297
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
secret leakages are strictly limited on

298
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,279
the target station and its matching

299
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
session

300
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
while in the models

301
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,880
on the right

302
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
that are limited on the target station

303
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,519
at its origin session

304
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
due to a special case the origin station

305
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
exists but the merchant station doesn't

306
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,519
exist

307
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
the models with pfs surface deal with

308
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,600
much more complex saturations

309
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
we also notice that

310
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
the each case

311
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
in each module can be classified in the

312
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
secret notions

313
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,519
we mentioned before

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
thus with such formulations to achieve

315
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
security in these models the key

316
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
is to

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,880
achieve all these security goals

318
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,639
next i will introduce the high level

319
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
idea of

320
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,800
our modular constructions

321
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
requires a

322
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,120
generic description

323
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
here for c is used to negotiate

324
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
a key material from both parties

325
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,959
ephemeral keys

326
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,680
giving a secure implementation for aid

327
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,079
is enough to achieve

328
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,399
weak pfs

329
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
then we take f and f bar as a function

330
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
pair the paradigm of

331
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
raw symmetry akas

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,160
can be described as 2

333
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,040
2 times ffv bar plus fc plus kdf how to

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
securely implement such function pair

335
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,279
becomes our starting point

336
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
this motivates us to define a new

337
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,360
function krf

338
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,160
it's a function pair if the current

339
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,240
corresponding keys

340
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
are used

341
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,839
f bar can recover w from x y and y

342
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,199
output by f

343
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,560
two properties are required for it

344
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,160
the first one is private evaluation p e

345
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
without ek it cannot generate

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,320
a pair of x y such that f bar

347
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
f bars output are not

348
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,720
is not bought

349
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
the second is private recoverability pr

350
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
means without rk it cannot

351
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,320
recover w from x y even e k or x 2 has

352
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,680
been linked

353
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,560
according to different cases

354
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
this property is

355
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
divided into prlek

356
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,040
and prlx

357
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
these three properties are important to

358
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,000
achieve

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,839
this security

360
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
goals take and take a constraint

361
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,199
protocol

362
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
to implement fse we can get a

363
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
construction like this

364
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
for pi

365
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
it will generate a key pair p k i and s

366
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
k i

367
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,839
then it and then it will take p k i s

368
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,639
x one

369
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,280
a randomness r ris x2 to compute

370
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
y-i-w-i

371
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,080
pki and y-i will be sent out

372
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
upon receiving pkj and yj

373
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
it first recovered wj

374
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,280
and

375
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,039
computer

376
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,679
k from

377
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
ski and pkj

378
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,679
finally

379
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,200
it will

380
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,640
derive the session key from wi wj and k

381
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
for pj it

382
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
executes in a similar way

383
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,919
if the key screen protocol is passively

384
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
secure assuming krf with different

385
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,799
properties yield akas in different

386
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
models as in this table

387
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,760
the simplified proof strategies of our

388
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,880
modular construction can be abstracted

389
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
as indexed table

390
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
and the

391
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,360
detail the detail of proof

392
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
the detail of proofs

393
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,760
will not be

394
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,160
introduced in this topic

395
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,039
but

396
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,720
they can be found in our paper

397
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,400
then

398
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
then i will introduce to

399
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
enhance the versions

400
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
in the first one the key

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
the key point is that

402
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,840
the output y can be used as a public key

403
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,000
pk

404
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,559
if so

405
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
the basic construction can be improved

406
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
like this

407
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,120
here

408
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
pi

409
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,960
doesn't generate generate and send pki

410
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,039
anymore and pj doesn't generate and send

411
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,799
to send pk j anymore

412
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,679
thus the computation and communication

413
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
oversight overheads on both sides

414
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
decreased

415
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,039
in the in the second version

416
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
a public a public kpk can be used as the

417
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
output y

418
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,679
and the computation of w is allowed to

419
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,679
be delayed until some x1 is specified

420
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,520
like so

421
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
the basic construction can be improved

422
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
like this

423
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,240
here in the phase one

424
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
there is no need to compute wi

425
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,120
well its computation is delayed into the

426
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
second phase

427
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,159
and

428
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
the x1 and s1

429
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,559
is

430
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,120
set as pkj it received

431
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
note that

432
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
this enhanced construction

433
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
requires some difference requires some

434
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,679
different klf and

435
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,840
it must cannot be p

436
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
secure because

437
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
anyone

438
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
can anyone include including the

439
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,679
adversary can compute a

440
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,400
public key

441
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
apart from this

442
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
uh modular constructions will go we also

443
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
get some other results

444
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
first we use

445
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,559
we use these motor constructions to

446
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,840
explain some existing protocols in the

447
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,159
ck-6 plus eck and eck pfs models

448
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
then according our results

449
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,880
security in the eck pfs model implies

450
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
security in the sickblast pfs models

451
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,200
thus we can get some new construction in

452
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,880
the sickblast pfs model

453
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,200
and last we also give a new construction

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
according to our results

455
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
which is more efficient

456
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
than directly

457
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,960
applying a compiler on the protocol

458
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
secure in the second model

459
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,918
that's all about our results

460
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,240
thank you for your

461
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
listening
