one year from now

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
so taiwan is a very warm place

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,520
and it's a very nice place

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
most people can come in with no problems

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
and those

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
who might have uh

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
visa problems so we can assist you um

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,358
easily

i mean we have

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,159
an ensured venue and due to the pandemic

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,439
situation and we can cancel this with no

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
problems and if

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,119
sponsorship and pandemic prop situation

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,680
is under control we would likely move to

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
a downtown hotel

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
but we have a very modern

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
conference venue right now

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
and taipei is a great city uh

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,720

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,079

35
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
and with one stop flights

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
and

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,119

38
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,920
some english

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,759
