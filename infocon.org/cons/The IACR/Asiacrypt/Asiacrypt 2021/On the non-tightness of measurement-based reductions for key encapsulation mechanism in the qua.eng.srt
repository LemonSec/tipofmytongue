00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,960
hello i'm ho doonjang from sccs and this

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,480
is a journal work with the dream

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,080
function and the dream

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,840
the title of our paper is on the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,759
non-techniques of measurement-based

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,480
reduction volcanic absolution mechanism

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,560
in the quantum random occur model

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,880
as we know the currently deployed

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,439
public key primitives are difficult

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
since i say and

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,720
lip taker curve crypto his terms as the

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
security of these cryptosystems can be

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,440
easily broken by a quantum computer

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
due to this case

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,239
due to this concern many researchers

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
have began to investigate a post-quantum

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,239
cryptography and we called you like an

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,600
advocacy in short the goal of gpc is to

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
design classical uh cryptographic

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,199
systems that remain secure in the

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
presence of a quantum advisory

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,760
recently it needs to launch a pqc

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,800
project

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,920
and publish a cover proposal

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,960
including

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
public incubation

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
that is a tke

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
the digital

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,479
signature and

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,520
k income

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,799
mechanism

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
we call chem in short

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
in this talk

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
in particular more than half of the

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
submissions are kept

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
a cam consists of three algorithms the

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
key generation encapsulation and decal

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
solution

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,439
in practice

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
we usually need the cc secure cam

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
roughly speaking of the cc security of

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
a campsite science

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,520
and honestly generated session k is

44
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,960
indistinguishable from a truly random

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,520
session key even though the adversary

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,479
has

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
has a ability of requiring that the cab

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
solution oracle

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
to construct a

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
cc cam we first

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
usually first

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,598
build a cps qrpg from a post-quantum

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,879
heart problem and using us then better

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,599
generic transform we can obtain rcc

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,280
secure cam

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,319
as a fundamental

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,920
primitive cc cam can also also be used

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,200
to construct an ancient security and

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
case scenes

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
and here we mainly focus on the

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
on the generic construction of a cc and

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
came from sap

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
secure pke

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,239
based on the underlying assumptions

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
these generic constructions can be

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
grouped into two classes one is the

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
variance of the fo

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
and the other is the convergence of the

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
react achievement transformer for

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
example the

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
transformer u

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,959
we also

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
call this generic construction's epilet

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,040
generic constructions

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,400
the f4 lag construction constructions

76
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
are the only node transform from the cpp

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
to cc cam

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
in particular the apple lag generic

79
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
constructions are widely used in the

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
instagram 3

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,599
cam submissions

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
i feel like generic constructions are

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
based on an idealized model called a

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
random oco model

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
where a hash function is idealized to be

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
a publicly

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
accessible random local generic

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,879
construction in the runabout model has

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,200
gathered renewed in this imposed quantum

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
setting

91
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
because a quantum adultery can execute

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
hash function on arbitrary superposition

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,000
of inputs therefore when proving

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
proving post quantum security

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
one needs to improve security in the

96
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
quantum random local model where the

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
adversary can call the random logo with

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,399
a quantum state

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
in general quantum reality model is

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
quite difficult to deal with

101
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
since many improved techniques in the

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
random local model will be income

103
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,880
compatible with the quantum landmark

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
model

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
in the random oco model the simulator

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
naturally sends the queries to

107
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
to the genome local this is called

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
actual stability which is widely used in

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
improving security reform for community

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
equip systems and

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
computational health problems in

112
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
indistinguishable security model

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
in the con runoff model

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,800
the queries can be quantum states and

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
learning a quantum state

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
means environment which allows to

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,039
extract classical information from a

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,440
quantum state

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
in modern cryptography cryptosystem

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
constructions are usually purposed

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
together with a proof of security

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,199
typically when proving a security of the

123
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,400
scheme as

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,440
manually constraints of reduction

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,360
are that run the adversary against us

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,680
such as subroutine to

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
break the underlying hard problem team

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
in the random outcome model

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
when proving them

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
improving the nds and the cc security

131
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
of a ck tke

132
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
account and various standard assumptions

133
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
when usually construct a curb-based

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,240
reduction that user has had

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
high quality from the adversary to break

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
the underlying hard problem

137
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
in the quantum mechanical model

138
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,479
reading reading the algorithm means the

139
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,440
measuring of marrying the occurring that

140
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,919
is a quantum counterpart of coil based

141
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
reduction is called measurement based

142
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
reduction that measures the hard query

143
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
from the adversary and uses the

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,479
environment outcome to break the

145
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
underlying harder problem

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,080
test reductions with smaller tetanus gap

147
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
are desirable for practice let's

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,919
uh

149
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
t epsilon a and the t r epsilon are they

150
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
know the running times and advantages of

151
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,000
of adversary a and

152
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
and a reduction r respectively the

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,919
reduction

154
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
is said to be tight if

155
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,160
ta is about etr and the epsilon r

156
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
epsilon a is about epsilon r otherwise

157
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,400
we call the

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
uh otherwise because the

159
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
reduction is length height

160
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
a reduction is called the black box if

161
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,840
if just use the adversary input output

162
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,440
behavior and two nodes and it doesn't

163
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
do not depend on the internals like the

164
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,680
adversary could in contrast

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
a number box

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
reduction requires knowledge of the

167
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
adversary's internals

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
in general blackboard

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,919
productions are more popular than the

170
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,120
number box ones in cryptography

171
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,360
most

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
reductions in the quantum renewal model

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
are environment based and have the

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
tennis

175
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
property like this

176
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
the tr is

177
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
about ta and if

178
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
it's about

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
one over kappa

180
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
times epsilon a to the power of tau so

181
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
we call k pa and tall

182
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
uh this respect is a

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
factor of the security loss under the

184
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
degree of the security loss

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
this is

186
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,240
the current chinese result forever leg

187
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
cam constructions as we can see

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,919
the existing black box reductions from

189
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,719
standard cpu assumptions of

190
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
far from desirable due to the quadratic

191
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,480
security loss at least

192
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
although this quadratic signal loss can

193
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,920
be avoided by the recent work came

194
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
as as past

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
20 but the reduction in cases has 20

196
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
relies on

197
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
you introduce the technique called

198
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
barrier run measure that can only apply

199
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,279
to a reversible adversary

200
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
in post-quantum society most adversaries

201
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
are

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,640
even revisible since

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
most oracles

204
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
for example the carb solution

205
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
oracle in the security model can only be

206
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
classically called

207
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
while the existing black black box

208
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
reductions in the literature can cover

209
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
arbitrary adversaries

210
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
this is quite different from the results

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
in the

212
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,399
random vocal model where a linear

213
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,720
security loss can be achieved in a black

214
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,040
box manner

215
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
the quadratic

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
loss circular loss arrests from the

217
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,600
usage of the wound hiding techniques so

218
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
why would hiding technique is an

219
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
essential technique to prove

220
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,519
post-quantum security it gives a

221
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,399
reduction from an extra

222
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,959
extraction algorithm against a such

223
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,079
problem to earn a decision problem

224
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
beside the iphone

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,880
like constructions the web heading was

226
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
also used to prove the security of case

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
hinge max

228
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,760
and signatures and so on

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
recently several works tried to improve

230
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
the hardness of wellington hiding

231
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,519
however in the

232
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,240
case of evolution

233
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
the chinese improvement improvements

234
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
are only restricted to

235
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
the factor of reduction loss and

236
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,920
the quadratic loss still exists

237
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
therefore

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
our natural question is that foreign

239
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
camps and the one way to heading

240
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
technique

241
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
is the quranic scripture laws

242
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
available

243
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,920
environmental based black box reduction

244
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
in this paper we give an

245
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
affirmative

246
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
answer for for the above question

247
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
in detail for foreign camps

248
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
which will

249
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,800
environmentalize the black box reduction

250
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
from breaking the standard the standard

251
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,720
cbd security of pke to breaking the cc

252
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
security ever can

253
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
we are inevitably

254
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
quadratic low security loss

255
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,880
such an impossibility result can also be

256
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
extended to issue them

257
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,959
quadratic screw loss is also inevitable

258
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,839
when

259
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,040
when when

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
went in uh

261
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
secure a search problem into a decision

262
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
problem where the essential oil heading

263
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,199
technique in a in a black box manner

264
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
that is the current one black box when

265
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
the heading technique is essentially

266
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
optimal in terms of the

267
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
degree of reduction loss

268
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
next we show the main technique here we

269
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
just take the thick one

270
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
we have the absolute uh cam construction

271
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
you as an example

272
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
but it's not hard to extend the results

273
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,639
to other cam constructions and the

274
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
general language heading

275
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,560
in in this in the transform view

276
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,880
the 7k is derived

277
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
hmm actually is a

278
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,880
hash function and m

279
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
a message depicted

280
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,119
randomly

281
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
our proof scaling is that we first

282
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
construct a basic

283
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,079
quantum adversary with advantage at

284
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,720
least

285
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
[Music]

286
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,399
school rupee and then we show that any

287
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
measurement based black box reduction

288
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,440
that

289
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
that runs

290
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
these specific adversaries as a

291
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
subroutine

292
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
to break the uh

293
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,959
the

294
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
velvety security of the underneath here

295
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,000
we will have advantage at the most p

296
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
first we wish you how to

297
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
construct

298
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,440
this this specific adversary

299
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
as we know when when we

300
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
attack the the cc security of a cam

301
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
the adversary needs to distinguish hm

302
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
start from a uniform random uniformly

303
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,120
random key

304
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,079
the

305
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
challenge sometimes the system is is uh

306
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,680
it's a inclusion of a random m star

307
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
and the cone column b is

308
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,199
is also uniformly rendered without

309
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,279
advance the random vocal

310
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,040
uh has a useful property that if the m

311
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,959
star has not been called

312
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
as in the value h m star is uniformly is

313
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,199
uniformly random in in the anniversary

314
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
of you thus

315
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,600
distinguishing advantage is inaudible

316
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
when making no call to actually

317
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,959
themselves

318
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,399
that's the tool

319
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
to achieve our united and ledger from

320
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,959
distinguished advantages that obviously

321
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
has two query to query in

322
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,519
the random work with the mm star

323
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
in the roundabout model the adversary

324
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
can only make classical correspond to

325
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,279
the random vocal for any

326
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,480
real pin

327
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
if the adversary query aims to actuate

328
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,880
the property

329
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,320
he will

330
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,920
learn hm star wars the property and

331
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,639
break the rcc security with the

332
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,279
advantage

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,079
about p by testing whether

334
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,880
okay

335
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
k 0 is equal to k

336
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
kb

337
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
for reduction

338
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
against the

339
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,240
tpk u1cb when we see his security

340
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,279
a a natural way to is to take the

341
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
adversary query as a retained then with

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,959
the property p the reduction will retain

343
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,560
the i'm start and break the

344
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,600
recipe

345
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
security

346
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
that is the advantage of the reduction

347
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,399
and the

348
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
adversary is

349
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
approximately equal which is consistent

350
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,560

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,679
the reduction ranks

finally the reduction runs a pbg

435

retains

437
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,960
we have a two remax

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
performing additional quantum operations

um before measurement is not

441

allowed but such such an additional

442
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,159

443
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
substantially increase the reductions

445
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
because otherwise there is an

[Music]

451
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,200
we also remember that to the considered

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
reduction do not

453
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
restrict the simulations of the random

that

are the other the adversary queries and

457
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,559
thus

458
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,280
our results can cover the black box

is mere reduction

uh

473
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,559
usually treats the reduction as a

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,000
as an adversary at a ceo and reduce the

uh concretely we uh

uh

480
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
we

481
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
we

482
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
analysis is the advantage of

483
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,799
environmental basic reduction

484
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,720
um in following three cases in for the

485
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,440
first case

486
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
where the

487
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
uh where where the search

488
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,280
uh routine uh retains

489
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,360
contains no m stand

490
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,559
in this case

491
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,200
that the adversary just outputs one

492
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
without quality to edge to the random

493
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,159
occur transform the search for amsterdam

494
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
is one and the adversary can be replaced

495
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
by an anniversary

496
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,320
um

497
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
a1

498
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,360
that

499
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
always outputs one without the search

500
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
for amsterdam and the query to the

501
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,039
random coalition therefore we can easily

502
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,280
construct a meta reduction

503
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,400
mr1 that seamless you are undertake

504
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,280
take

505
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,159
the

506
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
reduction r as a subroutine to break the

wireless cpu security

508
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,000
in in particular particularly

509
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,120
the running time of the mario mr1 is

510
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,240
about the running time of r and

511
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,520
in this case

512
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
the advantage of mr1

513
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,679
is about the advantage of r

514
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
in the second case

515
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
whereas

516
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,679
where the third retain

517
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,640
read hinge m star and

518
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,720
the measurement

519
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
outcome is exam stamp

520
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,039
in this case we can bound the only gm

521
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,840
directly by p

522
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,720
and in the second in the third case

523
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
whereas um

524
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
whether

525
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,320
the 30 retains amsterdam

526
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
but

527
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
but the

528
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
the environment outcome is not m star in

529
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,600
this case the reduction just against

530
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
um

531
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
m prime

532
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,840
let's um

533
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
button it will be an adversary that

534
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
carries economy states

535
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
uh

536
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
like this

537
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,760
uh

538
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,039
like this and outputs when without the

539
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,840
34 m start

540
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,799
remains unchanged when when the

541
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,679
other is replaced by

542
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,159
a2

543
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
just as in the case one we can also

544
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,080
contract a better reaction mr2 against

545
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,840
the wireless pure security of the

546
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,919
key in in particular

547
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
the

548
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,840
running time of mr2 is about the type of

549
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,360
r and

550
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,440
and in this case the advantage mr mr2 is

551
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,640
about the definition of r

552
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,080
then according to

553
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
the above

554
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,240
analysis analysis

555
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
we can

556
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,679
can get the following

557
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,240
theorem

558
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,880
and

559
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
we can we can give the upper bound of

560
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,440
the of a general measurement based

561
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,840
reduction

562
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
that is the advantage of

563
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,039
a general environment reduction

564
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
is less than p plus

565
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,520
you know the definition of

566
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
our

567
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
r1 plus

568
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,159
data

569
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,000
mr2

570
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
approximately

571
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
as in combining

572
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,039
crms

573
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,080
3.1 3.2 we can directly have a month crm

574
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,039
which says that

575
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,240
the hour for our specific

576
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,640
anniversary the advantage episode

577
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,960
design

578
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,679
approximately a square root of epsilon r

579
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,159
minus if has epsilon

580
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,679
mr1

581
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,720
minus epsilon mr2

582
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,840
under the assumption that

583
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
the advantage of the any efficient

584
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
algorithm breaking the while institute

585
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
security of tbk is illegible

586
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,720
we can have

587
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
epsilon mr1 and epsilon mr2

588
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
reliable

589
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,720
then we can we can directly

590
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
directly derive epsilon r is

591
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,279
is less than epsilon

592
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
a to the power of 2

593
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,880
that is

594
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
so

595
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:00,880
for

596
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
for the trans transform you

597
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,559
environment based black box reduction in

598
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
the quantum realm of a model from

599
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,279
breaking the standard ymca security of

600
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,159
the under ndp to breaking the ion dcps

601
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,159
and this is a security of the result

602
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,120
camp

603
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,360
we are inevitable in

604
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,199
quadratic laws of security

605
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,120
oh here is our conclusion forever leg

606
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,080
comes we first show the chinese limits

607
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,200
of the black box reductions and improve

608
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,640
that

609
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,279
a measurement based reduction in the

610
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
quantum realm local model from breaking

611
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
the standard cpu security of the

612
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,799
underlying tke to breaking the ndcc

613
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
security of the resulting camp

614
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,559
we are inevitably

615
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,200
quadratic security loss

616
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
in percu particular

617
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,320
most black box reductions for those of

618
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,279
the camps are always tough

619
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,399
and then our resource suggests an

620
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,799
explanation from

621
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,360
for the lack of progress in improving

622
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,159
this reduction tennis in terms of a

623
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
degree of security loss

624
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
this impossibility results

625
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
can also be extended to issue the

626
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,760
terrorist limits of the general

627
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,039
black box while we do heading

628
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,919
okay

629
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,399
that's all

630
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
thanks for your attention
