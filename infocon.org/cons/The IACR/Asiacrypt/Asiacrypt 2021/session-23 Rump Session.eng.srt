00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
yes my apologies it does take a second

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,720
no problem

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,120
please go ahead

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
okay oh welcome everyone to round

5

so for further run session we have a

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
couple of talks coming up

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
and as a

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
general guideline the speakers will have

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
about one to five minutes to present

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,159
their talk and then

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,800
um we'll move on to the next speaker and

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,760
we'll introduce each of you

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
before your talk so please be ready to

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
to share your screen and to unmute your

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
microphone

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
and uh

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
with that uh let's move on to to the

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
first half of the ram session

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
which is about summer school in post

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
quantum cryptography and the talk will

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
be given by peter

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
hi can you can you see my slides uh

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,600
maybe like this

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
yes yes we can see it fine

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,080
okay thank you so i'm going to talk

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
about the summer school in post quantum

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
cryptography which is uh

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
happening next year in budapest from the

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
first to the fifth of august

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
so budapest is uh it's a fun nice city

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
with a lot of activities you can go

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
hiking you can go caving we have thermal

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
baths which uh date back to the 1500s we

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,720
have really cool pubs and nice

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,799
historical monuments

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
uh we are not on the seaside hence no

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
seafish but it's a nice place to ride

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
the bike under the rainbow and spot

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
beautiful falcons on top of the castle

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
hill

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
the last one is not actually true i just

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
wanted to make a pun with the

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
the

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
signatures uh lattice-based scheme as

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,479
well

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
um

50
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
finally we we also like to stay true to

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
ourselves and and budapest has some

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,399
truly remarkable gems

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
as you can see on these nice pictures

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
uh so a little bit of details about the

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
summer schools so it will be in the last

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
four five days uh you have we'll have a

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
lectures and exercise sessions lectures

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,959
in the morning exercise sessions in the

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,319
afternoon we'll

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,920
cover uh

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,239
many aspects of post-quantum crypto

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
lattice-based cryptography codebase

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
cryptography multivariate cryptography

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,040
isogeny-based cryptography and quantum

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
computing and this is mainly targeted at

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
master and phd students but of course

67
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,040
like early researchers are also also

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,480
welcome we have

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
excellent in life lectures

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
um

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
from who are all experts in their in

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
their fields

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
and uh so and and

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,519
the the web page of the the summer

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,440
school is not quite up yet but this will

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
eventually be the the working web page

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
of the school which hopefully will be

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
operational

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,640
uh in the next week or two thank you

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
thank you peter

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
next talk uh

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,000
will be given by claude

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
martindale

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,599
is on happening in bristol

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,120
claude are you ready let's stay yours

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
yeah

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
i'm just sharing my screen

88
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,359
okay hopefully you can see that

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
yes you can see your screen

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
great so i'm afraid i haven't got any

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
beautiful puns like peter but uh i'm

92
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
also advertising um

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
some some nice events that you can come

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
to

95
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
so this one is is very soon

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
um

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
uh so there's the isotony based

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
cryptography school that's so soon that

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
it's in summer 2020 and then it was in

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
december 2020 and then it was in

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,080
december 2021 and now it's going to be

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
in spring 2022.

103
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,519
um

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,160
and in between we had a an online event

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
uh last summer which uh perhaps some of

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,840
you have already come to so this is

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,800
almost 100 sure going to be a hybrid

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
event um

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,479
where you can either attend virtually or

110
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,840
in person

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
very likely according to international

112
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
travels you're

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
only going to be able to attend in

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,639
person if you happen to live in the uk

115
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,199
but the good news is that for all you

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,880
wonderful researchers living in asia

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,040
that that means you don't need to fly

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
across the world to to come and listen

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
um so if you're interested in this then

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
uh that's happening pretty soon

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
and but if you think oh but all i wanted

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
to do was come to bristol then you're in

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
luck because you can still come to

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
bristol next summer you can go to

125
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
peter's school in budapest and then

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
while you're in europe you might as well

127
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,280
come to bristol the week after

128
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
and come to

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
ant's algorithmic number theory

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
symposium uh the 15th edition of that

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,479
which is also going to be in bristol

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,639
and is co-located with the

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
internationally renowned uh bristol

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
balloon fiesta and this is a picture of

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
the bristol balloon fiesta so um if the

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
number theory or gets a bit too much you

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
can look in the sky and look at some

138
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,720
beautiful balloons instead

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
um

140
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
so if you want to submit a paper to ants

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
then uh you've got until the 25th of

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
february to come up with an idea like

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,919
how to spell february correctly for

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,039
example

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
um and submit that to the paper

146
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
to the conference so i hope to see you

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
all in bristol in uh

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
in the summer and perhaps virtually or

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
if you're lucky in person in february

150
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
thank you very much chloe looking

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
forward to your summer school in bristol

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
let's move to the next top the next talk

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
will be um

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
um

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
somewhat uh technical talk with the

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,360
title on the technical flaws in ccc

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
white paper episode three

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,759
slash n the talk will be given by

159
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
muhammad please the floor is yours

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
do you hear me

161
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,960
yes we can hear you and we can see your

162
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
screen yeah

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
can barely hear him can you speak up

164
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,880
louder or boost your volume

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,840
no we're getting quite a lot of feedback

166
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,240
[Music]

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,039
if you're using an external microphone i

168
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,720
believe you should

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
try something else

170
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,599
okay

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
manage his microphone but you really

181
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
should try a different microphone that

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
one just does not work

183
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,200

345
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
soon in singapore

346
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
in yes

347
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
soon yeah okay

348
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,399
thank you jim it wasn't it's quite

349
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
unfortunate that uh this could not this

350
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
event could not be held in person

351
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
but uh

352
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
hopefully in the future years will

353
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
things will be

354
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
back to normal or as close to normal as

355
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,399
they can be

356
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
and uh hopefully you're gonna have a

357
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,519
chance to

358
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,399
go to singapore next time

359
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
thank you

360
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
so

361
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,360
uh i also would like to use this

362
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
opportunity to

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
uh thank the ram session chairs uh

364
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
chichanok in kong

365
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,800
uh thank you a lot for you your work

366
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
since you're gonna have the the

367
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
concluding remarks that i will let you

368
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
perhaps would like to see a few words

369
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
already now or

370
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,880
later during the concluding remarks

371
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,880
i can say a few words i know thank you

372
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
very much for

373
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
giving us this opportunity to to share

374

working as the conference

382
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,880
virtual conference administrators

383
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
uh it has been uh great working with the

384
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,119
two of you

385
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,840
and you you have done a great work thank

a lot for your help

387
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,919
i don't know if you would like to say a

388
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,280
few words is up to you

389
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160

391
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
thanks that we get every time

392
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,479
all right thank you

393
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
and thank you kevin let's get back to

394
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
traveling

395
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
yes

396
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
so

397
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
with this this concludes

398
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
my talk on acknowledgements and uh

399
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,640
recalling the awards thank you everybody

400
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
thank you michens mohammed are you can

401
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
you try again

402
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
yeah how about my voice now

403
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,720
yes it's a little bit better

404
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
go ahead

405
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,720
okay thank you

406
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,840
all right uh sorry today and

407
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,799
uh so this is the third episode on the

408
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,600
technical source in cccy people

409
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
and just be able to recap of what we saw

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,220
in the last two episodes that was um

411
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,299
[Music]

412
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
confidential computing is neatly defined

413
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
there are all the technologies that you

414
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
should be disabled for instance

415
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,320
uh multi-party computation and motion

416
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
detection or not and has multiple

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,799
competing definitions

418
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,779
[Music]

419
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,149
[Music]

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,280
and what is more

421
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,640
interesting here is additional

422
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
perspective

423
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
is also a part of confidential

424
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
and on the second place that is um

425
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
completing definition of the terms that

426
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
is fiction and multi-party computation

427
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
you all know that

428
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
encryption is formally defined for

429
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,880
instance with that

430
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
as well as multi-party computation is

431
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
also defined

432
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,240
so what is maybe this privacy preserving

433
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
computation uh term

434
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
and what we see here

435
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,740
or what we

436
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,039
[Music]

437
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
a general um just like your competition

438
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
and it does not have a specific

439
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
um

440
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
uh meaning assigned to it or

441
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,600
and it can be perceived differently

442
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
let's say depending on the privacy goals

443
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,879
that you have functions as an

444
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,799
execution environments given by the

445
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,200
converging and it's like this so i

446
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,679
believe three parts of it an environment

447
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
that provides a level of issues with the

448
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,799
following properties the first one being

449
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
the data confidentiality

450
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,120
and uh unauthorized entities cannot view

451
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
data while it is

452
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
and i haven't read here the terms which

453
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
are quite big for instance a level of

454
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,720
assurance what is this level of

455
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,559
assurance how is it layered

456
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
unauthorized entities what exactly they

457
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,039
are and for instance data is

458
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
these three properties for instance are

459
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,360
also satisfied by the adjacent and hence

460
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
this definition does not immediately

461
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
characterize

462
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
and what we also claim is that this

463
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
security definition is incomplete

464
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
meaning that uh again from gas and

465
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
lender definition of security it should

466
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
have two perspectives two fundamental

467
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
points

468
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
um that is

469
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
from attacker's perspective perspective

470
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
what constitutes a successful attack

471
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
and secondly a threat model which is

472
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,280
completely missing in the 63.

473
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,080
um there are some rules like

474
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
environments which expanding it means

475
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,280
specific execution environment

476
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
environments and it's not used as a

477
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
synonym of what one might expect

478
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
and for instance here in the white paper

479
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
it seems together with the tvs and it's

480
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,960
not defined even in the references

481
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
and uh

482
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,039
one

483
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,880
theme specifically is hardware based

484
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,559
social execution environments as i

485
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
defined it as i described that in the

486
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
definition is dependent on

487
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
particular-based specification

488
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,840
environment so it's very important to

489
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,440
define what they are and contrast it

490
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
with this software virtualized

491
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
education environment however in the

492
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,000
white paper there is no clear definition

493
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,679
and from the figure we see that the

494
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,840
hardware preservation environment

495
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,520
has no overlap with the software

496
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,480
procedure environments which means that

497
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,240
both of these entities should have a

498
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,080
very clear definition

499
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
and um

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
they should be really described and it

501
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
has actually legal implications as well

502
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,120
as

503
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
uh technical implications meaning that

504
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
some of the proceed execution

505
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
environments can be

506
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,559
uh split out from the confidential

507
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,720
operating such as aws

508
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
so it really needs to be

509
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,039
defined what exactly this specification

510
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
is

511
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
these are the key references and thank

512
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
you very much for listening and i hope

513
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,200
to see you in the next

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,039
you muhammad and um with this uh we

515
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,080
