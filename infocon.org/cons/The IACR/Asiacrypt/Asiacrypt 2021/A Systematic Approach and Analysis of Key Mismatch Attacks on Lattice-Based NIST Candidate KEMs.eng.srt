00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,920
hello everyone my name is john xiohan

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,280
i'm one of the co-authors of the paper

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,559
the paper is a journal work with senior

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
dr cho dr pan doctor who and the doctor

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
beam

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,240
in our presentation

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,920
which includes six parts first of all

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
we'd like to introduce some backgrounds

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,199
to our work

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,720
as we know

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
the migration through pqc has begun

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,719
just on october 2021 nist and department

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,879
of homeland security

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
created a migration road mike preparing

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,800
for a transition to pqc

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,680
and the process is expected to be

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,199
competitive in 2013.

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,520
the current pqc standardization

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,800
conference

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
reached the third round

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
on the

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,640
families

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
the 90s based times have drawn

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
significant attention

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,280
and

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
and on the third round list

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
there are still five

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
out of nine candidates

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,479
in the 90s based clients

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
next we introduce the security

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
assumptions of aids

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
we can roughly divide the

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
security assumptions of lagging space

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
claims into two categories

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
the first is lwe values

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
including protocol

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,040
new hope

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,520
caibo and cyber

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
whose

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
security assumption is corresponding to

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
[Music]

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
lwe problem rlw problem

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,240
mlw problem and mlwr problem the second

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
category is introvert

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,320
and

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,878
it's including intro and intro prime

47
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
both of them are based on untrue

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
assumptions

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
for language-based times

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,360
there are two flavors indcp and d6 apkc

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
the ind cpa version can be transformed

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
into

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,800
imd6 version

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
using a fo transport

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
and for ndcpa version it does not deny

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,720
yours

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
so we want to ask a question what will

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,920
happen if a key is reduced in age

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
which is one of the goal of research in

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879
our paper

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
that is evaluate superior's resonance

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
of this candidate's

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
misused situation

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
secondly

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,840
to improve efficiency there are many

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,959
authenticated exchange

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,560
protocols

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
using cpe version

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,519
without eiffel transport

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
finally

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
the set channel information can be used

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
to mount

73
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
civil tax attacks

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
against the cpca secure ones

75
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
so the land owned research focusing on

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
cpa superior ones

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,680
against the kpo's attacks

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,879
important

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,599
and has been actively

80
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,360
studied

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
just in 2015 couple wood and all

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
proposed the method of previous attack

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,480
and the 2018 is a clear thing i hope

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,239
proposed the chemist match attacks idea

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
after that there are many key mismatched

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,560
attacks

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
on the laddies based cards

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,480
but

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
there is still an

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
open problem that is

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,319
can we find a unified method to evaluate

92
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
the careers resilience

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
of least candidates against

94
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,920
match attacks

95
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,120
to respond to the question we firstly

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
introduced our attacking model

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,080
in the following part

98
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,479
before it we recall the dv helmet

99
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,479
exchange protocol for study

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
the two parties in the communication

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,240
jointly

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
generate a sim session key and the ka is

103
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
equal to kb

104
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,320
and the

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
structure is symmetric

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
but on the

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
lightest based ph like k exchange

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
the k breaks through a using an

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
impression

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
mechanism

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
and which means that

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,759
one party needs to

113
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,039
send additional information to help

114
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
the other party

115
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,639
to agree on a sim session here

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,560
under the understanding

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
the difference between

118
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
tv hellmann protocol and the latest

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
based image-like key exchange protocol

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
they describe a framework of

121
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,680
cp secure kai

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
firstly the bob

123
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
sends a request to alice and alice

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,560
generates a public ppa and secret key

125
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
ice tea

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
next

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
she sends a

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
public kpa to bob and bob generates

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
shared kkb

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
for bob

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
cray

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
generates a public kpb and

133
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
civil texas ziba

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
and he

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
finally

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
he sends public kpb and simple text

137
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
saver to alice we notice light the c bar

138
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
is the additional

139
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
information that we mentioned earlier

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
finally for ali's encryption part

141
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,479
she uses the sacred key ice a to equip

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,199
the

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
text c bar and he

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,639
and

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,520
she can guess the thing session kka

146
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,639
after that we introduce our attacking

147
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,600
model

148
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
so otherwise we impersonate

149
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,800
the ball

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
and he sends a request to alice and

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
ali's

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,680
key generations part behaves normally

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,840
we know the slides the is decryption

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,720
parts

155
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
and regeneration parts

156
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
public kpa and the secretary ice a

157
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
is released

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
and

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
next

160
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
she sends her public epa to adversary

161
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
for adversary

162
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,639
she

163
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,240
he generates a shared kkk and he

164
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
deliberately cites the public kpb and

165
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,240
the civil taxes cba

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,919
instead of

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,880
randomly generated

168
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
finally he

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
sends the public kpb civil tax c bar and

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
the strategy

171
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
kb together to alice

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
the oracle simulates the artist

173
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
equilibration parts

174
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
and he guides the

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
cherokee ka and the return one beast to

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,039
adversary by comparing

177
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,400
whether the

178
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,560
ka is equal to kb or not

179
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,560
an anniversary will repeat the process

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
until he collects enough information

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,840
and to cover the alice secretly

182
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
in case mitch attacks

183
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,120
the precondition of attacking is

184
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
anti-security and publicly

185
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,840
reduced

186
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,479
adversary wants to recover any secret

187
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,280
key

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
by comparing whether showcase match or

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
not

190
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
if the k is equal to kb which means

191
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
match otherwise which means mismatch

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
and in the following part we introduce

193
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,679
our basic idea

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
now we can

195
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
respond to a previous problem

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
that is yes in the remaining parts we

197
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,640
describe our method in detail

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
firstly we introduce some notations

199
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
recall that

200
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
the adversary recovers any security one

201
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
coefficient block by one calibration

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
block

203
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
one coefficient block is either one

204
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
coefficient or several coefficients of

205
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,440
security i say

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,080
and we introduce two sides the side ice

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
is in including all possible values for

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
one coefficient block

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
and

210
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,959
the

211
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,560
corresponding probability size is p 0 to

212
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
p n minus 1

213
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
which is in the deciding order

214
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
the summation of

215
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
h is equal to 1.

216
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
thanks in our attacking we can notice

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,880
sites

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,080
the university will select parameters

219
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
and

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
access to

221
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
oracle

222
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
finally he

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,440
collects a series of 0 and 1 values

224
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,640
for adversary he wants to ask question

225
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
how to recognize security assad with the

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
fewest number of euros

227
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,680
the problem can be transformed into a

228
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
coding problem

229
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
which is practically solved by

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,440
constructing a general

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
recovery tree

232
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,279
and we can

233
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,079
use the formula in the top of slides

234
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
to calculate the average number of euros

235
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,480
but

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
there are many binary recovery trees in

237
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
practical attacks

238
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
and we need to find an

239
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,480
optimal binary currency

240
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
but we all know or method a using

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
hofmann encoding

242
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,160
so our basic idea is using carbon coding

243
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,560
to get the low bound of average number

244
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
of curves

245
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
that is mean

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
yes

247
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,959
next we introduce the huffman coding

248
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,440
the basic idea of human coding is

249
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
contain two symbols to raise the lowest

250
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
probabilities

251
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,720
in each step

252
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,839
we give an example as the side eyes

253
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,399
consuming light is equal to

254
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,160
zero one minus one two minus two

255
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
and its corresponding side is

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
in the right side

257
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
the first type

258
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,399
we need to find the two

259
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
lowest probabilities nodes

260
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
that is two and minus two

261
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,360
and we can get a new node

262
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
and its corresponding probability is

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
0.125

264
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
the second step is

265
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
that we need to

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,399
combine the new node and node minus one

267
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
and we can get a

268
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,560
another new nodes

269
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,800
by repeating the process

270
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
we can collect a

271
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
huffman tree

272
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
using the hormone coding

273
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,600
we propose a serum one to prove our low

274
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
bounds previously

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,600
and

276
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
general entropy and the craft equality

277
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
will be used in it

278
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,079
and

279
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
from our perspective

280
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
we can use the

281
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,479
huffman coding's probability to get it

282
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,200
next we can give an example to

283
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
illustrate our low bounds for camera 10

284
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
to default

285
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
in 2024

286
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,760
twin uniform

287
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
the secret key i say is sampled from

288
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,200
centered binomial distribution

289
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
and the range of the security isa

290
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,200
is from -2 to 2.

291
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
we can get the minimums the is equal to

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
2.

293
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,399
125

294
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,040
and the channel entropy is equal to

295
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,839
2.03

296
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,680
which is consistent with crm1

297
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
and we can guess the low bank for

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
capital 1024

299
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,079
is

300
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,680
equal to

301
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,729
[Music]

302
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,519
2176 the detailed process for

303
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,160
constructing the

304
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
supplement tree for cover 10 24 is in

305
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,639
the figure

306
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
they can summarize it in one

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,680
seconds resize in each style we

308
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
select two nodes with the noise

309
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,000
probabilities to get a new node

310
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
using the huffman encoding we can get

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
other

312
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
robots for other kinds

313
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
and we list the detailed results in the

314
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
table

315
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
in the fourth part we propose our

316
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,040
improved practical attacks

317
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,839
we need to point likes

318
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,959
for some times there is still a huge guy

319

between existing tax

320
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,839
and low balance

321
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,800
such as lighter civil and frodo 640.

322
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
the guy is

323
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800

respectively

329
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
in the following parts we will show that

330
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
how to use the hoffman dream guide us to

331
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,279
improve this attacks

332
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,040
our input practical text is based on

333
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,240
husbandry

334
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
which includes two phases

335
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
interface one pre-computation base

336
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
the anniversary will

337
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,360
construct a binary recovery tree

338
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,240
in the recovery phase we will determine

339
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,519
the secret key according to the binary

340
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
trinity

341
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
for pre-computation base

342
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,199
the adversary wants to construct the

343
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,479
binary carry trinity

344
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
there is a relationship between our

345
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
attacking model and the final recovery

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,240
kit

347
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
in the faker

348
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,880
the lyft knows stone all the possible

349
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
secret key

350
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,279
and the non-leaf nodes from

351
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
the attacking parameters

352
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,839
that adversary accesses to oracle

353
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
for each non-leaf node

354
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
if oracle returns one it responds the

355
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,040
last three of the current nodes

356
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
and otherwise it corresponds to the

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
derived system

358
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
there is a detailed process of interface

359
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,279
on the second phase

360
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
it is recovery phase

361
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
the adversary will start from the roots

362
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,279
of the

363
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,680
annual recovery tree

364
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
and he selects parameters

365
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
in the nodes

366
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,800
and accesses to oracle

367
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
if oracle returns one he will continue

368
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
to access to the left submission of the

369
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
oracle

370
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,279
otherwise he

371
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,839
accesses to the right symmetry of the

372
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
oracle

373
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
he will repeat the process until the

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,199
current node is a leaf node

375
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,160
finally he can determine the security

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,719

377
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
there is still the detailed process of

a different h

397
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
according to the table

398
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,000

399
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
recovery tree in the right

400
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,400
we can give an example to its trigger

401
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
relationship between the table and the

the adversary first

selects the k2 is equal to 8

407
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
and other call will include 0

408
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,919
and he

409
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,840
continues to

select k3 is equal to nine

411
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
the oracle returns zero also

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,919
next the

finally

416
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,600
as the adversary can determine as a zero

417
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
is equal to

the other positions of the sql ki are

420
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,039
similar using the method on cyborg time

421
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,400
we can guide the results in the table

422

and as they can see the success rates

423
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
for our master is

424
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
100 percent of probably

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320

example on new hope 1024

427
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,440
our main idea is constructing a nearly

optimal binary search tree

429
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,760

00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
which needs to satisfy

431
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
a property

432
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,160
funny for each non-leaf nodes the

433
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
probability of left symmetry and random

434
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
tree should be as equal as possible and

435
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,120
the relationship between oracle returns

436
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
the value and the

437
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
leveraging of

438
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200

440
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,360
our attacking

on the north kind

442
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,799
and we can guess the results in the

table

444
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,440
the gap between our improved attacks and

the low bounce

446

[Music]

451
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
in the following patch we introduce our

452
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,720
improved channel attacks against ngcc

453
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
climbs

454
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
firstly we introduce

455
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
the royal echo's work

456
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
at the choice 2020 driving at all

457
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
propose a generic set channel attack on

458
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,679
60 single times in the cc circuit crimes

459
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
there is a iphone transport

460
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
which can reject miniature civil attacks

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,559
according to the mechanism of

462
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
re-infection

463
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
so our method cannot directly work on

464
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,240
each

465
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
but rari at all can use the set channel

466
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
information to bypass the actual

467
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
transform

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
make it possible taking the cc circuit

concepts of two stages

473
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,440
in the stage one they generate two

474
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,799
classes

480
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,400
in stage 2 they can collect a wave and

481
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,960
distinguish which class

482
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
w belongs to

483
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
we can see

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,919
the gamma 0 is consistent with mismatch

485
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,960
and

486
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
gamma 1 is consistently smashed so the

487
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
principle of their work

488
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,559

mismatch pack

490
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,640
so we can use our method in half of

for frodo

527
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
640 and length silver we can reduce the

528
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
number of euros is

529
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
by

530
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
71.99

531
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,879
and 27.93

532
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
respectively

533
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
the final we conclude our

534
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
work first

535
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,200
we get low bounce for 90s based times

536
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,159
off

537
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
and we propose our

538
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,080
binary currency method to optimize

539
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,960
circuits hashtags against the

540
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,679
lmd cpu circuit types

541
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
furthermore we can use our method in

542
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,880
half of

543
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,000
the channel tags to optimize the cell

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,840
channel tags against the ndcca circuit

545
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,880
cards here are some references in our

546
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679
presentation

547
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,600
that's all thank you
