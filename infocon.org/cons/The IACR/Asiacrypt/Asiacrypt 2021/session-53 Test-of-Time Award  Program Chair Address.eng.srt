1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,599
you're ready to go

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,639
all right

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,960
so welcome everyone

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
uh for the test award test of time award

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,599
ceremony

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
of asia group 2021

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,199
so the test of time award

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
of the iacr

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
is given yearly for each one of the

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
three iacr general conferences so one

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
for your crypt one for crypto and one

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
for azure crypt

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
uh and it's given for a paper that has

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,000
had a lasting lasting impact in the on

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
the field

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
so

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
uh we the eligible papers are

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,559
asian group from the papers from the

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,160
same conference

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,719
15 years earlier so

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,680
this year eligible papers for asia crypt

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,640
where

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
the papers

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,079
of azure crypt 20 2006

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
uh and we chose among all of all those

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,239
papers

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
um one which had a particularly lasting

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,080
impact

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,760
uh on

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
the overall field of cryptography so the

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
selection is done uh by a committee uh

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,759
that that changes each year

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,840
consisting of two members

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
uh appointed by the board of directors

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
of the icr as well as one representative

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
one of the program co-chairs from each

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,040
of the three conferences

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
so this year the the the

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,840
selection committee chair was willie

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,960
maurer uh together with nigel smart uh

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,280
as appointed by the board

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
and um francois xavier standard for your

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
crypts uh chris spiker

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,000
for uh crypto and myself for asia crypt

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
um so submissions for next year are open

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,759
so nigel put

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
a link so

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
if you want to nominate a paper to from

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,440
2007 you are you are free to do so um at

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
the the link he uh put on the chat

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
um

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
and so okay so

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
um so

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
as as i said we

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,959
um

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
uh closed so you can nominate papers we

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
closed nominations

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
um

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
in uh in february

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
um

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
so but we we didn't we weren't limited

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
to nomination so we can choose

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
ourselves and in this case it was

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
important because we actually received a

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
very small number of nominations but

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
anyway so we looked at all the papers

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
and decided on the most impactful ones

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,879
and

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
we selected um

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
uh in this case

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
um

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
uh a paper by um jen scott uh from asia

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
group 2006 uh titled uh simulation sound

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,280
music proofs

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
for practical language and constant

76
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,480
science group signature

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
and this paper was selected for

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,760
constructing asymptotically optimal

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
music proofs

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120
and group signatures without using

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
random oracles

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
and paving the way to practical

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
constructions so

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
congratulations jens

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
who is uh attending this session

86
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
um

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,159
thank you maddie

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,720
congratulations

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
okay um yeah if i can say a few words um

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
so so this is um

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,480
work that i did when i was a postdoc at

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
ucla so i would thank um it's a high

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
rather stropski for hosting me and it

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
was a very productive time so we had

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
several papers on how to do

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,200
non-interactive zero knowledge based on

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
uh pairings

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
um and and this particular paper i also

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
want to thank the selection committee

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
for for digging it out because there

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
were several papers we wrote and i guess

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
this one slipped a little under the

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
radar but it's actually a paper that's

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
really close to my heart so i'm very

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
happy that the selection committee kind

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
of found this

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,959
paper and gave me the award for this

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,000
paper

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
um

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
so so the history is that uh at that

111
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
time we saw like figured out how to do

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
non-interactive zero knowledge

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
for pairings and and to start with that

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,560
was for like on a on a gate by gate

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
basis bit by bit basis

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
um

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
but what you really want is efficient

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,600
zero knowledge right and if you're

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
paying the overhead for doing improving

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
things gate by gate or bit by bit then

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
that's very expensive

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,080
so so the purpose of this paper is to to

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,320
show that you can really do

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,520
non-interactive knowledge directly for a

125
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
language which is practical which has

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
direct makes direct sense in a

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
cryptographic scheme

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,840
and the particular cryptographic scheme

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
was group signatures

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,199
um

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,400
so so

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
with these new non-interactive knowledge

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
techniques based on pairings and you can

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,960
now prove directly things about group

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
elements that you know you're doing an

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
exponentiation you're multiplying a

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
couple of field elements and and things

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
like that

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
um and that allowed you to do group

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,199
signatures

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
with so like non-interactive zero

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
knowledge proofs but then what not based

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
on the random oracle but so like

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
standard uh

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,440
model

146
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
um and which had a constant number of

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
group elements it was a huge constant

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,759
and it has been improved since uh i

149
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,199
think we're talking about hundreds of

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
thousands of group dollars but it was a

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,080
constant so it was so like a language

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,360
which was uh

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
practical it really has like the kind of

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,919
things you want to prove directly right

155
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
but it was a theoretical practical

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
result so to speak um

157
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
i want to note that uh i was not the

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
only one noticing this so there were

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,759
also in parallel uh works by uh brent

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,960
waters and javier yen that also did

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
group signatures and also had some

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
interesting results with the constant

163
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
size group signatures

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
and at the same time and so might also

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
have some discussions with with brent

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,919
about that but back in those days

167
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
so but um yeah thanks very much i'm very

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,400
honored and very happy to receive the

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
test of time away

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
okay congratulations again

171
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
um

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
if there are any comments please speak

173
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,199

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
yeah okay so so this is the report from

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
the

202
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
program chairs so

203
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,879
uh hwai wong and myself

204
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
um about uh

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
the organization the scientific

206
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
organization of airscript

207
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,680
so

208
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
some highlights

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
we had the most submissions ever

210
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,440
341

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
and also the most

212
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
accepted papers

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
and i believe

214
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,199
we also have one of the mo the top

215
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
numbers of registrations

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
uh for asia crypt maybe uh last year was

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,599
was more

218
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,279
um although in practice because of um

219
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
um of

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
virtual or

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
organizations in practice uh we we

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
noticed that the attendance in sessions

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
is not actually breaking records um

224
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
so hopefully we we will soon go back to

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
um

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
like at least hybrid organizations that

227
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,240
uh

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
um people can um participate in person

229
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,080
and uh have devote their

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
attention to the to the to the

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
conference without

232
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,720
having uh meetings all day

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
that disturb them

234
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
um

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
so one change

236
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
we decided to make is to have a larger

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,519
program committee

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
so since we accepted we were expecting a

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
relatively large number of submissions

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
and

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and from maybe a

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
um a broader

243
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
um

244
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
set of area areas

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
we wanted to broaden also the expertise

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
of the of the pc so

247
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
we invited more members to pc than usual

248
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
so we assembled a pc

249
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
um of 74 members

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
which was uh i believe fairly diverse in

251
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,399
terms of

252
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,760
expertise

253
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
academic seniority and geographic

254
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
geographical location and and to some

255
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
extent

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
as we could gender

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,959
so

258
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
um so this this this larger pc allows us

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
allowed us to

260
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
assign

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000
uh smaller than usual number of reviews

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,200
to pc members so each got each one got

263
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
15 reviews

264
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
um which some

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
of which they could um

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
um

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,839
uh

268
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
delegate some uh to external reviewers

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
so we got the help

270
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,240
of uh almost 400 external reviewers who

271
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
contributed to the review process

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
so

273
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,399
that's a

274
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
bird's-eye view of what the the program

275
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
committee looked like so

276
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
in terms of gender we had

277
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,240
we were um

278
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,000
72 percent mail

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
uh in terms of uh geographical location

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,399
we had uh 14 uh percent

281
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,279
uh

282
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,000
in

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,079
um americas so mostly us and canada but

284
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,120
also some

285
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
uh latin american countries

286
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,240
and

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
um

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
43 percent each of europe and the asia

289
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,120
pacific region

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,079
so um

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,800
like in terms of location as well

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
um the the program committee was

293
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
relatively diverse

294
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
so

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
how the review process went um

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
so we as i said we had the 341

297
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
submissions not counting duplicates or

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
invalid submissions

299
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,279
um actually we

300
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,480
oh sorry

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
um that was a typo here so we had 200

302
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,959
something submissions so okay so

303
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,839
um so the the review process as usual

304
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
for icr conferences was to stage so with

305
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
a rebuttal phase

306
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
and so we decided also to have early

307
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
rejection so papers that um

308
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
really didn't seem to have any chance of

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,160
getting accepted um

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
after the initial review round uh where

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
received an early rejection decision so

312
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
this this was um about 100 papers so 200

313
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
something and i think it was 263

314
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,360
something like this submissions advanced

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
to the second round

316
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
and 95

317
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
were eventually accepted

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
so

319
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
some

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
got minor revisions and after

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,120
the the pc could check that the

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
revisions were implemented

323
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
um they were officially accepted to the

324
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,320
conference and this this gave

325
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
so 27.9 acceptance rate so we are one

326
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,959
percent up

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
from last year

328
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
um

329
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,200
so as a rule uh submissions received at

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
least three reviews and at least five uh

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
four papers that were co-authored by a

332
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
pc member

333
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,639
so

334
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
unfortunately there were on a handful

335
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
of papers that received less

336
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
reviews um almost always due to

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
coverage related difficulties on the

338
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
part of the reviewers and so um we

339
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
apology

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
we apologize to the authors of those

341
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
submissions uh for

342
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
um not being able to find um reviewers

343
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,639
on time for their submissions

344
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
and so as usual so pc members were

345
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,079
allowed to submit up to two papers and

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,120
one

347
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
if the paper was single author

348
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
um so we had

349
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
we put together um unfortunately i

350
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
believe a great program

351
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
uh that consisted of uh

352
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,639
andrew yao's uh distinguished lecturer

353
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,090
yesterday two invited talks so um

354
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,440
[Music]

355
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
casually sacco

356
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,079
a couple of hours ago and you

357
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,638
tomorrow

358
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,839
so

359
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,920
the pape

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,120
we decided for the first time for an icr

361
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
um virtual conference to have parallel

362
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
tracks

363
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
um

364
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,040
so

365
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,199
the 16 technical sessions were divided

366
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
in in those parallel tracks

367
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,680
with short life talks and q a so

368
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,399
about five minutes for each talk

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
and you have longer talks on youtube

370
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
so

371
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
we didn't yet receive specific feedback

372
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,880
but

373
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,959
my impression is that this uh parallel

374
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
track format uh is working pretty well

375
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
so um

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,199
please let us know if you if you like it

377
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
that way or um you prefer um

378
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,600
um single tracks even though and this

379
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
becomes um

380
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,360
a pretty long conference because of the

381
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
number of accepted papers

382
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,160
and so the the award paper

383
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,959
uh the award papers so

384
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
were presented on monday in a plenary

385
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
session so

386
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
they didn't get into parallel tracks

387
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
so you have one ramp session coming soon

388
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
uh right after this session

389
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,600
and um

390
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
there are there are three social

391
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
awareness in the program

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,120
uh including

393
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,199
language specific rooms

394
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,120
on we had one on monday and there's

395
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
going to be one

396
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,639
tomorrow as well

397
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,760
so

398
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
many thanks to the volunteers who

399
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
accepted to host those social hours

400
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
and this was organized by the general

401
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
chair uh by the basin idea

402
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,320
from

403
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
last year's asia crypt so i believe

404
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,839
that's the uh only

405
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,480
um uh

406
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
uh the only uh virtual conference where

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
we had we have those language specific

408
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
rooms so far

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
so some

410
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
silly statistics as usual so

411
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
this is the

412
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
um

413
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
the the

414
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,040
time of first submission of uh

415
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
of the the papers of the conference so

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
if you look at submitted papers you can

417
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
see that

418
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
we had

419
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,639
24 hours before the deadline we had

420
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,399
about

421
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
70

422
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,759
uh submissions

423
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,800
and this grow this grew to

424
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,079
340 within the last day

425
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,120
um

426
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
so the last uh the latest submitted

427
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,000
papers was actually six minutes after

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
the deadline because we decided to

429
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,600
um

430
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
especially because um there were there

431
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
was some confusion

432
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
about um

433
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
about um the fact that the

434
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
uh the the deadline was at noon utc

435
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,680
instead of midnight we we left a very

436
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
small

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,800
bit of slack

438
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,839
in in what how we accepted so

439
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
fortunately so we didn't have to accept

440
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
it so um

441
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,839
those there were actually three papers

442
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,000
that were submitted after the deadline

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
none of them actually got uh accepted

444
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,280
and the last latest accepted paper

445
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,679
though was submitted nine minutes uh

446
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
before the deadline

447
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,559
so

448
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,640
as you can see there's a

449
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
there's a small blip in the number of

450
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,359
accepted papers towards the end

451
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
even though um

452
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
actually most most of the papers

453
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
submitted very late

454
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,280
uh were not eventually accepted

455
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,960
so this is a wall cloud for the

456
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
submitted paper titles

457
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
so

458
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,840
we we thought that

459
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
new byzantine tests of fully linear

460
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
encryption was something representative

461
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,679
and then this is the accepted paper

462
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
titled work cloud so something like

463
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
tight security of universal quantum mpc

464
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,039
um so we'd like

465
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,160
to thank uh many people about this

466
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
