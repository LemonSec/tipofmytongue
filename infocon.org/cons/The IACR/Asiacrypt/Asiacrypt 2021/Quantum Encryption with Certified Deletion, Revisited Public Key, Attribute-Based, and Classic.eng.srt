00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,560
hello everyone my name is taiga hiroka

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
in this talk i talk about contaminant

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,519
encryption without admission represented

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,400
public key attribute-based and classical

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,679
communication

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,880
this work is going to work

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,119
first remy explains the prior work

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,640
secretary key encryption with

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
authorization was introduced by

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
broadband and islam

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
in tcc 2020

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,200
in this prim tip there is a thought

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,680
hydration security in addition to the

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
functionality of significant encryption

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
this content primitive works as horrors

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
first a sender generates a classical

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
secret key

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
then she generates a quantum ciphertext

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
and sends it to the receiver

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
if he receives a secret key

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,760
he can detect the ciphertext by running

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,680
a decoding algorithm on them

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
on the other hand

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
after she sends a quantum ciphertext she

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
can check whether he there is a quantum

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
cipher text correctly

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,799
if she wants to derive the quantum

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
psychotics she requests him till there

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
is a psychotics

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
after that she receives a classical

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
certificate which guarantees that

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
she deletes the ciphertext

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
then she checks whether this certificate

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
is correct or not using secret key

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,400
when correct even if he receives a

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
secret key

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,320
he cannot obtain the information message

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
m correctly

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,799
in gtb this is what certification

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
security guarantees

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,479
muah homari satellite duration security

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,960
is defined by the security game

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,159
between the challenger and adversary

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
first the challenger given the secret

45
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,399
key

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,119
anniversary generates two messages

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
and sends them to the challenger

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
the challenger decides bit b and

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
generates the ciphertext for the message

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,038
m b

51
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,800
and sends it to the adversary

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
the adversary generates a classical

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
certificate and sends it to the

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
challenger

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
the challenger runs verification

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,440
algorithm on them

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,959
and that puts top or about

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
the battery receives the secret key

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
and outputs b prime

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
we say that the encryption scheme is

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,400
that hydration secure if it satisfies

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
this inequality

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
where this stop means that the

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
challenger out could talk

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
this is what saturation security

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
guarantees

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
we mark that

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
this functionality is classically

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
impossible

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
in other words if the cipher attacks is

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
classical it cannot achieve such

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
hydration security

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
this is because adversary can copy the

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,679
classical ciphertext

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,040
they construct this prim tip using bb-84

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,920
states

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
for the ease of explanation i explain

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
the construction where the sender sends

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
only whole qubits

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,519
first season is a random classical bit

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
string as a secret key

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
after that she randomly generates a

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,840
computational basis quantum state as

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
horus

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
then

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
she operates at the mouth gate on them

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
according to this crosscarpet string

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,519
after that she encrypts the message n

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,480
using the information of bit values of

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
computation basis

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
state where

92
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,799
it is a hash function

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
and this cell corresponds to this zero

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
and this one corresponds to this one

95
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
are the quantum cipher texts of the

96
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,000
construction

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
then she sends them to the receiver

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
we remark that if the receiver has a

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
secret key

100
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
he can obtain the message m correctly

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,918
this is because the secret key is

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,478
information of basis of these quantum

103
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
states

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
therefore he can obtain 0 and 1 by

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
measuring these quantum states in the

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
computational basis

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
but he can decrypt m by computing h of

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
zero and one

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
on the other hand if she changes her

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
mind and the there is a cipher takes c

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
request to him to measure all these

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
quantum states in damage basis

113
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
the next receiver measures all these

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
quantum states in the domain basis and

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,759
obtains the cross-cut bit string

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
where rr random classical bit

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
then the receiver sends them to the

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
sender

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
then she checks whether this certificate

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
is correct or not using secret key

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
when this certificate is correct even if

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
he receives a secret key

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
he cannot obtain the message m correctly

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
this is because he has to measure all

125
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
these quantum states in the normal basis

126
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,320
in order to make her accept with the

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,919
high probability

128
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,800
since even the unbounded malicious

129
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
receiver cannot distinguish the basis of

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
these quantum states if he measures the

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
computational basis state in the demand

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
basis

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
this quantum state collapses to the

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
random classical bit and he can no

135
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
longer obtain the bit values of

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,840
computation basis state

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
their construction has disadvantages as

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
horrors

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
first their construction is limited to

140
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
the setting of one time secret game

141
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
encryption

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,080
which means that one needs a same secret

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,039
key to run the encounter with algorithm

144
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,600
and to run the decoding algorithm

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,479
and the key cannot be reused

146
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,160
it is problematic in some cases

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
second in the construction

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,319
the sender needs quantum operations

149
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
third in the construction duration is

150
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
privately believable

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
which means that the sender needs a

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
verification key kept secret

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,199
in their construction

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
if the verification key is revealed the

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,039
merchant's receiver can obtain both the

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
correct certificate

157
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
and the message

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
in our work we have improved these

159
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
disadvantages

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,880
as horrors

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
more homely results of our work are the

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,160
followings

163
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
first we have constructed public

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,120
encryption without hydration from

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
industry secure public encryption and

166
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
one-time secretary encryption without

167
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
violation

168
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
second we have constructed

169
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
attribute-based encryption with

170
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,199
satellite vision

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,280
assuming the existence of post-quantum

172
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,800
indistinguishability obviation

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
and one-way function

174
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
and one-time secret communication with

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,440
certification

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,919
third we have constructed public

177
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,800
encryption without hydration that uses

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
only classical communication

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,599
this is constructed from industrial

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,759
secure public encryption and the

181
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
assumption that running with errors

182
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
problem cannot be solved efficiently by

183
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
a quantum computer

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,240
this construction is secure in the

185
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,080
contaminated model

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
course we have constructed public

187
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
encryption with publicly buildable

188
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
satisfaction

189
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,879
that uses only classical communication

190
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
this is constructed from one shot

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
signature and extractable witness

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
encryption

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,759
but for the time constraints in this

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,120
talk i talk about this

195
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
and this

196
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,160
first i talk about public encryption

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
with such hydration

198
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
we have constructed public encryption

199
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
with satellite duration using public key

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
encryption and secret key encryption

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,879
with statistics as a building block in a

202
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,640
black spokes way

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
but for the ease of explanation i will

204
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
explain specific construction

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,799
idea of our construction is very

206
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,080
standard

207
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
to encrypt the secret key

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
using

209
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
public key encryption

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
first

211
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,920
a sender receives a public key

212
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,760
and generates a secret key

213
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,519
which is same as this secret key

214
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,160
then using this secret key she generates

215
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,279
a quantum ciphertext

216
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,240
at the same time she also encrypts this

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
secret key using public encryption

218
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
these are the ciphertexts of a

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
construction

220
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,839
then she sends them to the

221
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
receiver note that at this point if the

222
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,760
receiver has or obtained the secret key

223
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
he can't get the message n correctly

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
this can be done by decrypting this

225
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,720
ciphertext using secret key or public

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
key encryption

227
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
and using this secret key on this cipher

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,399
text he can put a message m correctly

229
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
on the other hand if she changes her

230
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
mind and wants to drill the ciphertext

231
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
she requests to him to there is a

232
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
quantum ciphertext

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
and she receives a classical certificate

234
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,560
which guarantees that the receiver needs

235
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
a ciphertext

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
then the sender checks whether this

237
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
certificate is correct or not using this

238
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
secret key

239
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
when the certificate is correct

240
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,279
even if he receives a secret key of

241
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
public encryption

242
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
he got obtained the message aimed

243
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
correctly

244
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
i explained the injected proof

245
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,320
because the secretary of state

246
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
encryption with such hydration is

247
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
encrypted by public encryption

248
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,440
this ciphertext uses for the receiver

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
therefore in order to make her accept

250
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
with a high probability with a high

251
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,600
probability

252
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
the receiver has to measure all these

253
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
quantum states in the demand basis

254
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
on the other hand once he measures the

255
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
computational basis state in that mod

256
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
basis he cannot obtain the beat barriers

257
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
of computational basis state

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,440
even if he receives a secret key on

259
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
public encryption after he met this

260
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,399
quantum state

261
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,560
therefore our construction is also

262
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
secure

263
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,399
this is an intuitive understanding of

264
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
our security

265
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
but for the homework proof we have to

266
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
construct a protocol

267
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
using receiver non-committing encryption

268
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
instead of public encryption

269
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
technically this is the most important

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,839
for work of public encryption without

271
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,360
hydration but for the ease of

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
explanation i skipped the whole proof

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,079
if you are interested in the hormone

274
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,160
proof please read our paper

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
now i finish the first part

276
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
then eyes are the second part there is

277
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,920
saturation with classical communication

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
in the third hydration explained so far

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
the sender needs quantum operations

280
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,240
in this work

281
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
we have improved the disadvantage and

282
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
have constructed certification that uses

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
only classical communication

284
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
in this work we have used noisy traffic

285
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
quality functions f and injective

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
trapped function d and public encryption

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
to construct a protocol

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
these functions are constructed from

289
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
reliable assumption and have some

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
cryptographic properties

291
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
using these properties a classical

292
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
sender can generate a quantum state in a

293
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
receiver's register

294
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
in another shell

295
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,040
idea of a construction is to use f-type

296
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,160
function

297
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
and g-type function

298
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
instead of directly sending

299
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
deviator states with quantum channel

300
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,519
first i explain how to use

301
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,639
nodegeotropically functions f to

302
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,079
generate a quantum state

303
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,720
a classical sender fast generator

304
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
trapdoor and noisy dropped across the

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,040
functions f and sends it to receiver

306
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
then the receiver generates a

307
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
superposition state and coherently

308
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
evaluates echo bags

309
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
since noisy drop to quality functions f

310
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
is 2 to 1

311
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
if he measures the third register in the

312
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
computational basis he obtains this

313
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,040
quantum state

314
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
where f of 0x0 and a hover one x1 as

315
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600
measurement outcome y

316
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
if he measures this quantum state in the

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
computational basis this quantum state

318
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
collapses to the classical bit string

319
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
0x0 or 1x1

320
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,120
on the other hand if he measures this

321
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
quantum state in the demand basis this

322
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,079
quantum state crosses

323
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,959
to random classical bit string e and d

324
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
where e and d satisfies the following

325
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
equation

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
intuitively

327
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
once the receiver measures this quantum

328
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
state in the computational basis the

329
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,000
quantum state crosses to zero or zero

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
zero or one x one

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,040
therefore he can no longer obtain e and

332
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
d that satisfies this equation

333
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
this intuitive is formulated as adaptive

334
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,760
hydrocarbite property

335
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
which guarantees that the quantum

336
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
polynomial time receiver cannot obtain

337
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:16,959
both

338
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,920
this

339
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
and this at the same time with a

340
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
probability more than one half

341
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
and the adaptive helicopter property can

342
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,800
be amplified as proven in these papers

343
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,760
next i explain how to use injective

344
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,120
traptor function d

345
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,880
injective trapped function g is

346
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
constructed from readable assumption and

347
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,199
has some cryptographic properties

348
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,240
write knowledge of docu functions f

349
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
a classical sender candidate quantum

350
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
state in the receiver's register

351
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
first

352
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
the classical standard in

353
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
and function g and sends it to the

354
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,839
receiver

355
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
note that from the property of injective

356
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
invariance of the function g

357
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
the quantum polynomial time receiver

358
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
cannot distinguish

359
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
the function g from function f

360
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,240
this property is very important for

361
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
construction of sate hydration

362
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,480
and then

363
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,120
he generates a superposition state

364
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
and coherently evaluates g of x

365
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
since a function g is injected if he

366
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
measures the third register in the

367
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
computational basis

368
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
the sender obtains this quantum state

369
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,680
where g of b and x is equal to

370
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,399
measurement outcome y

371
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,959
if he measures the quantum state in the

372
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
computational basis this quantum state

373
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
corrupts this to the classical big

374
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
string b and x

375
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
on the other hand if he measures this

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,040
quantum state in the damage basis

377
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,600
then this quantum state prophecies to

378
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,279
the random classical bitching r

379
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,759
now i will explain our construction

380
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,800
again

381
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
in another shell idea of a construction

382
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
is to generate quantum state using

383
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,279
f-type functions and g-type functions

384
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,639
instead of

385
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,360
directly sending bb-8 whole states with

386
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,079
quantum channel

387
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,720
our construction is as well

388
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
first a classical sender receives public

389
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,199
key

390
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,279
and then generates a classical bit

391
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,399
string

392
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,279
where zero denotes the g-type function

393
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
and one denotes the f-type function

394
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
next she generates g-type functions and

395
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,800
f-type functions according to this

396
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,519
classical bit string

397
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,920
at the same time the sender generates a

398
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
trapdoor

399
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
now she sends the functions to the

400
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
receiver

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,639
the receiver receives the functions and

402
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
generates these quantum states in his

403
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
register

404
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
remember that in order to generate these

405
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,039
quantum states the receiver measures a

406
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
third register in the computational

407
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,799
basis

408
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,720
the receiver sends the measurement

409
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,319
outcomes to the sender

410
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
at this point she can know the post

411
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,439
measurement content state

412
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,240
using top door

413
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
on the other hand the receiver does not

414
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
know the post measurement quantum states

415
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,000
therefore this process is as if c

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
primary generates the quantum state

417
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
in the receiver's register without

418
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,360
quantum channel

419
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
then she can enter the message m

420
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,160
using the increments of b1 and x1

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
as horrors

422
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
where h is a hash function there is

423
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,679
other quantum random oracle

424
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,000
at the same time she increased the

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
location of functions using

426
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,280
the public key

427
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
then sends them to the receiver

428
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
these are the ciphertexts of our

429
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
construction

430
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
now

431
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
i check a construction satisfies the

432
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
correctness

433
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
if the receiver has a secret key

434
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,760
he jump the location function by using

435
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
this secret key

436
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
and this ciphertext this ciphertext

437
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
by measuring this content state in the

438
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
computational basis he jumped a v1 x1

439
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,799
correctly

440
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,080
therefore he jumped in m by computing h

441
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
of b1 x1

442
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,000
then

443
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,240
explain how the deletion algorithm works

444
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,039
after she sends the ciphertext

445
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,440
if she changes her mind and wants to

446
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,799
delete the ciphertext syllabus receiver

447
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,600
to measure all these quantum states in

448
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,840
the damage basis

449
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,640
and send the measurement outcomes to the

450
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
sender

451
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,440
where r is a random classical a bit

452
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,919
and each e and d satisfies the following

453
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,320
equation

454
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,840
and then she checks whether each end

455
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,480
satisfies this occasion using drop door

456
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,679
when yes

457
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
even if he receives a secret key on

458
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
public encryption

459
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
he cannot obtain the information message

460
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,480
m correctly

461
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,360
now i will explain intuitive proof of

462
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
our security

463
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,080
in our work to improve the security we

464
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
have introduced a new property of the

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,120
noisy drop tropical functions which we

466
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
call the

467
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
carton cheese adaptive hardcore property

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,480
intuitively catalan cheese adaptive

469
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
hardcore core property guarantees that

470
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
the content polynomial time receiver

471
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
cannot obtain

472
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,960
this that satisfy this occasion and this

473
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
at the same time

474
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
if you admit the captain to adaptive

475
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,520
hardcore property we can prove the

476
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
security of our construction in the

477
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
quantum random oracle model

478
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,240
because this cipher text is encrypted

479
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
using public encryption

480
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,880
this is useless for the adversary

481
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,840
on the other hand from the content is

482
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,120
satisfies this in this equation

483
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,039
he cannot obtain b1 and x1

484
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,000
because

485
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,799
h

486
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,320
is random moroccan

487
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,280
if he cannot obtain v1 and x1

488
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
he cannot obtain the information of

489
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
plaintext m

490
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
therefore a construction is secure if

491
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
you admit the carton choose adaptive

492
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
hardcore property

493
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
finally i will explain the intuitive

494
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,000
reason why our cartoon choose adaptive

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,679
hardcore property holds

496
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
in order to obtain emd

497
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
that satisfy this occasion he has to

498
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,559
measure these two quantum states in the

499
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,880
demand basis

500
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
on the other hand he cannot distinguish

501
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,520
these quantum states from this quantum

502
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
state

503
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,159
therefore in order to obtain this ent

504
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
he needs to measure all these quantum

505
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,120
states in the normal basis

506
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
on the other hand

507
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
if he measures this quantum state in the

508
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,520
normal basis this quantum state

509
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
collapses to the random classical bit

510
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
string

511
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
therefore he can no longer obtain b1 and

512
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
x1

513
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
this is an intuitive proof of our

514
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,919
capital and choose adaptive hardcore

515
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,919
property

516
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,159
in this talk i explained an intuitive

517
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,880
understanding of our results by showing

518
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
the concrete construction without

519
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
details

520
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,880
if you are interested in more formal

521
