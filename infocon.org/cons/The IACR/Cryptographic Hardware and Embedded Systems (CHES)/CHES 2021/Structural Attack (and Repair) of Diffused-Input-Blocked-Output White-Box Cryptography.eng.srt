00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome to this uh chess

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,399
[Music]

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,000
2021 presentation with respect to

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,920
structural attacks

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
and the repair

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
of the diffused input blocked output

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
white box photography

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,960
this is a joint work with the claude

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
carla and cm energy

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,119
i'm silvagier i'm very glad to

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,080
explain you actually our findings first

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,079
of all i will

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,160
give a little background about white box

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,600
cryptography

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,280
wbc

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
then

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
actually i'll present

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,559
our use case

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
that of the lisbo diffuse input blocked

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
output

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,079
then i show that

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
it can happen that

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
this scheme is broken

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
so i'll

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
talk about the distinguishers

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
on the case of the advanced encryption

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,399
standard okay the aes

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
what's new is that i will give a formal

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
mathematical proof of the crypto

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,200
analysis

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
which will

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,159
allows me to

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
explain

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,720
why

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,799
debo can sometimes be broken

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
and actually i will derive from the

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
proof a way to repair the bow okay so

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,079
debo is still

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,119
alive

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,520
provided some

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,400
provisions are taken with respect to

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
this white box crypto scheme okay then i

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,360
i conclude

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
so

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,399
whitebox crypto it's like you use

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,759
a

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,040
aes

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
as a

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
public key scheme so

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
you will

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
hide the key k-star

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
into a kind of a

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
tabular

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
implementation

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
and so a client can encrypt without

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
knowing knowing the key

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,840
that the server knows the key and so it

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,879
can decrypt and recover uh what was sent

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
by the the client okay there are use

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
cases in the hostcard emulation

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
drm okay and you know the state of the

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
art about

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,319
show

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,720
and this is called source

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
there are plenty of attacks uh

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
statistical attacks

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
attacks

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,760
leveraging

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
the

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
gray box analysis like the differential

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
computation analysis uh for instance

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
and those which rely on the fourier

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
transform okay

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
the attack i will describe is uh of the

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
third

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
kind

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
and

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
is actually an improvement on that of

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
pascal sastrich amir moradi and tim

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
right

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
so what is debo

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
okay let's consider

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
the first operation in an a in yes so

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
it's a t-box which is a composition of

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
the s-box and a part of the mixed

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
columns operation

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,959
and

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,360
so we aim at hiding

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
this t-box with a random ejections

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
we have a linear permutation phi

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
and a blocked projection b okay this

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
mimics

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
a simple

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,200
structure of a block cipher

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,239
with a

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,720
diffusion in phi and confusion in b

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,159
in details you see so we stack on top of

98
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
the functional

99
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,120
operation here the t box okay which is

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
concealing the

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
key addition here

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,439
so we have this linear operation file

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
which is taken

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,239
which takes sorry 32 bits and the maps

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
it to 32-bit it must be invertible

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
because obviously in the rest of the

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,720
computation we need to

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
peel

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
this operation

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
and so we have the nonlinear parts

111
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
which

112
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
are the concatenation of

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,959
four

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,639
ejections

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
one byte one byte

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,360
again they must be invertible

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
and why are they like that in four

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
blocks that's because the subsequent

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
operations will need to manipulate some

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
some bytes okay so those operations b1

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
b2 b3 b4 needs to be inverted somehow in

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
the rest of the

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
computation okay

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
so now you you

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
compose all that

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
and you end up with a table which is 8

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
to 32 bits and everything is

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,479
so

129
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,440
evaluated in there and

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,639
imagine the entropy of all those phi and

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,840
b which is huge compared to only the

132
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,600
256 values which are possible for the

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
key

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
so you know

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
apparently this looks extremely strong

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
okay

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
so i will show that

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
in more than 99 of the cases this

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
construction can be broken actually and

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
we can extract k-star

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
so how does um

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
attacks

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
work actually so

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
the idea is pretty simple for all key

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
hypotheses

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
like k

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
we peel

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
so from the obfuscated function we we

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
peel the functional part

150
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
and so we aim to check whether it is

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
looking like a debuff okay

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
so instead of you know uh the input

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
taking the input as a

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
as a

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
y which is the the image under the mixed

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
columns we can just you know provide

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
directly uh a byte here

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,840
and

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,319
map it to the image of the the mixed

160
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,520
columns okay so in which case actually

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
uh the function we need to

162
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,280
to

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
assess

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
becomes

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
kind of clear because you see um so we

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
explicitly

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
the the difference between the key guess

168
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
and the correct key appears

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
and so if if it is a

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
good guess there will be a

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
simplification let me show it

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
through a diagram when we have the good

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
key

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
so we manage to basically peel uh

175
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,840
properly so the the t-box okay so we are

176
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
just

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
left with

178
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,759
the linear part here of the mixed

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,960
columns

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
and

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
then the depot okay phi and b here

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,639
whereas for the incorrect key guess we

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,360
get

184
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
you know

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
an amount of different things and so you

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
know we have this c which is non-zero

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,840
which is the difference between the keys

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
and which is adding a lot of complex

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
functions on top of

190
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
the objective table okay

191
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
which is

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,160
which is over there okay

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
and so for this reason

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,960
so

195
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
the the test

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
of the crypto analysis is to distinguish

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
between a debo

198
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
and the non-deborah would say okay

199
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
so in the rest of the talk uh the the

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
the good situation will be in

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,199
green and the bad one in the head all

202
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
right

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
notice that

204
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,840
i call this this mu here which is the

205
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
the linear part of the mixed columns and

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
which is a bit structured because it is

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
it takes one byte and it will map it to

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
independently to do four

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
applications

210
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
so it's the concatenation of four bytes

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,520
here

212
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,960
and what will happen is that this phi

213
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
composed with this mu so let me call

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
that l

215
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,319
is a kind of explosive cocktail

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,759
reason is

217
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
that despite phi is

218
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
invertible

219
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
okay so imagine it is generated from

220
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,680
an injectable 32 by 32

221
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
matrix full of bits okay

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,399
the application from x to let's say

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,839
the eighth

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,958
first coordinates here

225
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
might not be invertible okay it can even

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
be you know

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
a constant

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
how is why is that it's because in my

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
thigh

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,160
not all the inputs are evaluated only i

231
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
would say a kind of hyperplane as you

232
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
can see okay because uh the i would say

233
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
the dimension of the input is only eight

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
you know whereas this application

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
normally can

236
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,839
can take as input a dimension of the 32

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,959
okay

238
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,880
and that that will be uh i would say

239
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
that the weakness that

240
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,839
will be exploited to reveal

241
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
the

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,800
okay

243
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
so

244
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,080
first distinguisher which is known is

245
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
that i mentioned already from south

246
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,880
street

247
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
from so

248
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,440
fsc

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
2016

250
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,720
where actually the leverage uh wild

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
transform

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
applied on this ak so ak is this

253
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
function or this one depending uh the

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
the key guess is the correct one or not

255
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
you see

256
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,480
and

257
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,399
so that's what is the spectrum by the

258
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,360
way

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
it is a spectrum

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
for boolean functions

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,839
where

262
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
there are two

263
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
masks input mask u

264
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
output mask v

265
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,720
and what is basically computed is a kind

266
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,440
of

267
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
balancedness you see so this uh wire

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
transform will will cancel uh if uh you

269
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
know this function is is balanced

270
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
because there will be as many you know

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
minus one and plus ones okay when it is

272
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
unbalanced then

273
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
we we have a

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
bias and so the function is is no longer

275
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,399
balanced

276
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,120
and so um

277
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
this distinguisher was actually

278
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,519
computing a kind of the the

279
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,880
total weight

280
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
of this spectrum

281
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
and was considering the smallest weight

282
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
right

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
so we introduce a new distinguisher

284
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,680
this distinguisher we will motivate it

285
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
by the way

286
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
which is um

287
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
kind of you know similar because um

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
we actually we just count the number of

289
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,560
zeros okay so we don't really scale with

290
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
the value of the spectrum with those

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
sums okay which can you know

292
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,959
go from

293
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,399
2 to the n

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,920
but also through 0 but also as as low as

295
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
minus 2 to the n now okay but we just

296
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,160
count whether or not it is zero and when

297
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
it is zero then we increment

298
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,320
and therefore we consider that maximum

299
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
and

300
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
as well so instead of just computing the

301
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
distinguisher on the coordinates so v

302
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
you see here is taken as

303
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,560
just selecting uh one of the 32 bits

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,680
we we can actually go uh byte by byte

305
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
you know

306
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
to to look for the

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
explosive cocktail i was mentioning okay

308
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
but this one is is suitable for the

309
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
white box cryptography

310
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
context where we can

311
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,279
extract the tables because we we need

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,920
exactly yeah to to count the zeros

313
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
whereas here as you can see it is more

314
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,959
scaling you know so so you can get an

315
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,440
idea from the humming weight typically

316
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
of the the leakage and so it

317
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,160
it is as well suitable for that grey box

318
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
context

319
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,800
okay

320
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
so

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
um

322
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
what's the difference between the two

323
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
distinguishers

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
so first of all uh our new distinguisher

325
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,880
is motivated by the fact that we have a

326
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,079
lemma i call it lema2 to refer to the

327
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
corresponding paper

328
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,839
so in this lemma we have that a function

329
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,959
which is

330
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
the composition of a linear and then a

331
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,880
bijective function

332
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,160
will have a number of zeros in the welsh

333
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
transform which depends

334
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
on

335
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
the

336
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
rank of uh

337
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,480
of l you know so if it is bjective

338
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
the rank of l will be maximum so in this

339
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,920
case will be eight okay but assume it is

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,120
less going to the the property that our

341
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
new function

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
is is not

343
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
exact i mean only a a subspace of it as

344
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
in the input uh is sent okay

345
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
uh then in this case uh the the number

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
of uh of zeros is uh

347
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,839
is growing actually

348
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,480
okay

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
so

350
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,000
we have a

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
by the way a distinguisher which is uh

352
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
more more tractable as well

353
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
and we will provide the proof that

354
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,839
it works okay and this proof is is

355
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,959
useful

356
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,160
um because it will give us a hint for

357
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
the countermeasure okay and at the same

358
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,519
time actually it provides a a series a

359
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,680
strong theoretical foundation while the

360
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
countermeasure works so so you see at

361
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
the same time we proved an existential

362
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
attack and at the same time

363
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,160
we we reinforce our counter measure okay

364
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
and

365
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
you know just lifting kochi farts

366
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,680
argument

367
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
we show that i actually

368
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
since our distinguisher is proved to

369
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,399
work it implies that the the former one

370
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
from satric

371
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,639
actually also works okay

372
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
all right so let's see how it works

373
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,680
let me first start by an illustration

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
let's count the number of

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
zeros in the while transform okay

376
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
in the two situations like before when

377
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
we have the correct key so the number of

378
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
zeros you see so it's a probabilistic

379
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,639
but it's a kind of you know large okay

380
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
whereas when we don't have the good key

381
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,160
so in our situation actually we have a

382
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
kind of run it is looking like a random

383
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
function

384
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,720
but but actually it is it is balanced

385
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
okay and we see that the number of zeros

386
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,000
are

387
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,399
very low okay and can you see the gap

388
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
here between the two so this really

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
means that the

390
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,670
distinguishing

391
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,320
[Music]

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
strength of the distinguisher is is

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
fairly high all right

394
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
okay let's uh formalize those things a

395
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,040
little bit

396
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,120
let me call r

397
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
uh the rank of

398
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
the l i so for

399
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
i which is one of the the four

400
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,480
bytes

401
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,160
um so and and introduce a couple of

402
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,480
notations over there so first of all

403
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
when you have the good key just

404
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
according to the lemma 2 i was just

405
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
mentioning

406
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
it's pretty simple the number of zeros

407
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,399
is equal to 2 to the n minus so 256

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
minus 2 to the r all right and so to

409
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
prove that the the

410
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
script analysis work

411
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
we need to

412
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
prove that for incorrect keys then

413
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,320
the number of zeros in this function

414
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
here

415
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,639
is

416
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,199
less than 2 to the n minus 2 to the r

417
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,240
okay

418
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,279
which

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,959
actually

420
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,720
will

421
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
be manageable

422
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,860
by using a crm

423
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,199
[Music]

424
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
which is not so well known

425
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
uh

426
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,639
i i recall it here uh so far from

427
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
uh bernasconi okay

428
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
and uh and

429
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,160
kotnoti

430
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,880
and

431
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
what it says is that the

432
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
you know the number of uh non-zero

433
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
values here

434
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
uh actually is larger than a quantity

435
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,079
which is uh related to the algebraic

436
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,920
degree of uh

437
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,800
of the the boolean function we consider

438
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,759
you see

439
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,120
so what we need to prove is that

440
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,440
the

441
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,720
[Music]

442
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
algebraic degree here

443
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
is actually

444
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
reaching

445
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
the highest possible value when we have

446
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
the

447
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
frankie okay so let me

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
show that with maybe intervals it will

449
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
be a little

450
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,519
easier okay so i consider the cases uh

451
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,439
where we can distinguish so i just

452
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,160
roll out the case where the rank is full

453
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,599
so i start by the rank

454
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
eight minus one and then other cases

455
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,799
like that

456
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
so

457
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,599
the

458
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,280
from the the crm one we have that uh the

459
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,439
number of zeros when we have the

460
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,720
incorrect key

461
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
is uh maximum so to do to the n minus

462
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,760
two to the

463
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
algebraic degree of the function i was

464
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
just mentioning

465
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
which

466
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,679
is actually

467
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,240
n minus 1 with an overwhelming

468
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
probability okay this is explained in a

469
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,160
theorem 2 in in our paper so we have the

470
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
bound like this and now the number of

471
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
zeros

472
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
for the correct key guess will be

473
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
more so we have a lower bound so it will

474
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,640
be you know between two to the n minus

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
one and to do the two to the n in this

476
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
case and when the rank is still uh

477
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,120
smaller um then actually we have this

478
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
interval and this interval and so so the

479
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,880
distinct

480
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
so you see here we distinguish but just

481
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,919
by nothing okay so we have no no room

482
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
between the the two

483
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
in practice as

484
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,880
you could

485
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
recall uh the values are much less but

486
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
so the bond we have here is kind of

487
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
conservative okay so we can make it

488
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
better

489
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
but anyway so when we distinguish even

490
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,600
better when when r is is a smaller

491
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,799
okay so

492
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
here is the proof

493
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
so how to repair the debuff scheme so

494
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
it's pretty easy

495
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
we simply need to ensure

496
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
that

497
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
the

498
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
functions li so there are four of them

499
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,760
and all of them must have a full rank

500
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,480
okay and so in those conditions the the

501
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,520
use of the the lema 2 is no longer

502
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,240
relevant okay

503
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
so the question is

504
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
is is it possible and

505
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
by the way

506
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
what's the probability that the attack

507
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
works so the attack works if any of the

508
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
li here

509
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,160
has not a full rank

510
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
which

511
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
happens you know with a probability as i

512
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,960
mentioned of more than 99 percent

513
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,400
right but now so if we restrict the

514
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
choice of the

515
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,039
32 to 32 linear mapping phi

516
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,320
to

517
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
a mapping such that all the four and i

518
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
are invertible

519
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,559
purely

520
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
it's a constraint but still we have a

521
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,799
lot of entropy and so we we don't uh

522
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
uh

523
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,039
we continue to hide the

524
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
key uh

525
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
from the the the t-box uh efficiently

526
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,840
okay

527
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
so uh to conclude

528
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
uh we introduced uh a new distinguisher

529
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,159
that

530
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,600
uh we found by uh analyzing the the

531
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,039
spectrum

532
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,760
of

533
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,440
the

534
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
the the the function when uh

535
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
when we peel off so

536
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,120
and by guessing exhaustively guessing uh

537
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
so the the key bite okay

538
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
so

539
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
the way we build the distinguisher is

540
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,559
really

541
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
motivated by the the study

542
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,080
of the statistics of the the

543
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
well transform

544
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
and we leverage lemma two and so

545
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
we understood that what is relevant for

546
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
discrete analysis is to count the number

547
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,640
of zeros in the y transform

548
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
as far as we know it the first time that

549
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,360
this property uh you know so we don't

550
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
want you know small values of the welsh

551
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,880
transform we want the zero okay uh if it

552
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
is you know like two or minus two we

553
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
don't care we want we want to count

554
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
zeros okay so it's kind of interesting

555
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
because it's the first time this problem

556
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
appears and so we managed to to provide

557
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
with a proof okay which was really not

558
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
so trivial

559
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
and so from this proof we managed to

560
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
derive a counter measure okay from the

561
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
selection of the the linear

562
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
function phi

563
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
so uh maybe there are even a stronger

564
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
distinguisher than than

565
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
the one we introduced but apparently we

566
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,919
we exploit for our analysis you know we

567
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,679
understood the weakness and we exploit

568
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,559
it so

569
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,919
we believe we are close to optimal

570
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,440
and so just time for me as well to to

571
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
thank the sponsors so

572
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,679
this work was uh partly uh

573
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,960
funded by a h2020 project the brain

574
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,000
project

575
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
and uh so the as well to the result of

576
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
the those

577
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
this analysis is included into the

578
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,760
worldbox crypto analysis uh

579
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,559
tool into the catalyzer

580
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
family of tools

581
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
which you know

582
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
for which you you can get some

583
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,919
information over those links

584
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,200
thanks a lot

585
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
for your attention

586
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,120
and final remark

587
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,760
there is a technical

588
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
specification which is about to be

589
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
published by iso so i was

590
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,159
very happy to to be the leader of

591
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,000
the write-up for for this document with

592
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
some

593
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
korean colleagues so you know please

594
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,640
find as well some guidance uh in this

595
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,280
document once it is published thanks a

596
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,918
lot bye
