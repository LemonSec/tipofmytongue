1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,680
and please start anytime enjoy

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
so

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
uh hello everyone it is my pleasure to

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,920
host this ask me anything session with

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
tanya lange

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,519
and i hope we have some some good

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
questions and good discussion in the

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,800
coming half an hour so um i guess tanya

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
needs no introduction in

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
any crypto security related venue but

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,039
if you would like to introduce her

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
maybe you would say that uh she's a full

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,120
professor

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,920
at

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
technical university at

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
eindhoven university of technology since

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
2006.

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
she got her phd from essen in 2002 uh

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,320
working on you're not going to believe

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
it hyper elliptic curves and afterwards

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,280
did postdoc in bohum

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
and then went as associate professor uh

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
to denmark and finally joined eindhoven

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
in 2006

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
uh basically her work uh is uh bridging

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
the gap between algebraic geometry

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
theoretical cryptanalysis and real world

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,960
information security

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
but basically everybody knows her as the

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
expert on kerberos

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
of course is serving on on many uh

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,320
things like editorial board journals

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
many pcs

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,960
organized many conferences she is also

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
uh in the workshop series on post

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,400
quantum crypto

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
uh

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
coordinated well-known uh eu h2020

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
project pq crypto encrypt post quantum

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
cryptography

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,360
uh i also noticed uh she uh graduated

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
close to 20 phd students so yeah we

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
could go on like this but

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
if uh i would say something about tanya

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
that you maybe don't know

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
i would also say that yeah actually i

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,479
know tanya since 2001

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
when she was a phd student in essen

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,759
uh you had this office in the attic

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,799
right

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,439
and uh yeah it was like really like very

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,240
very very uh kind of a strange place but

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
at the same time nice and and and quite

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
some people from the ccc community were

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
at that place at certain point in time

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
in the past two decades

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,280
and tanya had

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
professor gerhart freya as her

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
supervisor

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
and um maybe but also more junior people

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
uh don't know about her is that tanya

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
enjoyed knitting i guess you still do

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
but we don't see it in

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
this online setting so yeah

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,879
that's somehow something that that will

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
also probably uh come back later so yeah

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
one more anecdote i want to tell uh

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
tanya tanya is quite often knitting

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
socks and if you have a pair of socks

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
from tanya that that usually means

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
something right

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
and at some point i was asked when

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
travelling to balcom to one of the

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
events tanya organized to bring

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
some orange wool

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
because she she was supposed to do some

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
socks for for uh some dutch people and

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
apparently when she would ask so what

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
color would you like on your sock they

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
would usually say orange of course so

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
yeah

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
that was not so easy to find uh

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
elsewhere but in holland no problem so

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
you can get as much orange wool as you

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,440
need so that was no problem so yeah

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
uh please use now uh next uh yeah close

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
to half an hour to to to ask tanya

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
anything you've always wanted to to know

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,120
and

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
and didn't get a chance

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,599
so

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,239
um i will i will check the zoom look but

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
maybe we can uh kick it off with one

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
more question from me about um about

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
yeah because this is uh this is chess

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,319
and just is going on for like almost it

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
not almost it's more than two decades

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,799
now

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
um and i i guess you've been too many in

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
the past uh i don't know your first must

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
have been also

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,799
early 2000 or so when you were finishing

103
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,360
phd or or something like that it was

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
actually just when i started postdocs so

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,040
in 2003 when it was in cologne um so

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
power was organizing it there and so

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
essentially everybody who was involved

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
at that time got involved and that was

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,879
my first chess conference and it was

110
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,640
absolutely awesome to see all the

111
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,120
community and get to know this area i

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,798
mean i have been working on efficient

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,639
implementations

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,639
what a mathematician considers

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
official implementations basically

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
sitting there with pen and paper and

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,960
scribbling formulas and then doing some

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
implementations and see

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,040
timing them but i didn't actually do

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
like um

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
find field implementations myself at

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
that point it was all gmp-based and

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,000
there was so much call overhead and then

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
getting too

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
in touch with people who were actually

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
going not just like implementation at

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
the software level assembly and so on

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
but really going to hardware um and

129
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
putting those things together and not i

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,880
mean because the past group had had

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
awesome people like that so at that

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
point thomas wallinger was one of his

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,479
phd students a bit later

134
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,759
um

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
jan peltzer was starting so there were

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
lots of good people involved but then

137
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
seeing the whole community was really an

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
eye opener and i've been to most chess

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
conferences since there were a few that

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
i had to miss unfortunately but

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
yeah like looking back at many nice

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
chess conferences and well i'll see you

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,919
online yeah

144
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,639
yeah and i was gonna ask also like uh

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
how did uh how did it change for you

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
like do you do is kind of can you

147
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,240
comment on how

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
how different chess of today is than

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
from those days i mean mind the uh the

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
online part but like in terms of topics

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
in terms of you know

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
program papers submissions

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,919
that's a lot broader than it was back

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,639
then so it was with me more and hardware

155
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
getting like a breakthrough with getting

156
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
software things into chess and i mean

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
now we're seeing lots of software on

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
small devices at chess and i think it's

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
actually has a very good place here

160
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
and also one thing which i noticed in in

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
more recent chess is that we now even

162
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,039
have new designs published at chess

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,520
so it used to be like somebody makes a

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,000
system and then some years later there's

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
a paper chess showing how to implement

166
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
it i mean

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
i remember 2004 when i was in boston

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
there was like a chess when it was shown

169
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,039
that ecc can be faster than rsa and it

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,840
was like a big breakthrough in in these

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
conversations in these discussions and

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
limitations

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
but also we took looking at 2004 ecc was

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
introduced in 1985 so there's like a

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,000
huge gap of like catching up

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
and getting things deployed on small

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
devices 2001 i believe people were still

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
like super excited to get ecc put on the

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
smart card at all

180
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,800
not with security not talking about

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
cycling resistance or now masking or so

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,319
on but like getting it onto the device

183
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,479
at all and i think we have come a long

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,560
way since i mean for one thing our

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,880
devices have gotten more powerful but

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
even if you now go down to the basic

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,479
washing machine chips

188
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,800
community has figured out how to do some

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
crypto implementations even on the

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
smallest uh

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
devices that we we have sitting around

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
even on the 8-bit processes so i think

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
like a lot of broadening a lot more

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
papers

195
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
and i think it's also really really

196
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
interesting to see like postponing trip

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
to being here or the next session um

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
after our ama with like i won't got

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
crypto i like the title because that's

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
really what it is i mean it's

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,199
new crypto designs and breaking into it

202
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
with efficient implementation and seeing

203
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,919
how it fits

204
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,960
so i think lots of positive developments

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,000
yes so kind of yeah even broadening the

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
community

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
you would say right

208
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,759
yeah

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
uh you kind of already mentioned it but

210
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
maybe we can kind of

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
go back to that the uh post quantum

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,199
crypto uh deployment and in general how

213
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
is it going where where where does it go

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
uh in terms of standardization and the

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,199
competition so what are your thoughts if

216
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
you kind of want to to give us some help

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
right now most of us are really really

218
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
busy with the day-to-day business

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
because the competition is like

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,680
well

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
can you really say in the hot phase

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
after so many years but it still feels

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,639
like it's the hot phase because

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
decisions aren't haven't been made yet

225
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,599
so this is still the time where

226
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,759
i know many of the teams got requests

227
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,400
from from this to like investigate side

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
channel resistance or there are

229
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,399
some more questions about this or that

230
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,240
and we're interested in seeing like how

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
much faster you can go

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
um there's a fierce competition among

233
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,039
the latest candidates of course because

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
nist had announced that they would only

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
accept one of

236
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
uh sabre

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
uh kyber and andrew well i mean at most

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
i should say but i mean like there's

239
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
like kind of a pushing there and so also

240
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
in that field we see lots of invitations

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,600
and highlights and so on um

242
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,839
myself i'm in the competition with a

243
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,440
code based system so it's one of the

244
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
finalists this classic middle east

245
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
and this is a very nice one for hardware

246
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,880
in that it's uh all binary so it's

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
really uh happy for arithmetic it's

248
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
really kind of hardware circuit based

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,240
it's

250
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
the math behind it it's a big major

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
extent vector multiplication so pretty

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,120
simple operations as well but

253
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
to make it a lot more challenging um the

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
key sizes are very large so we're

255
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
looking at something where this big

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
matrix fits a megabyte and some

257
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,320
shameless promotion so later in this

258
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
conference there's also a talk by min

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
chang and tong shu where they show how

260
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
to get this deployed on cortex um m4 and

261
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,880
this is something which is non-trivial

262
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
so there's still challenges with with

263
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
different candidates

264
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,600
um but there's also a start already of

265
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
of kind of looking beyond the

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
competition i mean

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
i should also give a shout out to my

268
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
other teams so there's also enter prime

269
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
and uh and swings which i i strongly

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,560
hope

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
will do the standardization so i i

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,279
haven't given up on those just because i

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
didn't mention them so swings that's the

274
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
hash based signature system which

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is listed as an alternate but got an

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
honorable mention as something which is

277
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
actually ready for standardization and

278
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,519
we have seen some issues with some of

279
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
the signature systems so we are actually

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
optimistic that it might actually be in

281
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
the in the fourth round uh like sorry

282
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,760
not entering the fourth round but

283
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,279
standardized after the third round

284
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
before the fourth round and then enter

285
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
prime which i expect to get into the

286
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,079
fourth round

287
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,839
um but we're also thinking already

288
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,360
beyond like post quantum the postness

289
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,160
post quantum cryptography so what are we

290
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
doing after this misters announced

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
another round were they actually asking

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
for a post postponed when i see a

293
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,079
comment in the in the chat by logan's

294
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,959
funny

295
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,760
um

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
so

297
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
we're looking into like what is missing

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
in this competition list themselves i

299
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
said they would be interested in having

300
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
some signature systems which are based

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,360
on assumptions other than um lattices

302
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
so there's

303
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
work in their surgeon-based cryptography

304
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
community which

305
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
well has evolved a lot during the last

306
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
few years it's super interesting like

307
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
you mentioned before i come from

308
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
algebraic geometry elliptic curve kind

309
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,279
of stuff

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,200
and so i saw chinese other thing that

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
many of us are jumping on because it is

312
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
amazingly rich in the in the mathematics

313
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
you need there but also amazingly

314
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
applicable because you're getting

315
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
systems which are a lot smaller than any

316
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
of the other post quantum schemes but

317
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
also a lot more challenging so it's

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,519
really a

319
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
a nice area to play around and it's a

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
very friendly community so

321
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
if you like that field jump in it's it's

322
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
cool and there might even be something

323
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
to be submitted for in this competition

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
and then well

325
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,480
i mean we have the seaside um design

326
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
which achieves something which none of

327
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
them this candidate is doing maybe it's

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,399
doing a

329
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,079
non-interactive helmet exchange

330
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,600
but i wouldn't be comfortable at this

331
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
point pushing it for civilization but

332
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
it's certainly something i would like to

333
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
see more eyes on so there's i think post

334
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,639
quan will be with us for a while and

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
it is sufficiently challenging to get

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
onto small devices but i think it's also

337
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
a chess topic i mean this

338
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
this chess we have two full sessions on

339
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,839
post quantum and then we had a session

340
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,440
which even included like one group

341
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
analysis on elliptic curves so i think

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
we're gonna see a lot more hs in the

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,079
future

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
yes indeed

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
so maybe uh let's look at some questions

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
from the chat so um

347
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
turban asked

348
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
what is or was your favorite country to

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,639
live and work in maybe pre and post

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,720
endemic is not the same but yeah just

351
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
you know

352
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
yeah it's complicated i haven't actually

353
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
officially lived in so many countries so

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
i mean you ran through my cv so i mean

355
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,959
i've been germany denmark and the

356
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,040
netherlands

357
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
um but i had the luxury of living short

358
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,959
term like a few months or several months

359
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,600
at a time also in canada so there was a

360
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
long visit at the fields institute i was

361
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
at berkeley for

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
some time well several visits to chicago

363
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
many visits to taiwan

364
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
and so it's it's really hard to make a

365
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
decision there because it's like

366
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
so many different flavors uh i think

367
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
post pandemic taiwan certainly gets a

368
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
thumbs up for being the safest place on

369
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,720
earth

370
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
um and also very nice place if you're

371
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
into spicy food

372
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,560
and mountains

373
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
netherlands scores rather low on the

374
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,320
mountains part

375
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
but somehow i've been living there since

376
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,279
2007 so it's

377
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
apparently um it has something so

378
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,880
i think

379
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
it seems to work for you

380
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,279
if they are open um

381
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
i mean you're foreign most places you go

382
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
to and some countries are more welcoming

383
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
some countries are better with english

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
and that certainly certainly makes a

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
difference

386
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
indeed

387
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
and maybe one more question from norway

388
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,279
um any steps in your career that you

389
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,440
regret or would do differently today so

390
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
kind of some some tips for the new

391
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
generation

392
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
i guess it's this moment where you're

393
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
supposed to kind of reflect on your

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,800
shortcomings or whatever but

395
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
i i think i got pretty lucky and

396
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
happy with the decisions i made

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,959
also

398
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
i mean when i was on the job market well

399
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
how to say this i wasn't actually on the

400
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,279
job market when i came to eindhoven but

401
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
it was a very unusual time that suddenly

402
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,160
several senior positions were available

403
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,639
and that was uh due to many unfortunate

404
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,279
events so han sober team was sick in

405
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,320
bochum

406
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
uh thomas beethoven died in car school

407
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
and well happy occasion um eindhoven was

408
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
just looking for a new person and so i

409
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
was actually interviewing and in three

410
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
different positions and had kind of the

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
uh

412
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
the luxury of choice or the problem of

413
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
choice and so um i think it went well

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
um of course one always goes into like

415
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
hey how would it have been to be in

416
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,880
buchum it's it's a much bigger group but

417
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,560
i'm also pretty proud of what we build

418
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
up in eindhoven uh

419
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
not to compete with you later in naming

420
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,600
i think both groups are great um but so

421
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,639
i'm

422
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
pretty happy with having built my own

423
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
group having built much smaller than

424
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
gohan but my own empire there and then

425
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
still having good collaborations over

426
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
the world and in particular with boko

427
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
harakala initiative

428
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
yeah yeah location wise it's really good

429
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,120
you can kind of easily collaborate

430
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
exactly i mean like anything in europe

431
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
you're so well connected and you have so

432
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,399
many places around you have the train

433
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,440
system

434
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,199
netherlands germany belgium everything

435
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,720
is there so

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
yep

437
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
happy birthday

438
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,480
decision topics i think i got also very

439
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
lucky about

440
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,320
thinking about post quantum early on so

441
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
we organized the first post fund

442
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
workshop already in 2006

443
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,519
so advice to young people be adventurous

444
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
look at things um sometimes it's kind of

445
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
a weird feeling getting into a new field

446
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
that nobody is

447
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
working on yet but it makes you an early

448
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
adopter and that pays off in the end i

449
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,360
mean we did we did sharks which worked

450
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
pretty well like getting special purpose

451
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
hardware we did the post quantum series

452
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
which really um turned into something

453
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
but the early years went so easy so

454
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,160
trying to find money for post quant and

455
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
everybody was like oh but it's so far

456
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,279
away

457
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,079
and

458
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,079
now we all go like oh my god it's so

459
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,600
right there are we going to be fast

460
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
enough and so

461
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
yep as early adopter i go like told you

462
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,040
so

463
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,160
but these are the things you'll notice

464
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
yeah

465
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
good questions are popping in so let's

466
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
move on uh so boeing actually mentioned

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
something

468
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
as something that you kind of already

469
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
mentioned a bit how much do you think

470
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
recent results at chess with respect to

471
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
efficiency and side channels will end up

472
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
affecting the nist competition results

473
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
well as one of the people who is working

474
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
on this i do believe that this has a

475
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,679
strong influence i mean we can only

476
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
provide them with information and hope

477
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
that they listen

478
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,160
um

479
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,039
i do expect that they do look at how

480
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
much things can be implemented and there

481
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
were concerns about for instance classic

482
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,280
mcleans can it even be run on on small

483
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
devices and i think showing that yes it

484
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
is um working here

485
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,320
but also chess is not existing in a

486
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,799
vacuum so there are the conferences uh

487
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,320
also there was another

488
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,080
paper implementing classroom released on

489
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,919
a small device which was at cardis last

490
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
year and so showing the whole spectrum i

491
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,440
think chess is nice because we have a

492
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,760
huge community here so even if not

493
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
everybody is giving a talk everybody is

494
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
here we're having very active

495
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,760
discussions and i do hope that the

496
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
missed folks are listening i haven't

497
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
scanned their list of participants to

498
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
see whether they're

499
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,760
but uh seeing six screens full of people

500
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
um i hope that we have a quorum and i

501
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,000
understand it's maybe not the time zone

502
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
so they might be watching so this falls

503
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,720
yeah they're doing this um please take

504
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,200
into account all the cool results here

505
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
they can be on youtube also kind of more

506
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
behind the scenes yeah so no worries

507
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
kevin has a more kind of um open

508
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
question do you feel more like a

509
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,799
computer scientist or a mathematician at

510
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,080
this point

511
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
oh that's a really complicated question

512
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
i always dodged this question by

513
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
answering i'm a cryptographer

514
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
and

515
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,799
i'm actually surprised that you only say

516
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
math at computer science because i think

517
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
there's also a good portion of our

518
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
dna and electro engineering and in

519
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,600
particular with chess many of the things

520
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
we do here like building circuits or

521
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
thinking about side channels are more in

522
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
the ee field

523
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
and i think in order to

524
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
really feel like a cryptographer you

525
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
have to bring in all of those things

526
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
now there are some things where

527
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,799
your background does show i think the

528
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,160
mathematicians

529
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
are more nitpicky so having a background

530
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
in mathematics

531
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,000
makes you more like look for definitions

532
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
and makes you more

533
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
precise in statements and so in that

534
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,720
sense

535
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
i think i can't deny that i got my

536
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
degrees in mathematics my teaching is

537
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,919
still in mathematics so

538
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,400
if push to pick one of the three it's

539
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
math

540
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,080
but of course when i go to a math

541
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
conference they think of me as a

542
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
computer science or even engineering and

543
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,679
when you go to computer scientists

544
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
you're the mathematician so it's like

545
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
i think we're very happy when we're at

546
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
crypto conferences and we're a little

547
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
bit on the odd one out when you're at

548
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,320
one of the pure fields

549
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
i guess having the same applies to you i

550
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,679
mean you move from pure math to

551
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
like with big math and then

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
computer science so

553
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
or crypto

554
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,000
yeah but the questions for you

555
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
nice dodging

556
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,840
okay

557
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
so christine has a question

558
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
in a kind of male-dominated field okay i

559
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
was just waiting for this have you ever

560
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,480
had a moment where you thought this

561
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,120
would have gone smoother nicer better

562
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,559
with a more diverse crowd

563
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,159
phrase like this um i can't think of

564
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,679
something where

565
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
diversity would be more the issue but if

566
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
the question is whether there is some

567
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,000
issues with guys hitting on you i mean

568
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
i've now reached a level of um seniority

569
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
ugliness that doesn't happen anymore

570
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,520
plus bring one partner to conference

571
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
also helps but certainly in my younger

572
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
times there were some events where i

573
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
felt like yeah this is a little bit

574
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,919
awkward i i was hoping for getting the

575
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,240
compliments on my work and not for my

576
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
body parts

577
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,559
um

578
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,440
but

579
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
i've

580
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,200
like

581
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
for working on things

582
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,919
um many people say okay if you have a

583
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,400
more diverse team you get more more

584
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,600
influences

585
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
um i guess i'm too old and too used to

586
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
the system to really see differences

587
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
plus well whenever i'm there then i'm

588
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,879
bringing in the diversity so

589
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
indeed indeed you have it intrinsically

590
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,919
so

591
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,400
now we go to food uh i i guess you won't

592
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
mind because you already expressed some

593
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
so

594
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
christine also is asking which color is

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
your favorite chili pepper and and ben

596
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,000
followed on that with like what were

597
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
your top three hot sauces so you can

598
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,600
stick to it so the chili pepper

599
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:37,870
um

600
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,440
[Music]

601
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,840
i'm totally fine with boring red

602
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,000
chillies if they're like sufficiently

603
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,280
flavorful

604
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
um really exciting um in the netherlands

605
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
you can get a type is called a juma

606
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
pepper which is pretty close to

607
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
habaneros

608
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
and those are bright orange and have

609
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
just a fantastic flavor

610
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,120
second up would be chocolate habaneros

611
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
hot sauces um

612
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,559
[Music]

613
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,520
trickier i've sampled a whole bunch and

614
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,640
i wouldn't remember the labels so

615
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,919
i have to to skip on that one

616
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
but yeah i do like spicy food that seems

617
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,480
to be kind of implied by that and

618
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
definitely okay

619
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,039
sure

620
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
okay uh then

621
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,400
back to to research a bit um beau yuan

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
peng i've noticed that your team

623
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,400
proposed some improvements in seaside

624
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
which will be presented tomorrow and how

625
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,559
do you think seaside with respect to

626
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,960
performance issues

627
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
well um it's a great area for

628
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
improvements

629
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
meaning it is that slow and is somewhat

630
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,919
that slow now so compared to the other

631
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,960
postgrad candidates um well isotonians

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
in general are pretty slow and then

633
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
uh doing the

634
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,200
seaside version of misogynist compared

635
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
to the sidh version

636
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
is kind of doomed to be slower just

637
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
because of the way that the operations

638
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
work

639
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,240
but it also means that there's an

640
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,320
interesting challenge to get it somewhat

641
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,000
less pathetically slow and i think we

642
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
have reached a level

643
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
where if you want the functionality that

644
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,280
gives you

645
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
it is usable so i've seen some software

646
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,120
projects where

647
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
people go like hey i'd like to have some

648
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
post quantum things but the only thing

649
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
that fits for my data flow

650
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
is a seaside

651
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,000
um

652
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,559
jesus has done a great job to go

653
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,280
together with goga and francesco in

654
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
having a library where you can actually

655
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
do lots of things different isogen based

656
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,400
systems there's now also a python

657
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
version of it which is more portable and

658
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
of course those get even slower i mean

659
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
what we have here in seaside is actually

660
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,240
setting speed records

661
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,559
so in the c type paper here setting

662
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
speed records with the library in

663
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
particular the python version

664
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,679
it goes for usability and portability

665
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,240
and i think it's it an edge where if you

666
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
don't have to do it so often

667
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
it is usable

668
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,679
the more interesting question is

669
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
security

670
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,559
and well please script analyze

671
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,840
okay

672
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,600
so let's move to two platforms uh fabio

673
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
is asking if you think risk five will

674
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,600
play an important role in the industry

675
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
in the near future

676
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
ooh that is a interesting question so

677
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,320
i've been more optimistic in the past

678
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
than gotten a little pessimistic seeing

679
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,440
kind of

680
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,320
um

681
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,720
too much diversity there so getting

682
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
people to do efficient implementations

683
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
for something is

684
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,240
a lot of work

685
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
and if each instructional set has

686
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
something else then it's it's quite a

687
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,400
pain to do something

688
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
one size fits all and like i had a

689
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
student who brought the salt library to

690
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
it doing no instruction set extension so

691
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
really like the basic version

692
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
that is really really slow so no fun

693
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
doing that and then okay well the

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,279
multiplier is pretty likely the 32-bit

695
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
multiplier is pretty likely to be there

696
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
but then after that it's it's such a

697
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,320
gamble of what you're going to find on

698
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,679
the platform

699
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
um that i fear that it's not doing

700
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,440
itself a favor for being so open

701
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,559
and so

702
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,679
variable

703
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,159
now seeing um i was at the the taser

704
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,840
workshop yesterday evening and seeing

705
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
like more

706
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
more efforts to standardize things

707
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
having like a kind of this is what we

708
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
want to provide in crypto might

709
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,679
counterbalance that it needs to be seen

710
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
how much the industry adopts it because

711
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,159
in the end even if it's open i can't go

712
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,960
to my kind of workshop and just solder

713
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,520
myself a risk five i need some chip

714
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
producer to actually make one and if the

715
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,640
chip producing industry is seeing um

716
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,799
benefit in that in having kind of the

717
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,720
whole package then i think it's

718
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
it's more likely to succeed and

719
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,919
otherwise i'm some are pessimistic at

720
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,600
this point

721
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,760
so you don't expect that nist would also

722
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,799
consider uh risk five implementations

723
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
for the competition

724
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
for making a decision i think it's a bit

725
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
late right now because i mean they have

726
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
settled on the platforms and so lots of

727
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,159
the community has

728
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,320
well focused on on doing something

729
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
suitable for that for instance

730
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,440
the pq m4 team has done a great deal of

731
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
of getting all the different systems

732
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
into a comparable benchmarking there

733
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
and getting something similar working

734
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
for risk five at this point where they

735
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,279
want to decide around the turning of the

736
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,400
year

737
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
probably not not influencing the

738
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,360
decision

739
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,640
but i think for for platforms for chess

740
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
it's it's interesting

741
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
for platforms for actual deployment it

742
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
needs to be seen how much support there

743
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,240
is

744
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,600
indeed

745
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,400
uh

746
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
okay uh maybe interesting open

747
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,240
question from mark um say you had a free

748
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,279
wish

749
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,880
what would you like to change in the

750
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
academic world or the daily academic

751
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,760
work

752
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
moment where you have to think forever

753
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,720
until the the genie is getting bored and

754
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
then you say something so let me say

755
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
stuff that comes to my mind rather than

756
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
having kind of the concrete wish so this

757
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
is going to be more of a rambling rant

758
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,799
um

759
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,880
so i think one this thing which is a

760
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
problem in the academy academia is

761
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
how we evaluate each other

762
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,159
um in many situations i mean if it's if

763
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,080
it's peer review if we're talking to one

764
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,799
another we have a good idea of what

765
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,440
people are capable of we can say yes

766
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
conferences are so much more important

767
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,919
chess is so much more important for this

768
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,880
area so pay by chess is really is really

769
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,039
valuable and if i want to hire somebody

770
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
in this area i look for their

771
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
contributions to chess but then we get

772
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,880
to kind of the university or

773
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
worse for kind of countrywide

774
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
reviews where they have say

775
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
thomas's scientific and impact factors

776
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
and so on and

777
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,679
if i would change the system that would

778
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,679
be certainly something that could go out

779
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,320
of the window kind of it is convenient

780
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
for administrators to have numbers

781
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,919
but it so much misses the nuances of the

782
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,960
field

783
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,039
for instance coming from the more mathy

784
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,919
side

785
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
uh we write papers a lot slower than if

786
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,120
your approval security um

787
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
each paper is like a really

788
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
big work where you're going to this and

789
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
that you're finding implementation you

790
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,159
and in the other direction i have also

791
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,760
written some papers approval security

792
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
it's like an afternoon until you have a

793
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,159
proof i mean optimistically speaking but

794
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,039
it's

795
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,200
it's not comparable if you're doing page

796
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
count things so that is something and

797
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,200
then also

798
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,720
we don't have good metrics for including

799
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
um work such as open source software

800
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,039
or service to the community or artifacts

801
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,120
i really like how chess is now having

802
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
the artifacts and having the artifacts

803
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,600
review because it it makes your pre feel

804
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,120
appreciated for the work you're putting

805
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
into and big shout out to all the people

806
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,760
who have been putting effort into it i'm

807
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
sorry for have not having time enough to

808
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,080
join myself but i really appreciate what

809
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
you have all been doing there

810
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
and making this a stable thing having

811
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,679
artifacts posted on the web um having

812
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,840
the chess publications moved to open

813
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,480
access i think it's a fantastic thing

814
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,799
um so i i don't think i need kind of a

815
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,120
special genie for those wishes i really

816
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
like uh swimming along and seeing how

817
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
the chess community is doing things in a

818
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
way that i appreciate

819
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,399
but for the academic system metrics is

820
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
probably what it boils down to but then

821
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
within the metrics if the genie is is

822
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,279
more narrower saying hey but you cannot

823
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,840
say no numbers no impact factor and

824
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
please

825
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
include software then it will be a hard

826
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,600
choice

827
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,480
yes thanks great

828
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
let this end with something

829
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
more interesting for me so you were used

830
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
to travel quite a lot

831
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
so what do you expect will be your next

832
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,080
physical conference

833
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,159
oh i can't keep postponing it i had

834
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,399
really hoped to be intellectual uh later

835
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,720
this year there's a workshop on group

836
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
analysis which is one of the the

837
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,159
highlights getting people together on

838
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,000
these different areas

839
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
and they're gonna have some in-person

840
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
component and with at least one ice

841
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
hearing i just clicked i'm gonna

842
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,720
