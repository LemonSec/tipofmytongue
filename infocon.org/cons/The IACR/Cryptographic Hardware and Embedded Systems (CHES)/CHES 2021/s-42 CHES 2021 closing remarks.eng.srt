i think we still have some slots in the

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
in the social rooms for the final social

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
hour right

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
yes

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
the idea was to go to the social rooms

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
at this point

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
to have a final wrap-up and maybe a

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
final drink i feel now i'm quite relaxed

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
i don't know about you guys

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,159

70
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
general chairs and program chairs and

71
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,239

row we tried to go to beijing now and it

73
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,799

75
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,200
