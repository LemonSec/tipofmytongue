00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,240
hi everyone my name is isajan abedin and

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,480
i'm a research expert at imac cosec

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
research lab at kuluven

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,480
today i'm going to present to you an

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
accurate secure and practical narrowband

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
ranging system which is which is a joint

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,440
work with mohiddin al-susi

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
jack roma papayan boar and christian

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
bachmann from imac the netherlands and

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
dave singlet and myself from cosic

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,640
secure ranging has a wide range of

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
applications for example in passive

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,200
keyless entry systems

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
contactless payment systems or

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
smart access control systems just to

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
name a few

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,160
but one of the biggest security threats

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
to these systems is relay attack

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,920
in which an attacker relays

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,719
possibly manipulated signals between the

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
legitimate players in order to decrease

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
the measured distance

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,120
an effective count to measure against

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,399
relay attacks is distance bounding

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
a distance bounding protocol adds an

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
authentication layer to ranging

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
more specifically an authentication

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
protocol is a cryptographic protocol

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
between two parties

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
that allow the two parties to

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,400
authenticate each other and to establish

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
an upper bound on the physical distance

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,880
between them

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,479
proposed in 1993 by branson chom

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,640
distance bounding protocols had been

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
widely studied

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
especially in the last decade or so

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
one of the key research challenges

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
is

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
a secure and practical implementation of

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
distance bounding protocols

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
there are a number of ways to implement

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
distance bounding solutions

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
for example one can use

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
received signal strength which is easy

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
to implement but

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
also easy to break

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
an attacker can defeat a system

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
with a simple use of an amplifier signal

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,799
amplifier

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,199
and one can also use a round trip time

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
or time of flight

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
of the signals

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,120
to

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
measure the distance

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,360
and this has good security properties

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
and it's well suited for ultra wideband

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
but it's hard to implement securely in

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
practice

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
there's also phase based ranging which

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
has good accuracy and well suited for

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
narrowband for example bluetooth low

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,360
energy radios

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
but it's vulnerable to phase

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,920
manipulation attacks

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
so in this work we combine

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
phase based ranging with time-of-flight

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,599
measurement

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
which

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
overcomes

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
the

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
pitfalls of

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
the two separate approaches and combines

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
the best of

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,519
the two worlds so

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
we applied a phase measurement

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,480
for

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,280
accurate ranging and time of flight for

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
mitigation of phase manipulation attacks

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,280
so at this point you may wonder why

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
narrowband or why in particular ble

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,959
bialy is supported by a vast

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
commercial ecosystem and and is often

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
built into

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,480
smart devices

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,799
functionalities like low power

87
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
consumption and low cost make ble an

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
ideal candidate for secure ranging

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
solutions

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
in our work we we use the preamble of

91
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,239
the ble frame structure to detect the

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
signal and to set the automatic gain

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
control value and to estimate the

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
carrier frequency offset

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
and the frame delimiter to

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,959
synchronize

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
to authenticate the packet

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,319
and

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
to estimate the time of arrival of the

100
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
packet

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,439
and the protocol data unit contains the

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,640
payload

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,680
and finally the constant tone is used

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
for phase based ranging

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
so a distance bounding using ble radios

106
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,440
looks like this

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
the verifier sends

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
a ble packet followed by a constant tone

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,000
and as a response the prover

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
first sends the constant tone and then

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
the response packet

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,919
a high level overview of the secure

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,600
distance bounding protocol that we

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
design and implement in this paper is as

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
follows

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
the verifier and prover first establish

117
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
a shared secure key using an

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,440
authenticated key exchange protocol

119
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
and then they use the establish shared

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,080
key to generate the challenge and

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
response in the next phase in which the

122
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,880
verify and prover

123
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
exchange in a fast manner packets and

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
tones

125
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
and they measure the iq values of the

126
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
tone the constant tone

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
and

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
also

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
time of arrival and time of departure of

130
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,919
the packet and in the last phase the

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,280
prover will send its measurement results

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
back to

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
the verifier and the verifier will

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
estimate the distance based upon the

135
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
measurement results

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
and makes

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
its decision

138
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
in the next few slides we'll take a

139
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
closer look at the details of each one

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
of these steps

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
for the authenticated key exchange we

142
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
use a well-known protocol namely the

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
sigma protocol by crouching

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
as you may remember from the previous

145
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
slide

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
the approver and verifier know each

147
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
other's public key so in our

148
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
implementation they do not send each

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
other's public key

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,919
in

151
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
the second and third stages of the key

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,520
exchange protocol and we use 4q elliptic

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
curve for the implementation

154
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
the next stage of packet and tone

155
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
exchange is also known as distance

156
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
bounding stage

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
and in this stage the verifier and

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
prover engage in an exchange of

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
challenge and response

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,039
on each carrier frequency

161
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
and

162
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
they measure the time of departure and

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,960
time of arrival of each packet they're

164
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,240
sending and they're receiving

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
and they also measure the iq values of

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
the constant tone that's sent along with

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
the challenge and the response

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
and

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,479
once one has access to all the timestamp

170
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
measurements one can easily calculate

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
the time of flight based on this simple

172
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
formula

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
to understand how phase-based ranging

174
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
works let's take a look at multi-carrier

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,800
phase difference or mcpd

176
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
in mcpd what each party does

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
is basically to measure the difference

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
between the phase of the pllocal pll on

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
the same frequency as the arriving tone

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
and once one has access to the

181
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,479
estimated phase difference

182
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,160
on each

183
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,280
side

184
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,400
then one can obtain the round-trip phase

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,759
so what

186
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
is that if we execute this uh procedure

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,479
on at least two frequencies then we can

188
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
obtain

189
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,520
the distance as uh estimated distance as

190
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,639
follows

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
and here

192
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,319
this figure is the

193
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,400
uh ambiguity bound

194
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,280
uh

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
so

196
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
if we have

197
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
a frequency step size of 1 megahertz

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
then the ambiguity bound is 150 meters

199
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
and if

200
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
the frequency step size is 2 megahertz

201
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,879
then

202
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,199
75 meter is the ambiguity bound and so

203
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
on

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
the end of the distance bounding stage

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
the prover sends

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
all its measurement results to the

207
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
verifier

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
the measurement results include the iq

209
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
measurements of each tone

210
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,479
the status of the received

211
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
challenge and time

212
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
stamp measurements of the received

213
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
challenge and

214
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
the sent response

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
once verifier

216
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
receives these information from the

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
prover it

218
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,440
estimates the time of flight of

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
each

220
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
packet

221
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
and then

222
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
proceeds to calculate the number of

223
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
rounds in which the

224
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,640
in which both the challenge and response

225
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
are correct

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
and the time of flight is below the

227
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
ambiguity bound

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
and then it

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
calculates

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,959
if the number of rounds is less than

231
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,800
a preset threshold for the correct

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
number of rounds

233
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
it

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
estimates the average time of flight and

235
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,839
checks whether that is below the circle

236
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
of trust and only then it

237
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,959
uh proceeds to calculate the

238
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
distance using the estimated phase

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
and

240
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
if the phase based distance is below the

241
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
threshold

242
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,519
below which the approver can access to

243
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
the resources provided by the verifier

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
controlled by the verifier

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,119
verifier gives access to the approver

246
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
so what the verifier basically does in

247
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
this stage is

248
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
first to bring everything below the

249
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
ambiguity bound and then check whether

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
the time of flight gives

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
a distance

252
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
which is

253
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
below the circle of trust

254
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,519
which allows the

255
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,800
verifier to trust the

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
phase based distance measurement

257
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
i won't go into the details of the

258
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,519
security analysis which you can read in

259
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
detail in the paper but only mentioned

260
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
briefly that the proposed secure

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
distance bounding protocol is resistant

262
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,880
against

263
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
all logical layer attacks

264
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
as well as

265
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
the implementation known implementation

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,399
layer attacks

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
so

268
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
in that sense

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
the proposed protocol

270
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,959
combines

271
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
the best of both worlds

272
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
we implemented the design solution on

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
the nxp kew 36 ble chips

274
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
and what you see here on the verifier

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
side the device that's connected to the

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,360
ble chip is

277
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,959
a raspberry pi

278
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,079
used for

279
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,320
access control

280
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
we first measure

281
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
the distance using

282
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
phase

283
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
and the time of flight measurements

284
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,399
in outer environment

285
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
when the verifier improver are separated

286
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,640
from each other at various distances

287
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
this is our measurement results for 10

288
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,959
different distances between the verifier

289
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,680
and

290
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
the prover

291
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
if we look at the precision and the

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
accuracy of the distance measurements

293
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,440
we can observe that the phase based

294
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,760
measurement is highly accurate and

295
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,279
precise

296
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,519
and the time-of-flight

297
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
base distance estimation

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
is

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
although

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
not

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
as accurate as the phase based distance

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
measurement

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
is sufficient

304
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
to

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
protect against phase manipulation

306
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,839
attacks

307
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,519
as we will see in the actual

308
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
really relay attack evaluation later on

309
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
we further do measurements when

310
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
the verifier and prover are

311
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
closer to each other and far away from

312
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
each other but not

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
beyond the

314
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
ambiguity bound of course

315
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,519
and

316
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,519
in both scenarios

317
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,399
our obtained results are as expected

318
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
finally we evaluate the relay attack in

319
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
particular the phase rollover attack on

320
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
our system

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
in this setup the verifier and prover

322
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
are beyond each other's communication

323
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,200
range

324
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,680
and the adversary the relay attack

325
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
adversary

326
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
consists of two antennae and a cable

327
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
connecting the two antennae and it

328
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
simply relays

329
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,079
the

330
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
signal between the verifier and prover

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
without any processing

332
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
and

333
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
we use frequency step size of 4

334
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,399
megahertz just so that we have a

335
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,680
37.5 meter for the ambiguity bound

336
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
this is

337
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
so that we can

338
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
use

339
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
evaluate the attack using shorter cables

340
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
and what we obtain is

341
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,959
again

342
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
demonstrates that the

343
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
time-of-flight measurement

344
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
offers protection against such

345
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,680
phase

346
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
rollover attack

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
because what we see is that the phase

348
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,680
based

349
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
distance estimation gives a uh

350
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
a small distance because the phase

351
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,000
already has rolled over

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,079
but

353
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
the time of flight

354
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
measurement gives a distance which is

355
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
beyond the ambiguity bound indicating

356
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
that the

357
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
phase has already been uh rolled over

358
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
so

359
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,079
the phase based distance cannot be

360
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,160
trusted

361
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,079
to summarize in this paper we have

362
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,480
designed and implemented an accurate

363
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,040
secure and practical narrowband ranging

364
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,959
system combining phase-based measurement

365
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
offering

366
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
an accuracy of less than 30 centimeters

367
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
with a precision of

368
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
less than 2.5 centimeters

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,920
and time-of-flight measurements

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
for protection against phase

371
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,760
manipulation attacks

372
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,079
an interesting future work work would be

373
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,320
to extend the current work

374
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,040
to

375
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,480
a setting of secure group ranging

376
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,399
with that i thank you all for your

377
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,399
attention
