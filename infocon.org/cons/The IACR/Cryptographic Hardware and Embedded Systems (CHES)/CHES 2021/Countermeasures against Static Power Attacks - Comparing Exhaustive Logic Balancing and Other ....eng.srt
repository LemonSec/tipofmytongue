00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,679
hello and welcome to this presentation

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,839
of the paper counter measures against

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,839
static power attacks comparing

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,160
exhaustive logic balancing and other

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
protection schemes in 28 nanometer cmos

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
my name is thor moss and this is a joint

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
work with my advisor amir moradi from

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,599
the rho university borum

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
this presentation deals with static

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
power side channel attacks

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,320
in the past few editions of chess

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
multiple works have been presented which

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,399
showed that the standby power of cmos

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,399
chips which is also called the static

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
power consumption reveals information

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,800
about internally stored and processed

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,160
data

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,399
in consequence it has been demonstrated

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,239
that this side channel can be used to

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,719
successfully extract secrets from

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,640
cryptographic devices in order to

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
circumvent critical security features

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
there are a number of differences

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
between this side channel and the much

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,360
more frequently exploited dynamic power

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
consumption of cmos ics

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
first of all the standby power of cmos

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,080
chips was extremely small in the past

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
when ics were still manufactured in

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,360
technology generations of 200 or 300

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
nanometer

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
however with the downscaling of the

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
technology the leakage currents became

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
larger and larger and now they consume a

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
pretty significant share of the power

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
budget of devices in current nanometer

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
technologies

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,439
therefore static power attacks may not

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,360
have been relevant in the past but they

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
are certainly relevant now

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
the second difference to the dynamic

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
power consumption is that adversaries

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
can amplify the leakage of information

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
to a large extent by increasing the

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,439
working temperature and the supply

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
voltage of the device under test

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,240
for many physical adversaries it is

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
possible to influence these outside

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
factors

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
while a traditional power analysis

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
attacker can only exploit secret values

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
at the time they are actively processed

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
in the circuit a static power adversary

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
can extract information as long as the

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
data of interest is present anywhere in

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
the circuit

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,719
finally if an attacker obtains clock

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,640
control or if the data of interest

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
remains present in the circuit for a

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
longer period of time without being

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
operated on measurements with an

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
extremely low noise level can be

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
collected due to simple averaging over

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,599
time

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
this example here illustrates the main

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
security problem in a pretty simple

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,959
manner

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,959
what we see here is a table listing the

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
leakage currents conducted by a common

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
two input nor gate and 22 nanometer

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
technology for different logical values

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,319
of its input signals a1 and a2

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
it is obvious that the leakage currents

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
conducted through the cell in a stable

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
state heavily depend on the input

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
signals

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
leakage tables like this one exist in

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
each standard cell library for any cell

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,959
here the leakage current for input

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
combination zero one is more than four

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
times larger than the leakage for input

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,640
combination one one such a strong data

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
dependency is exactly the reason why

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
adversaries can exploit the standby

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
power to extract hidden internal

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
information from cmos chips

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
here is another example in the same

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
technology node but for a d-type

89
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
flip-flop

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
interestingly the leakage current of the

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
flip-flop does not only depend on the

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
inputs d and the clock but also on the

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
output value q

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,840
which can be independent of the current

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
value of d

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
typically the registers are not the main

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
drivers of the information leakage but

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
it is important to remember this output

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
dependency for the counter measures we

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
explained later

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,200
while all previous experimental works on

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
the subject have concentrated on

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
exploiting the static power consumption

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,360
in the most clever or easy way

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
we focus here on the constructive side

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,319
and develop practically evaluate and

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
compare a number of countermeasures

108
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
against this threat

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
and we do this with the help of a 28

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,159
nanometer asic that we have specifically

111
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
designed and manufactured for this exact

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
purpose

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
the counter measures that we introduce

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
and analyze in the following will all be

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
applied to a very compact serialized

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,519
hardware implementation of the block

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,920
cipher present 80 which you can see on

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
this slide

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
it essentially consists of one 4-bit

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
s-box circuit a state and key register

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
and a bit of control logic and that's

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
all

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
now let's take a look at the hiding

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
counter measures we have evaluated in

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,919
this work

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
to be honest this first one can barely

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,639
be called a countermeasure at all it is

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
more of a design strategy that reduces

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
the leakage namely in modern cmos

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
libraries standard cells typically exist

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
in multiple different versions with

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
different threshold voltages to fully

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
take advantage of the latency versus

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
leakage trade-off

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
cells with a higher threshold voltage

136
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
have a larger latency but consume a

137
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
lower standby power

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
therefore implementing cryptographic

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
algorithms using only such high

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
threshold voltage cells should reduce

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,600
the exploitable signal that is available

142
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
to static power adversaries

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
the second counter measure is the most

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
simple form of shuffling namely random

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
start index shuffling

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
here in each round a 4-bit random number

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
decides which state and key nibble are

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,320
passed through the s-box circuit first

149
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
to start the rotation from that point

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
as a result state nibble 5 for example

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
is processed at different points in time

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,759
in each recorded measurement

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
while the exact timing and alignment of

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,320
traces is not as important for static

155
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
power adversaries as for dynamic power

156
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,639
adversaries it still leads to the

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
situation that state nipple 5 for

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
example is present in a different

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,280
circuit part each measurement which

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
consequently creates noise and reduces

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,720
the measurement quality

162
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
the third countermeasure we evaluate is

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,759
called symmetric dual ray logic in short

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
sdrl

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
essentially each gate in the circuit is

166
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
duplicated and the duplicated cell

167
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
receives the inverted input

168
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,919
this technique is based on the

169
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,319
assumption that each cell leaks a

170
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,560
current exactly according to a leakage

171
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
table like the one we have seen

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
previously for the nor gate and the d

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
flip flop

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
under this assumption the balanced

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,440
inverter is actually secure in the sense

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
that an adversary cannot distinguish

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
whether input i is zero or one

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
because in both cases one inverter

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
receives a zero and one inverter

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
receives a one and the cumulative

181
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,759
current does not give any information

182
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
about which inverter receives which

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,199
input

184
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
in reality of course there are tiny

185
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,039
differences between the leakage of two

186
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,800
instantiations of the same cell due to

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,720
intradiprosis variations aging effects

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
and via imbalances of the connected

189
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,919
signals

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,759
however these effects are expected to

191
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
have a rather small impact on the static

192
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
leakage in stable states which is why

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
the estimation of the leakage currents

194
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,479
using such leakage tables is common

195
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,400
practice in ic design

196
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
for the nor gate and the flip flop

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
however the balancing is not optimal

198
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
even without considering differences

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
between multiple instantiations of the

200
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
same cell

201
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
for the nor gate for example the input

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
combination 0 0 for a1 and a2 can still

203
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,440
be distinguished from the input

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,479
combination 0 1. yet a reduction of the

205
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
exploitable signal is expected

206
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
the next counter measure we have

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,039
considered in our comparison is called

208
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
quadruple algorithmic symmetrizing in

209
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,759
short quad seal

210
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
it has been proposed as a counter

211
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
measure against both dynamic and static

212
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
power analysis attacks

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
essentially quadzilla quadruples the

214
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
unprotected circuit while in three of

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,160
the four copies the s-box table is

216
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,039
modified as detailed on this slide

217
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
then a random permutation of inputs keys

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
inverted inputs and inverted keys is

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
selected from 24 possibilities and the

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
values are given to the four circuits

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
the idea behind quad seal is to balance

222
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
all hemming weights and distances

223
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
occurring in a cipher implementation and

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,680
rotating the inputs to the balanced

225
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
structures to account for remaining

226
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
dependencies due to process variations

227
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,319
aging effects and pass imbalances

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
the final hiding counter measure we

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
analyze is called exhaustive logic

230
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
balancing in short elb

231
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,039
this counter measure has been newly

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
developed for this work and is

233
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,200
essentially a logical continuation of

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
the sdrl technique

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
here we make the same assumption as

236
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
previously namely that each standard

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
cell instantiation leaks exactly

238
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,600
according to its corresponding leakage

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,279
table

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
then we build the balanced versions of

241
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
the standard cells in such a manner that

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
under the set assumption the leakage

243
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
current should be perfectly constant and

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,800
independent of the applied signals

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
for the nor gate you can see the result

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
here

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
in order to gain a better impression of

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
the logical behavior of the circuit we

249
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
have denoted exemplary input values here

250
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
for a1 and a2 being both zero we have

251
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
two inverters receiving a zero and two

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
inverters receiving a one

253
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
we also have one nor receiving a zero

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
zero one receiving a zero one another

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
one receiving a 1 0 and the last one

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
receiving a 1 1.

257
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
in fact the same holds for any

258
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
combination of a1 and a2

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
take a look here

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
here

261
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
and here

262
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
of course we now need to replace each

263
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
nor gate in the implementation we want

264
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
to protect by a circuit containing four

265
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
inverters and four nor gates which leads

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
to quite some overhead

267
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
by the way the zn outputs which are not

268
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
needed can simply be left unconnected

269
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
the situation is even more complex for

270
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
the d flip flop

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
we have seen earlier that a d flip flop

272
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
not only leaks about d but also about q

273
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
since q is an output we cannot apply the

274
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
same technique as for the nor gate

275
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
instead we need to choose the input

276
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
values for the four flip flops as a

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
function of their output values

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
when focusing only on balancing the d

279
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,440
and q pins of the flip-flops for the

280
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,160
moment we can achieve balanced input

281
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
output combinations using the circuit

282
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,680
below

283
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,360
let's look at some values again

284
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
if in the previous cycle d was 0 and in

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
this cycle d is 0 again then we

286
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,480
have all possible d and q combinations

287
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
from 0 0 to

288
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
1 1 represented

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
and again the same is true for all other

290
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
possibilities see here

291
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
here

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,279
and here

293
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
up to now we have ignored the data

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
dependent leakage of the three input

295
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,200
xnor gate and the two inverters in order

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,120
to make them independent of the applied

297
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
signal values we have to change the

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
circuit like this

299
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,640
here each

300
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,680
elb nor is one of the balanced nor gates

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
constructed previously

302
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,600
it is clear that replacing each

303
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
flip-flop in a circuit by this huge

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
structure leads to a very significant

305
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
area overhead

306
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
however assuming the simplified model of

307
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
a table based leakage current we are

308
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
able to construct arbitrary circuits

309
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
with a constant and data independent

310
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
leakage current

311
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
now we have also considered a masking

312
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
scheme to combine with the hiding

313
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,638
counter measures detailed before

314
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,959
in fact we have chosen a simple

315
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
threshold implementation of the

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,639
serialized present at cipher this

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
implementation uses three shares and a

318
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,839
decomposed s box to offer first order

319
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
side channel security

320
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
in the following we quickly present the

321
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,440
target device we have designed and the

322
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
measurement setup for the practical

323
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
experiments

324
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
here you can see the 28 nanometer cmos

325
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
chip we have developed for this

326
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
investigation

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
on the left the layout is presented and

328
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
on the right a microscope photography of

329
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
the manufactured and bonded die of the

330
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,680
asic is shown

331
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
each side of the chip is only 1.3

332
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
millimeters long

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
for those of you who wonder what kaza is

334
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
this is the name of the excellence

335
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
cluster at the whole university bohum

336
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
through which this research project was

337
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
funded in the last years

338
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
these 11 different present cores are

339
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
implemented on the asic and their post

340
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
layout area consumption is listed in the

341
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
table

342
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
additionally we have calculated the

343
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,680
overhead factor for the application of

344
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
each of the counter measures in

345
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
comparison to the unprotected circuit

346
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
while the random start index shuffling

347
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
is comparably cheap to apply the

348
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
balancing techniques already cause an

349
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,360
overhead factor of four to eight

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,720
combined with the threshold

351
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
implementation which itself causes about

352
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
a three-fold area increase the

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
exhaustive logic balancing comes at an

354
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
overhead factor of about 23.

355
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
of course this is very significant but

356
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
the 60 000 gate equivalents might still

357
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
be reasonable for a well-protected

358
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,319
crypto primitive in some applications

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
this illustration shows the experimental

360
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
setup we have used to analyze the cipher

361
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,360
implementations on our asic

362
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
the chip sits on a board and is placed

363
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
inside a climate chamber to increase its

364
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
working temperature to 90 degrees

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
celsius

366
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
the asic is powered through a source

367
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
measure unit which supplies an increased

368
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
voltage and measures the current drawn

369
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
by the asic when the cipher operation is

370
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
stopped at the end of the first round

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
for about 100 milliseconds

372
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
here are two pictures of the source

373
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,360
measure unit and the asic sitting on our

374
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,639
custom measurement board

375
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
i don't have the time to show all

376
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,360
practical results that are included in

377
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
the full paper but here are the most

378
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,480
important parts of it

379
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
in the first step we have performed

380
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
leakage assessment in a fixed versus

381
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,600
fixed manner the left side of the slide

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
shows the results for the unprotected

383
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
circuit on top for the shuffled circuit

384
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
in the middle and for the elb circuit on

385
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,959
the bottom

386
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
the right side shows the results for the

387
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
same hiding counter measures in the same

388
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
order but combined with the threshold

389
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
implementation

390
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
for each experiment a histogram of the

391
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
two fixed groups is shown in addition to

392
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
a t-test and a g-square test result

393
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
it is obvious that the unmasked circuits

394
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
all show detectable leakage in the first

395
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
order although the two groups are harder

396
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
to distinguish for the elb measurements

397
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
it is still very possible

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
the mast variants show neither first nor

399
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
second order leakage

400
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,639
it has been shown in previous works

401
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,480
already that three share threshold

402
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
implementations are mostly vulnerable in

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
the third order with respect to static

404
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
power adversaries

405
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,079
and the mass variant without hiding

406
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,959
countermeasure and the shuffle ti indeed

407
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
shows significant detectable leakage in

408
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
the third order

409
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
however the two fixed groups measured

410
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
for the combination of elb and ti seem

411
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
to be indistinguishable using half a

412
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,639
million measurements

413
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,160
after the leakage assessment we also

414
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
performed key recovery attacks in order

415
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,720
to determine how many measurements are

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,360
required to reliably extract key

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,639
information

418
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
this number of observations is listed as

419
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
data complexity or dc year

420
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
clearly the most effective combined

421
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
counter measure is also the most

422
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
expensive one namely exhaustive logic

423
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
balancing applied to a threshold

424
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
implementation

425
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,519
the corresponding attack requires about

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,399
3 million traces which took more than 90

427
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
hours of non-stop measurements to

428
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
acquire

429
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,320
in addition to the absolute dc values we

430
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
have also listed dc per gate equivalence

431
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
here to judge the cost effectiveness

432
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
the most cost effective combination is

433
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
actually the shuffle threshold

434
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,720
implementation which is about six times

435
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
cheaper than the elb threshold

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,240
implementation

437
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
it also becomes clear from the table

438
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
that neither hiding nor masking alone

439
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
provide a sufficient security level

440
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
against this kind of attacker and that

441
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,199
combined counter measures are certainly

442
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,199
required

443
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
to conclude we have seen once again that

444
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,000
the standby power of cmos chips reveals

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,640
secrets to potential adversaries

446
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,799
we have provided a first comprehensive

447
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,640
comparison of countermeasures against

448
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,959
static power attacks and did so with a

449
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,199
dedicated test chip in an advanced cmos

450
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
technology generation

451
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
by doing this we have learned that

452
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,199
neither hiding nor masking alone seem to

453
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,200
protect sufficiently against the threat

454
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
but also that strong protection can be

455
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,080
achieved using combined countermeasures

456
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
however those typically come at a

457
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
significant price in terms of area

458
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
overhead

459
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,919
thank you very much for your attention
