1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,839
excellent great so welcome to the first

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
ask me anything session of chess 2021

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,080
um

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,000
my name is benedick i have the pleasure

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
to spend half an hour with colin

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
uh hey colin so

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,840
yeah actually i'm

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,199
i'm already confused because i'm not

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,800
sure you know what what's the correct

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
time of the day to greet you like should

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
i say good night or you know

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
for me it's good morning but

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,279
i guess i think we we crossed in the

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
morning now five that's pretty good

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
oh you're at five okay that's good yeah

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,360
people are plausibly starting their day

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
are you still awake or already awake

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
already awake so already wait okay

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
excellent early morning wow

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,760
i'm impressed well thanks for um

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
finding time at this time of the day

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,879
um

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,280
so i was wondering maybe if um

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
we could start off with you telling us a

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
little bit something or not actually

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
maybe i should introduce you for a few

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
people who may be here who don't know

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,520
you so um colin is uh

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
quite quite a you know textbook example

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
of an arounder

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
so he's been in his previous life he's

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
been working on various hardware design

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
topics such as pcb layouting rf designs

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
embedded firmware and all these sort of

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,880
things for various

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
companies and customers

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,119
and so on

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
and i guess at some point we just got

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
interested in embedded security for one

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
or the other reason

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,920
and also decided to actually pursue a

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
phd on the topic

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
and i guess that at some point he kind

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
of figured out that there's no

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
inexpensive well-documented

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
hardware available

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
for people to get started with their own

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
experiments

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,720
and long story short and he kind of

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
ultimately decided to you know

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
take the opportunity and start to build

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
things by himself

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
um which he did very successfully and

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,399
even created

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
a

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
a startup company around it

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
which is new ie which

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
produces among other the very well-known

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
chip whisperer platform which is now

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
used i think all over the world

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
i think by tons of people who are very

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
glad that

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
colin did it and and made it possible

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
for them to work

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
so colin maybe we can start with you uh

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
yeah maybe speaking of a little bit

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
about you know that time so because i i

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
remember like i remember when you

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
started to show up

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
at conferences and and you know you were

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
that you were just one guy who

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
you know didn't use the nominal skill

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
oscilloscope for experiments like like

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
anyone else did but you know he came

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
with this other thing

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
um how was that

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,239
uh it was good so i mean the the sort of

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
back story too

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
to where chip whisperer came from

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
um is at

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
the university so when i started it was

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
a bit random uh the introduction to

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
embedded security so there wasn't people

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
doing this work and there was limited

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
good oscilloscopes um so the one

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
high-speed oscilloscope was also being

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
multiplexed with other other people

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
using it

89
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
um

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
so it was one of the motivations was it

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
was a hassle to use it because there'd

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
be someone messing with your setup um so

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,760
that was one of the the reasons that

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
said hey like why don't i just make

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
something that you could use

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
um and not have other people mess with

97
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
it you know in the meantime

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,480
um but yeah it was funny starting i mean

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
people who are at fit the first chess i

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
was at uh but you know just sort of

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,959
introducing to people and and for me the

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,400
part of the reason that pushed me to do

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
this sort of

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,760
bring it into something broader was just

105
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
talking to people and like um everyone

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,519
was quite i don't know i want to say

107
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,440
welcoming to it um

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
they're quite interested in the idea you

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,159
know even right at the beginning when it

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
was very uh hacky i don't think people

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,280
thought it was going to turn into

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
something you could actually use

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,519
right in a in a wider set than just a

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
sort of random little other it's crazy

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
side project

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,799
oh yeah i know but i think ultimately

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
you know

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
not only the fact that it's you know it

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
costs less than you know like a

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
full-blown oscilloscope-based setup and

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
so on but um

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,760
i think what would what makes it um a

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
success is also the fact that it's like

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
kind of like this closed package you

125
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
know it comes with your youtube videos

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
uh tons of example code and you know if

127
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
you

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
if if you'd go if i gave you a hundred

129
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,720
thousand dollars and said okay go off

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
and buy an oscilloscope and buy a pc and

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
you know buy some cables and buy some

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
stuff um

133
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
you still wouldn't have you know the

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
video that tells you okay plug this

135
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
cable here plug that cable there you now

136
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,919
you need to write some code that will

137
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,440
actually talk to the thing and all of

138
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
this right so for you it's

139
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,500
um yeah it's a more integrated um

140
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,840
[Music]

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
solution right and therefore much easier

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
to start with

143
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,639
yeah that was one of the other

144
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,040
interesting things too when i so uh like

145
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
my background right i was starting my

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,720
introduction to security really came

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
from working in um zigbee ip and some

148
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
other wireless protocol specs and like

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
literally so you know when you look at

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
protocol specs you're like what are

151
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,919
these engineers thinking with this

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
security like this isn't this makes no

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,639
sense

154
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
um you know i was part of that this

155
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
makes no sense before so you know we're

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
in a room talking about how should we do

157
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
you know ecc signature and there's like

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
guys on wikipedia looking up ecc and

159
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
people pulling the example c code from

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,160
that to do a quick test with um

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
so to me the other thing was for

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
engineers to you know believe that it

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
was a real attack you wanted something

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
that you could just say like okay here

165
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
you know you can set this up in

166
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,479
a few hours

167
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,440
and get going and see a an attack work

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
which is kind of one of the original

169
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,479
goals too was to sort of convince people

170
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
like me before i got into this that it's

171
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
a real thing

172
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,039
excellent so by the way um a note for

173
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,479
the audience which i forgot to mention

174
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
in the beginning i should have done that

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
um if you have any questions for colin

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,639
or any comments on what i'm saying or

177
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
what he's saying

178
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,720
you can either raise your hand

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,400
you can do that by clicking on the

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
reaction button that's on the bottom of

181
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,759
your screen there's about reactions and

182
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,759
then there's a button raised hand

183
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
and if you do that um i'll i'll see that

184
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,240
because you're gonna move up in the

185
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
participants list um to the top and then

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
i can

187
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,960
i'll

188
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
name you and then you can unmute and

189
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
just ask a question or if if you want um

190
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,360
to write it in the chat then please use

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
the zoom chat because i'm unable to

192
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,919
monitor the participants list and the

193
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,840
zoom chat and the zulu chat so um

194
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
either yeah raise your hand or write it

195
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,880
into the chat piece

196
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
okay so um

197
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,960
okay so

198
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
you've been now building just chip

199
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,680
whisperer versions i think for um

200
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
i don't know somewhere between five and

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
ten years is that's correct

202
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
yeah i'd have to look at get something

203
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
like that like six seven years i think

204
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
was the initial one

205
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
right so how many how many different

206
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
versions do we have today

207
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
uh so there's

208
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
in like including prototype probably

209
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
four or five maybe a few more

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
um but the main like the the light

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
version we've now shipped a few thousand

212
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
of them so it started for sure as like

213
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
hey there might be 10 people that want

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
to use this thing right yeah yeah

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,759
i remember it was it was a

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
kickstarter thing right in the beginning

217
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
yeah and that was the first uh and there

218
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
there was i forget how many people

219
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
several hundred um

220
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
that you know were interested enough in

221
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,759
it to back it so that was kind of the

222
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
first belief that it could be something

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,440
larger well the numbers prove you're

224
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
right huh yeah yeah we're still here so

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
so what's coming next so we're waiting

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
for chippers for husky

227
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
yeah so this was um and i don't know how

228
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
people integrated are in the supply

229
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
chains but things have gotten pretty

230
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
crazy with getting parts

231
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
um

232
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
so this was a project that basically is

233
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,879
a feature upgrade so using like a seven

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,360
series fpga and adding a bunch of stuff

235
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
um

236
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
but it's become tricky to get parts so

237
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,000
like a lot of stuff that we're supposed

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
to have delivered i ordered in march

239
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,599
was supposed to be delivered in

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,879
september and now they're telling me

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,560
march 2022

242
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
uh for fpga so there's a lot of interest

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
in that

244
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
um

245
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
you know

246
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
to before the release so there's a lot

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,199
of

248
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
kind of problems with supply chain so

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,599
i'm hoping to have that out um soon but

250
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,199
it'll be sort of like an upgrade to the

251
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
chip whisper light is the idea

252
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah yeah yeah shortage of chips that's

253
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
um at least at least do you have a

254
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
number i think yeah we also had a number

255
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
but it was like uh yeah 72 weeks or

256
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,279
something

257
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,080
time

258
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
stm parts

259
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
i forgot what it was it was some

260
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
leonard broke some power regulator the

261
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
other day like kind of you know over

262
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
torturing it and it's actually it's

263
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
actually just some some voltage

264
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
regulator but it has to be that one and

265
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
yeah

266
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
it's gonna be a while

267
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
for parts to come so what are there any

268
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
other new toys

269
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
you know at least well maybe in your

270
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
head in the pipeline

271
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
yeah i think there's always too many

272
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
going on in

273
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
if people look at sometimes you'll see

274
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,399
references to things that didn't exist

275
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,839
yet so uh

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
there was going to be an xy table and

277
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
some of this now with supply chain

278
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
issues so we had an xy table design that

279
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,200
there's actually um designs out there

280
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,399
for now

281
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
uh chip shover i think that's like a few

282
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
years old um

283
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
yeah normally i'll have some name and an

284
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,120
idea for it right and announce it and

285
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,959
then it may or may not exist in the next

286
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,518
year or two

287
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
if it's ready designed then why not you

288
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,240
know

289
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
um just announce it see if people go for

290
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
it yeah yeah that's i mean so for this

291
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
one um it's

292
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
i think it's i forget how much i pushed

293
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
out already um

294
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
but it was sort of a supply issue so it

295
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
uses some of the microchip

296
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
devices that are used in one of the

297
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
arduinos and that ends up being really

298
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,800
hard right now to get parts for so i

299
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
don't know we kind of not mothballed it

300
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
fully but pushes it to the side to work

301
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
on stuff we can get

302
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
where you get where you can get parts

303
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
yeah exactly so so that's that's

304
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,519
non-electronics like what what are you

305
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,440
doing car mechanic so what are you doing

306
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
no no where we can get electronic parts

307
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
so um

308
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
okay

309
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
so there is still some stuff we can get

310
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
but i mean anyone involved in r d2 i'm

311
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
sure sees this that it's very

312
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
frustrating because you know like this

313
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,040
voltage regulator so it's like hey let

314
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
me design something okay i can't test it

315
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
um

316
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
so yeah so it'll be interesting in the

317
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
industry like an electronic side what's

318
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,399
gonna happen to all these small

319
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,040
companies that can't get parts

320
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
yeah yeah it's gonna take a year

321
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
something to recover i guess

322
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
yeah well hopefully just the year we'll

323
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
see great

324
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,880
all right so i have a couple of

325
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
questions for you in the chat so i'm

326
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,040
going to

327
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
um

328
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
detour and take those

329
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
and there's one question from muammar

330
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
who asks what in your experience is the

331
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
most successful technique to analyze or

332
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
break security protocols

333
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
um so this i mean i think if you're at

334
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
chess everyone's going to say power

335
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
analysis

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
that's probably and that's probably the

337
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,519
most

338
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:13,760
you interesting

339
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,839
maybe fault injection will get thrown in

340
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
of course with ches um

341
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
but and this was so a good example there

342
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,360
was some of the bootloader protocols a

343
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
lot of them using

344
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
encryption nowadays right so it's like a

345
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
pretty textbook example of using power

346
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,079
analysis um to break some of these

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,680
things because they'll typically have a

348
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
fixed key

349
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,959
on these small devices right that

350
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,480
they'll just share amongst a whole bunch

351
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,839
of them

352
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
and their power analysis makes like a

353
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,279
really nice solution for it because you

354
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
can sort of recover the key and get

355
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
everything back out of it

356
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
all right and there's another question

357
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
from from junebang who asks will there

358
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
be a new ae tool

359
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
for micro architectural side channel

360
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,639
analysis

361
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
yeah probably not um so i

362
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
that that's one thing i barely know

363
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
about um

364
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
actually so

365
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
uh jasper van windberg had been writing

366
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,320
this no search book on hardware hacking

367
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
and this was another like long delayed

368
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
project that's now coming out in

369
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,800
november

370
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
but it was we started it we had to look

371
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,160
back like five or six years ago um

372
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
you know and it talked about side

373
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
channels and like five or six years ago

374
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
side channels

375
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
were pretty simple

376
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,959
um so in the interleaving time there's

377
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
of course been all these new attacks

378
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
including like specter meltdown and then

379
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
we're like ah you know if we're

380
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
releasing a book and we talk about side

381
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,519
channels we have to at least mention

382
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,320
microarchitectural side channels and

383
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,839
things like that so i think we have like

384
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
a paragraph on them that's the extent of

385
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
my

386
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
my knowledge

387
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
all right so there's not going to be any

388
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,200
tools anytime soon

389
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,720
although you know with another lockdown

390
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,639
maybe you have some time to study up and

391
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
then

392
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
yeah we'll see

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,440
all right uh kevin do you have a

394
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
question

395
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,639
yeah i have a question uh i'm a little

396
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,320
curious if you've thought about changing

397
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
sides in other words instead of trying

398
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
to design tools for attacking systems

399
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
trying to design more secure

400
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,120
hardware

401
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,760
for cryptographic functionality

402
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,680
yeah it's not as fun right that's i

403
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,399
think

404
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
the summary of it

405
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,800
um

406
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
which i mean is is interesting because

407
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,680
in the classic uh you know academia

408
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,639
um

409
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,680
sort of

410
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,839
look academia versus industry discussion

411
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
industry of course looks a lot at people

412
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
expect you to have counter measures

413
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
people expect you to be

414
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,199
licensing them some great solution to

415
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
this problem

416
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,800
um so i think at one point i think i'm

417
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
still using it actually we use the

418
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
slogan of embedded security arsonists

419
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,160
because it's like we're working on tools

420
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
that help you understand the problems uh

421
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,199
but there's no solution there's no that

422
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
i i deal with really right so it's not

423
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,199
like okay here's the problem and here's

424
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
the perfect solution that's gonna save

425
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,519
you

426
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,800
if you pay us the nice license fee um so

427
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
it's just step one there is no step two

428
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,479
that i've been involved with yet

429
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
but you do help people right i mean you

430
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
do have people evaluating their own

431
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
designs

432
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,440
i understand you also you work you go

433
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
around 15 i mean you teach right you

434
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,160
give you demos you get training

435
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
and i i guess a fair share of that is

436
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
also

437
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
yeah with with people who whose ultimate

438
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
goal is to get you know to improve the

439
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
security of their own implementation

440
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
site

441
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
exactly so i mean i think and that's the

442
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,800
point is that

443
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
it is um you know there's there is

444
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
obviously solutions right there ever and

445
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
this is what chess half of chess is

446
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,040
about at least um

447
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
and for me it's making people aware of

448
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,959
problems um

449
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
and it's just i've never gotten involved

450
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,519
in the other half of it um

451
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,760
there's i guess so much time that you

452
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
can do on this stuff so for me working

453
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,480
on

454
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
making the attacks more accessible is

455
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
kind of the more interesting side of it

456
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,279
all right

457
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,760
um there's a next question

458
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
on the new ae cw305 board i have the

459
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,079
program that previous instructions

460
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,279
strongly influenced the power

461
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
consumption of the current instructions

462
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
for example over a period of three

463
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,399
milliseconds

464
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,000
since i lack an electric engineering

465
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,760
background can you elaborate where this

466
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
comes from capacitors i guess

467
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
and what can be done to reduce the

468
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,480
influence practically and theoretically

469
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
yeah that's very specific

470
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,639
yeah since we free support too that's

471
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
the other use of this

472
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
um

473
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
i mean and i think people will have seen

474
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,639
this on other

475
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
uh things in general right this sounds a

476
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,399
lot like power distribution network um

477
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
is sort of you know slow to respond to

478
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
the

479
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
um

480
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
slow to respond to some power

481
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
consumption on one clock cycle um which

482
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
could be you know you would classically

483
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
think capacitors but probably what i

484
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,920
suspect in that case is like the

485
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,519
switching regulator that's backed a

486
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,839
little further um

487
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
it is actually still having some effect

488
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
like some rain or something like that um

489
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
so it may actually be mounting some

490
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
level of capacitors would help reduce

491
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
that uh because on that board by default

492
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
there is no decoupling capacitors on the

493
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
power rail um so you could be seeing

494
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
effects from like the you know there's a

495
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
filter and things like that after the

496
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
power supply um

497
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,519
yeah i think that's one of those like

498
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
experimentation needed

499
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,279
would be the the best choice

500
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,839
all right i think a pragmatic

501
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,519
solution could also be just to run at a

502
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,959
slower clock speed right and you know

503
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
let it let it decay out before

504
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
yeah three milliseconds though that's

505
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,730
pretty uh

506
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,880
[Laughter]

507
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,199
like three kilohertz one kilo yeah

508
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
yeah you're into static power analysis i

509
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,240
think then

510
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
long traces

511
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
all right um

512
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
another question

513
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,839
um

514
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,680
when do you plan releasing updated

515
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,799
template attack tutorials

516
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
yeah it could ask a good question

517
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
actually that's um

518
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,679
one of the ongoing

519
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,280
ongoing things so

520
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,599
uh we had done an update so i think

521
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,799
people that might have used tripwish for

522
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
a long time ago there was a gui and

523
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
things like that um

524
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
so richard a plan i i don't know what

525
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
happened to it to port them to the

526
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,359
jupiter notebook our new system and

527
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
yeah it never happened that's a good i

528
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,120
kind of forgot about that so and there's

529
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
no excuse about missing parts here

530
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
yeah

531
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
one of many things that gets kind of

532
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,799
like pushed to the side and forgotten

533
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
all right um

534
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,120
so you you already briefly touched on it

535
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
um so here's the hardware hacking

536
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
handbook

537
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
tell us a little bit about this one

538
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,080
yeah so this was um a book so it started

539
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,640
out as a a larger book talking about

540
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,840
hardware hacking

541
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,360
um in its uh entirety right so like rf

542
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
hacking all sorts of stuff um so there's

543
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
more authors involved because that's a

544
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
lot of this isn't my area

545
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
and

546
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
eventually it became i mean anyone

547
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
anyone who's written a book has always

548
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
told me that you know you're you're

549
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
better off getting a job at subway if

550
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
you're doing this for money like the

551
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,360
amount of time it's going to take is

552
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,679
crazy um

553
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
which was true absolutely true but it

554
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
was a lot of fun uh but it turned out

555
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
you know doing a book with that many

556
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,120
people became problematic um so it was

557
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,679
already pretty slow uh then jasper and i

558
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,919
were able to slowly over the course of

559
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
years just mostly concentrate on side

560
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
channel and fault injection um there is

561
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
a bit of you know everything else

562
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
involved in in getting started

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
um

564
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
and part of sort of where we saw it fizz

565
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
i mean i think everyone has surely you

566
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
know read the the classic blue book um

567
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
attacking smart cards that sort of how i

568
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
learned about this um so we also wanted

569
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,919
to have sort of what we saw as a bit of

570
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
a compliment to that sort of book as

571
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
getting started in you know side channel

572
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
but also adding a bit of fault injection

573
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,960
um as well at a you know very

574
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
introduction someone that hasn't done

575
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,240
this before um can get some basic stuff

576
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,679
up and running you know do some timing

577
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,000
attacks uh through power do some you

578
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
know attacks on aes um as well as some

579
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,080
basic glitch attacks and and then

580
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
looking at some real devices so

581
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
so it was a lot of fun um

582
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
i'll let you know if it weren't worth

583
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,919
like a few beers or anything what you

584
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,559
end up getting out of writing a book but

585
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,679
everyone told me not expect much

586
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
well in terms of money

587
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,039
yeah

588
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
probably all right next question um

589
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,840
how often would you see fancy or

590
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
advanced physical attacks that were

591
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,440
actually carried out against real world

592
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,240
applications and and do you worry about

593
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
the latest attacks that are discussed in

594
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,600
academia

595
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
or are they actually too sophisticated

596
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
and too complicated to be applied in

597
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
real life

598
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
um yeah so that's a good question right

599
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,840
and that's

600
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
interesting uh because this is the

601
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
classic like when people look at um you

602
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
know industry or attacks and academia

603
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
and say could this apply you know to

604
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
some device should i care about this

605
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
um

606
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
and it depends on really what the

607
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
kind of level not level sophistication

608
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,799
of the attacker but what incentive there

609
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,600
is um and the other thing i see is that

610
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
you know the fancy attacks become less

611
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
fancy over time

612
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
so what you're talking about is fancy

613
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
now in five years which is a pretty

614
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,679
common life cycle for even like an iot

615
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,440
device right let alone automotive

616
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
is

617
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
pretty reasonable so um

618
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,679
if you think about what you know is

619
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
quite advanced now um

620
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
it becomes i think reasonable you know

621
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,559
maybe in five years 10 years 20 years um

622
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
which is why it's important to you know

623
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,799
even consider those threats even if you

624
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,840
want to say it's out of scope um but you

625
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
know there's a really nice paper on the

626
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,600
um

627
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
google titan so the this was and the

628
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
titan being the proprietary not

629
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,000
proprietary the uh sort of repackaged

630
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
nxp microcontroller so i think was

631
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,120
called like a side channel journey to

632
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
um titan

633
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
i want to get the actual title

634
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
um and this was a really good example of

635
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
like you know a classically very

636
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
complicated attack um there was a lot of

637
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
work but was very much you know

638
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,799
reasonable you could see someone

639
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,600
applying this um in a sort of

640
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
offensive environment because it wasn't

641
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
uh ridiculous you know the level of

642
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,158
equipment required

643
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,360
yeah side journey to titan that was it

644
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,320
yeah

645
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
yeah i think the

646
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
yeah what i mean it was probably hard

647
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
work to find the attack but then once

648
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,159
you have it like you know applying it

649
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,679
it's it's largely about getting good

650
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,880
traces huh

651
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
yeah exactly so there's another question

652
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
from a user to your support team

653
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
recently i ran into a case where i

654
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
needed to record both the beginning and

655
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,440
the end of the trace which would not fit

656
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
into the five thousand points buffer of

657
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
the chip wrister

658
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,919
i found a workaround i found a

659
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,120
workaround

660
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
but do you have any plan of having a

661
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
more fine-grained trigger control

662
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,440
like being able to precise the cycle

663
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
ranges where the power whether should be

664
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
stored

665
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,840
or is the solution simply just to buy

666
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,679
the chip with performance

667
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
um yeah so the quick answer to that the

668
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
chippers for pro won't solve the

669
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
solution because it also doesn't have

670
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,360
any different triggering um the light

671
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
and pro so for for reference one of the

672
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,080
ideas of the architectures is they share

673
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
a lot of the same code and the fpga is

674
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
open in both of them and things like

675
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,559
that

676
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,440
um there is a beta feature in the light

677
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
that i think was turned on at one point

678
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,559
um so send me a message um

679
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,400
offline and i can give you that where

680
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
the trigger itself the the recording

681
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
feature will follow the trigger

682
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,799
um so you can record just when the

683
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,320
trigger's active but yeah send me a note

684
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,159
about that

685
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,960
all right

686
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,520
uh kevin

687
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,360
yeah i just wanted to make a comment in

688
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,960
response to something you said earlier

689
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,559
about sort of the

690
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
the dedication of the attacker and

691
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,799
what's the what's the incentive for the

692
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,880
attacker and i think there's been a

693
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
recent event where a lot of military

694
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
hardware was captured for example

695
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
and in the case when you want to uh

696
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,679
issue an arming or disarming command to

697
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,360
something it might be worth a lot of

698
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,799
effort to go and

699
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
and investigate the hardware to see what

700
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
kind of attacks you can mount against

701
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
especially if you can come across one

702
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,400
later on

703
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
okay yeah that's a good point right and

704
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
i mean and that might be a good example

705
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
where you expected

706
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
you know not to have so much equipment

707
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
fall into enemy hands for

708
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
uh

709
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,440
quite a while um

710
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,799
so yeah i guess the other thing is

711
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,320
always of course if your threat model is

712
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,679
wrong

713
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,440
what does that mean so

714
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
that's a really good point

715
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,039
yeah and it can vary greatly right

716
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,039
hacking a little iot sensor or having

717
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,760
some

718
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,159
i don't know big military arms right so

719
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,600
um

720
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
i have two topics which i um definitely

721
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
still wanted to touch upon

722
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,039
um

723
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
the first one is bam bam

724
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,400
so what's up with them you know emfiring

725
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
car electronics

726
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,640
in c2 on the go

727
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
yeah uh so this is an actually i i have

728
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
a shorter demo

729
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
uh not not related to the the attack i

730
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,559
did on an ecu but doing emi for safety

731
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
where i started doing it uh in a car not

732
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
when i'm on the road but at least in a

733
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,520
full car

734
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
um

735
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
which has been interesting but yeah the

736
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,840
bam bam this is actually a good example

737
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,080
so i did some work uh talked about a

738
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
black hat this year looking at ecu's

739
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,360
using emfi to unlock an ecu

740
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,240
which is financially very you know

741
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
there's a strong incentive because

742
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
cartooners will pay good money to get

743
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,480
unlocked ecu's um which is one of these

744
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
examples where it's like there actually

745
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,720
is a pretty good incentive and if you

746
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
could make a work benchable you know

747
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,600
like make just a really automated attack

748
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,279
um it's a much it's quite a you know

749
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
powerful threat i want to say because

750
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
um there's people that are going to be

751
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
really interested in it so

752
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,200
um this is sort of an example i was

753
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
trying to push where it's people will

754
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
think emfi uh that's just you know some

755
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,080
academics are going to do that in a lab

756
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
or some test labs going to do that

757
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
and if you can show that in fact no you

758
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
could make it fairly generic

759
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
you don't need a ton of expertise to run

760
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
the attack right once it's designed

761
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,640
um it sort of opens up the the you know

762
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,880
the threat model to a pretty wide area

763
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,320
the pointer was kind of say you know if

764
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
you're designing these systems now

765
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
this is definitely something that i

766
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,279
would consider is going to be used by

767
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
you know cartooners and other oh yeah

768
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,240
right yeah so funny so right if you

769
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
remember that in the in the beginning i

770
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,039
asked you whether you were switching to

771
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,640
car mechanics so you know there's

772
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,279
actually some connection here right so

773
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,799
you're gonna sell like you're gonna sell

774
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,799
like little tuning boxes you know just

775
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
you know just you know

776
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
open the hood plug this here plug that

777
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,679
there push the button magic that's the

778
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,640
backup so if chip whisperer fails

779
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,120
if you go to dark okay yeah and i know i

780
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,400
know quite some people that would

781
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
probably be interested in that so but so

782
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
you have like working examples of you

783
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
know in in situ

784
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
fault injection without damaging the

785
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,440
rest of it

786
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,200
yeah so i mean when it was doing etc i

787
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,520
mean it's it's out of the car in situ is

788
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,559
like it's in the uh the ecu itself

789
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
basically um because so one of the

790
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,640
things with some of the newer ecu's uh

791
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,960
was people were looking at on an attack

792
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,799
were they reballing were they physically

793
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,679
removing a bga to replace it you know to

794
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
to get the tune to work to bypass the

795
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
security um

796
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,880
and the point was if you could do it by

797
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
just pulling the ecu you know putting it

798
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,360
on the bench having the emf i over it um

799
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,679
then that's a pretty you know dangerous

800
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
threat model because that becomes

801
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
actually something people will use for

802
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
sure right it's it's not like uh

803
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
it's much easier than rebuilding the

804
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,919
people

805
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,799
yeah

806
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,159
that was that was my point so you wanted

807
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,520
basically to prove that you can do it

808
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,120
without you know

809
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,039
disordering it putting it somewhere else

810
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,600
and then later reboiling it

811
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,679
which yeah i guess is also a fairly

812
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
complicated process right that

813
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
is error thrown

814
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
yeah exactly but but i mean i think

815
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,279
people have been doing that for tuning

816
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,000
is kind of what it had appeared like um

817
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
because it's possible and you know you

818
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,559
can

819
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,559
make it work so

820
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
oh yeah yeah and i i cannot i can

821
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,399
perfectly see that there's gonna be some

822
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,360
strong motivation and uh interest and

823
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
for some people in doing that

824
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,799
all right so the other topic i wanted to

825
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,200
briefly touch on is academia your

826
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
academic life um right so you

827
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,080
i think you are still or at least you

828
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
were professor at dalhousie universe

829
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
um no

830
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,640
so that's

831
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
uh no so that was a and this was

832
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,919
actually a good topic when we might run

833
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,360
out of time to really get into it it's

834
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
going to trigger everyone right um so i

835
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,799
was a professor assistant professor

836
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,880
at tallahassee so i stepped down as of

837
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
like beginning of september

838
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
um i think i'm still adjunct so they

839
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,600
never let you go right you're always

840
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,440
involved in some commitments

841
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,840
um so the more accurate term now i guess

842
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
is right i'm doing some of the academic

843
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
life without getting paid by the

844
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
university um

845
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,720
is what ended up happening but this was

846
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
a bit of a

847
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,000
question over time and i think a lot of

848
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
people will sort of resonate with that

849
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,919
is you know the point academia to me is

850
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,440
to do work that

851
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
um maybe an industry wasn't or not the

852
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,559
point of academia but one value i see is

853
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,679
you know to do work that an industry

854
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,760
doesn't have the value so when we look

855
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,559
at security attacks on devices

856
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,480
sometimes you think you know it's not

857
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,240
worthwhile doing the attacks but it's

858
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
good to point out what's possible um

859
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
and to me that's you know really

860
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
academia that as well as sort of

861
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,880
teaching the next generation

862
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,679
um and for a while i was sort of asked

863
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,240
the question at least where i was in the

864
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,679
institute

865
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,279
of um you know

866
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,039
is that really what i'm spending a lot

867
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
of the time doing um and for me it sort

868
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
of seemed like a lot of time was also

869
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
spent on you know logistics and academia

870
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
of grants and

871
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,760
sort of

872
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,360
um the

873
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
the university of course has an

874
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,000
incentive to keep going and to

875
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,399
increase you know costs to students it

876
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
felt like so in sort of achieving my

877
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
goals of

878
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
doing the sort of interesting work

879
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
making things accessible it actually

880
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,000
felt like i was better doing that via

881
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,720
the quasi industry route so i switched

882
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,480
back i'm still someone involved

883
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,120
officially in the university um

884
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,039
in practice i suspect a lot of what i'm

885
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,200
gonna do is the same right like a lot of

886
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,640
the work i've done

887
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
i've tried to push as much open source

888
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
um as i can because i felt like that was

889
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,480
a really good way to reach that sort of

890
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,080
teaching you know level of of things

891
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,039
um

892
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,159
but yeah but the question of you know

893
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
what's the the vessel to do that is sort

894
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,480
of a good one is it academia

895
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
classically right is it

896
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
some weird hybrid is it research

897
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,919
institutes

898
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
um i don't have a good answer to that

899
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
well i guess i guess it can be both

900
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
right so i mean

901
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
um

902
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
and then it then really depends what you

903
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
do

904
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
so i can perfectly i know right that

905
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,440
your work on the industry side

906
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,000
um has has huge impact on on the

907
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
academic side on you know from people

908
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
teaching these sort of things in class

909
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,000
because now it's easy to do you know

910
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,520
hands-on exercises and tutorials or

911
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,200
more master thesis on the topic right

912
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
you can just give some student a chipper

913
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,679
set up to take home and experiment with

914
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,480
it

915
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,279
so

916
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,480
you're definitely influencing the

917
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
academic side also

918
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,720
yeah from your industry position

919
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,840
um

920
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,240
so do you still supervise some students

921
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,000
or is that all

922
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,200
closed now

923
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
no not right now um at least not

924
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,279
directly so i'm on some committees and

925
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,279
things like that but okay you're taking

926
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,600
your students if anyone's interested

927
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,679
not right now i mean i'm i theoretically

928
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,480
i think i can so let me know uh if if

929
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,320
people are um and that was the other

930
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,240
thing too i realized is you know it was

931
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,279
harder to find uh where i was physically

932
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,120
as many students that were interested in

933
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
this area

934
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
versus i think if you're at a you know

935
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
institute that i've realized the value

936
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
in the structures right um if someone's

937
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,559
at okay you luvin like you know you're

938
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,480
getting very interested students in the

939
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,919
area that already have a good background

940
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,360
in side channel

941
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,919
versus kind of trying to pull people

942
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,640
that maybe aren't as into the area no

943
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,480
you still have to build it up huh yeah

944
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,760
yeah yeah so in the opening remarks

945
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,559
um

946
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
earlier today right there was this the

947
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,000
world map

948
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
with the participant numbers kind of

949
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,039
yeah

950
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
where you are is let's say not not the

951
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
brightest spot

952
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
right so i can i can i can perfectly

953
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
understand that it's hard

954
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
to um

955
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
to ideally find people you know who

956
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,919
already know a little something

957
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,159
for interested and so kevin you have

958
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,760
another question

959
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,519
yeah i guess i have a question um

960
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,960
touching on

961
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,039
guidance for people following you who

962
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,279
want to do future work are there

963
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,200
do you think it's more lucrative to go

964
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,039
look at what not lucrative but more um

965
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,880
of an opportunity to go look at new

966
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
kinds of devices or new kinds of attacks

967
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,600
do you have any kind of a other kind of

968
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
side channel attacks that you think

969
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,760
might be worth exploring or different

970
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
kinds of devices to explore which would

971
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
you suggest

972
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
yeah yeah that's an interesting question

973
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
actually um you know and i think

974
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
the the sort of there's always a lot of

975
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,120
luck in life is uh the way i see it and

976
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,640
it's a bit of luck of having sort of a

977
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,880
background of being uh

978
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,200
able to see where things are going um so

979
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,799
for me starting chip whisperer that was

980
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
like okay you know my background in sort

981
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
of embedded design was like oh the

982
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
problem of designing the measurement

983
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
stuff is not

984
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
super difficult for me but if you don't

985
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,440
have that background it's going to be

986
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
kind of you know out of reach so

987
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,559
um i think looking at

988
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
you know areas or devices where you

989
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,240
don't see as much work

990
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,799
is pretty interesting so um as an

991
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,960
example on the fault injection side

992
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
uh the

993
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,039
bbi body biasing injection um you know

994
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,559
that was introduced in 2012

995
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
i think was the first workout i'm just

996
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
going by memory here

997
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,880
um and there's a few papers on it um

998
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
right and it looked like it could be

999
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
quite valuable but it sort of never

1000
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,640
seemed to go too much further

1001
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,159
so i had designed a little bbi probe um

1002
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,440
that i pushed out and actually then i

1003
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,279
saw on twitter some other people using

1004
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,880
it and for example they had like milled

1005
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,279
away the back of an ic to do bbi which

1006
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,559
was pretty interesting because they had

1007
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
just used like a desktop mill um and

1008
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,120
because you're going through the back

1009
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
side you have you know pretty thick

1010
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,600
uh wafer which you you have before you

1011
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
hit the ic

1012
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
um so i think there is

1013
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,640
sort of one of those things where you

1014
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,720
can often find areas that

1015
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080
haven't had as much work right there

1016
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
might have been initial work there and

1017
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,879
it's sort of for whatever reason there's

1018
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,639
so much going on that there's only so

1019
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,159
many people doing this

1020
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,000
um you can find some interesting areas

1021
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,399
and often that'll kick off you know new

1022
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,560
people interested in this is sort of

1023
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,839

1024
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,199
