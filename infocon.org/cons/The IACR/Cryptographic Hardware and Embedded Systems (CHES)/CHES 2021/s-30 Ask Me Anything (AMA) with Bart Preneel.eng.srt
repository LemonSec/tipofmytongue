1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,319
okay you're good to go have a good

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,720
session okay thank you so much

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
so welcome everybody to the friday

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
morning at least european time um friday

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,920
morning

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
session asked me anything

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
of chess 2021 and it's my uh great honor

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,400
and pleasure to introduce bart grenell

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,560
who i'm sure everybody knows in this

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,519
room

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
and yeah so what what we plan to do

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
is um

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,960
30 minutes of q a you know it's your

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
once in your lifetime chance to

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
talk to famous bald

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,280
um

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
and you can

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
for me it would actually be the easiest

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
if people post your question either in

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
the zoom chat room here

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,039
um

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,879
but also you can speak up which is great

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,680
and makes it quite lively so if you

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,160
if you dare to just to speak up here in

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,480
the zoom room that would be a great and

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,079
you can

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,559
also show your picture and open up your

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
video if you want to

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
yeah but maybe to get started um i asked

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
maybe bart you want to say a few words

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,680
about your relationship to chess

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
of course so

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,799
many people don't know but i actually

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,080
have a background in electrical

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,759
engineering and i studied quite some

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
hardware design

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
but then i did a phd this is in

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
cryptography

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
um

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
and then actually in the late 90s i had

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
a student looking at my door

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
who was kind of was working in a

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,240
hardware center but she kind of her pd

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,159
process didn't continue properly and she

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,759
asked her i wanted to supervise her work

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,960
on

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
hardware in fact with her we started to

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,320
do side channel analysis

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
so then we submitted paper to

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
chess 2003 i think that was my first

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,920
chess

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
and since then i really liked it but i

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,799
also have to point out that actually in

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
the my first ici conference in late 80s

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
and early 90s there were actually

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
hardware papers in

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
the euro crypts and the cryptos but

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
somehow everything got more competitive

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
and shifts a bit more towards theory and

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,239
i think i guess that motivated um the

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,239
symmetrical people to start i see in the

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
early 90s and i guess christoph and

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
jacob and others to start chess in the

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
late 90s

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
and so but since 1903 i've been actually

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
do a lot of chances because i really

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
like the conference

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
because of course it's hardware which is

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
something i always was trained and i

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
really like very much but also i think

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
the topics are very varied and they deal

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
with many new developments

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
unlike invited talks on a broad range of

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
topics i find it very interesting always

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,519
a very enriching conference

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,720
also i'd like to work a lot with

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
industry and of course at chess people

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
i've

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,440
worked with or we have experience with

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
or collaborated with they tend to come

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
to chess i guess more now than to europe

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
what was the case in the 90s

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,000
yeah yeah thank you so much yeah and um

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
maybe a few words about me and

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
me and bart bart and me i started doing

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
crypto in in early 95 also my my phd was

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
in a different area and bath's name of

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,560
course came up right away like probably

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
the first week i started you know

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
looking in conference proceedings about

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
was quite famous already back then and

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
um

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
since uh

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,959
bart mentioned the the uh his history of

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
chess and how it relates to crypto by

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
the way i'm wearing a hostile t-shirt

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
here so this is crypto

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
2015 um

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,400
but was very very helpful um to get

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
chess included in the ircr family which

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,720
is something that wasn't clear around

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
the turn of the millennium right they

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
were like the crazy hardware people

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,640
doing their stuff and this is something

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
maybe that iscr doesn't want to want to

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
touch and now it's it's uh quite the

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
opposite you know i see our people are

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
very welcoming to our weird applied

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
crypto stuff and so forth so and this is

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,319
all all thanks to bart

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
so he um did not only do a lot of good

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
things for the crypto community at large

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
but also to the chess community in fact

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,599
yeah so

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
with these words i would like to um

116
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
open up

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
um

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,599
the podium and helena has the first

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,959
question

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
crazy hardware people she says yeah

121
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
i'm actually i'm sure that was partly am

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
i also an electrical engineer by

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
training as some people know and

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,919
probably some other people in this room

125
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,720
too

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
yeah so if you have questions you know

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
please feel um

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,919
feel free to

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,719
to speak up

130
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,160
i asked maybe bought my my first

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,199
question

132
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,840
so um

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
what um

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,400
how do you see that development of chess

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
relatively to um crypt and eurocrypt

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
because when i started attending krypton

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
eurocrypt actually there was more

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
applied stuff

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
and i think in the beginning there was a

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
more stricter separation between you

141
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
know cryptographic algorithms that is

142
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
something that happened at uh crypt and

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
eurocrypt and then chess is essentially

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
the implementation people

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,800
and now the boundary has has shifted i

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
think you know crypto neurocrypt in one

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
direction and we do also more

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
crypto algorithms

149
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
i would be interested to hear your

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,600
thoughts which which role may be chess

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
plays in the cryptographic universe

152
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
well what i like about topic of

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
cryptography is that it's very broad and

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
it goes from mathematics and theory to

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
implementations i think it's very nice

156
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,280
that there is a close connection between

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,400
the two

158
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,520
and we

159
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,039
come up with crazy things in research

160
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
and it turns out that actually these

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
things are

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
very practical and are

163
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
can be widely deployed

164
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
and so i think that's interesting and

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
it's very valuable to have these two

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
communities

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,000
talk together

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
i guess

169
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
it's very important to to keep them

170
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,800
together and keep talking to each other

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
i think if we could rewind would be

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,880
probably better to have

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
a few big conferences per year where

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
everybody meets um local reasons we've

175
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,199
actually split up and i think of course

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
we do have a very nice event

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
but i think if you look for the future

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
and

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
i guess we'll have to also do our

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
contribution to traveling less and i

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
guess we can choose to either sit more

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
in zoom rooms or maybe actually have

183
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
fewer bigger events where everybody can

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
meet and can interact and i would really

185
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
highly value that i think that's

186
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,199
something

187
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,960
really would be very valuable to have

188
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
this and what i like about chess is that

189
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,199
it's very good at picking up new

190
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
developments and following what's

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,680
happening

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
of course

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
hardware has become more important in

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
cryptography maybe that's also something

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
that is logic if you look at the history

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
of chess

197
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
of course in the beginning cryptography

198
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,560
was only done in hardware because it was

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,199
too expensive for software and maybe i

200
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,319
should be mentioned maybe people don't

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,599
know this but ron rivest actually

202
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
published several papers at cryptos in

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,039
the 80s trying to design rsa hardware

204
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
as far as i know he never succeeded to

205
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
make rsa hardware work because the tools

206
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
were not available to do it it was not

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
of course one is very smart but i guess

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,680
the tools were not capable of dealing

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
with rsa in the mid 80s that was a

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
challenge

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
and then in the 90s we realized you

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
could do crypto in software but of

213
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,880
course then um crypto moved back to

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,039
hardware and got a lot of crypto in

215
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,000
hardware and now if you buy a processor

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
it has uh aes instructions it i guess it

217
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,039
will be more support for cryptography

218
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,039
we've had secure processors so i think

219
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
there is a natural marriage between

220
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,960
photography moving back to hardware and

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,639
doing also research that takes us into

222
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,199
account in the models

223
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,880
so that i do therefore it's very

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
important to keep the two communities

225
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
together and to learn from each other

226
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,919
i also like very much specialized

227
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
workshops where you can discuss among

228
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,440
experts i think it's also very nice we

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
have a broader community where

230
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
we can learn from each other what the

231
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
developments are and where things are

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
heading

233
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,879
yeah well thank you these are very

234
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,199
valuable thoughts and i think

235
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
also some people in this room might know

236
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
that but many not so bad was also

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
instrumental to um

238
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
we had for several

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
years we had chess co-located with

240
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
crypto and santa barbara and i think

241
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
this this was based on ideas of bar to

242
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
get the communities together and it

243
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,199
it worked okay i would say it wasn't

244
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,319
maybe it

245
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
wasn't the greatest successes

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
interacting but it also wasn't a failure

247
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
and we should continue working on that

248
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
so the first questions are coming in i'm

249
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,120
reading the first question from helena

250
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
any predictions on the future

251
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,200
intersection between crypto analysis and

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
such general attacks

253
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,080
very broad philosophical questions yeah

254
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
guys i think that there is actually

255
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,120
a strong potential for for more new

256
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
ideas and improvements

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
i mean of course the first side

258
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
challenge actually a very simple

259
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
statistics and if you now look at a

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,920
chess you see that side channel attacks

261
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
use much more advanced and complex

262
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
statistics and we also see deep learning

263
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,720
being used so much more complex analysis

264
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
but i think on the other hand of course

265
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
what you do is you obtain some

266
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
information on some specific cipher and

267
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
if you can use the structure of the

268
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
cipher as well

269
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,839
to improve the attack

270
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
then you can definitely further improve

271
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,040
sidechain analysis or better understand

272
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,399
your country measures i think there have

273
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,040
been some papers that try to um

274
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,120
combine these two fields and to actually

275
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
use more complete techniques inside

276
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,959
channel attacks but i think this is

277
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,080
definitely something where further

278
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
improvement can be made but of course it

279
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
makes sense first to do the easy way but

280
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
i think as defenses get better as

281
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
counterweights get better this is indeed

282
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
an area where there is potential so i

283
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
would recommend side channel people to

284
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
study analysis attacks and see how they

285
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
can integrate them into their tools

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
okay

287
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
good

288
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
um thank you very much about so the next

289
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,399
question that came in uh came from june

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,519
cheng

291
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
uh how will blockchain and hardware

292
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
security intersect

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
i think that's a

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
difficult one because it's very

295
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,079
difficult to predict what's going to

296
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,959
happen

297
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,640
i guess at the

298
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
blockchain side itself of course the

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
idea there is everybody can verify

300
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
things and so you can actually because

301
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,519
everybody can verify that we can all do

302
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
it on untrusted machines

303
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
because we all check each other

304
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
and i guess that's one part of the story

305
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,839
so in some sense what blockchain tries

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,120
to do is try to avoid or reduce our

307
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,959
reliance on highly trusted servers where

308
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
there is a fuses that means you control

309
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
everything or one player who controls

310
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
everything

311
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
on the other hand of course

312
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
and definitely if you move to the area

313
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
of cryptocurrencies but all important

314
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
transactions on the blockchain

315
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
and they're all driven by public key

316
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
cryptography which means that there is a

317
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
private key to sign something and a

318
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
public key to verify it

319
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
and of course we still have to properly

320
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
protect the private keys i think this is

321
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
something definitely where the need for

322
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,839
better key management

323
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,480
is um

324
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
coming forward and of course one of part

325
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,200
of the

326
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
of this story is is having secure

327
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
hardware story but also easy to use

328
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
secure hardware storage because of

329
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
course

330
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
um we have our bank cards which are easy

331
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
to use but if you ask people to manage

332
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
keys for a ca once you ever had to do

333
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
this you will find out something very

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
tricky and complicated

335
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
and so how can you make it very easy and

336
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,640
convenient to manage those keys to

337
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
control assets on a blockchain

338
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
while still having strong hardware

339
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,480
protection

340
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
and i think that's definitely an

341
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,519
interesting

342
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
point where there will be more need for

343
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,880
clever ideas in terms of hardware

344
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
yeah that's a good point and

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
if i may add something uh

346
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
i think there all these stories of of

347
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
people that um

348
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,000
had very secure hardware tokens

349
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
for their blockchain key and they forgot

350
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,639
the password right and then they have a

351
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,760
usb

352
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,040
encrypted usb token lying around and

353
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
it's worth whatever three million us

354
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
dollars right

355
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
so that might be another challenge you

356
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
know how do you do secure hardware

357
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
storage that is also somehow

358
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,079
allows recovery

359
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,320
you know for those passwords

360
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,279
yeah okay so the next question in chrono

361
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
chronological order came from

362
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
kevin what do you think about iscr

363
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
starting a new journal

364
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,000
well there have been some proposals

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
circulating

366
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
to do this

367
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
i think definitely our obligation

368
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
venues are not support not necessarily i

369
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
think if you would start from scratch

370
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
you would probably do things differently

371
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
they have

372
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
evolved over time

373
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
um i do think that in in the

374
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
hardware community i i do think there is

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,079
a

376
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,360
good mechanism i mean you saw the

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,519
statistics yesterday on peaches i think

378
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
in the end about half the papers get

379
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
accepted sometimes after many iterations

380
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,040
i think that's a very good number it

381
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,639
shows that

382
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,720
in fact you will not create by rejecting

383
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
eighty percent of papers this kind of

384
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
next layer of conference and in the next

385
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
area of conference and infinite layer of

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
confidence where results are being

387
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
resubmitted and reviewed

388
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,600
so i do think that with dgs we have

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
achieved a very nice model

390
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
it's also the same model used by by fse

391
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,959
but i think in general the community

392
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
probably needs um

393
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
good publication venues that are

394
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
actually guarantee quality and that also

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
deliver gold or platinum or whatever you

396
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
want open access i think

397
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
we have the tools and the means to to do

398
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,160
this ourselves and we should avoid

399
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
what's otherwise going to happen so if a

400
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
field is growing

401
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
and as icr we don't react

402
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,240
what happens is other will jump in and

403
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,560
they will come with more restricted most

404
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
publication and more scattering of the

405
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
fields

406
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,880
yeah and it's not that we have to have a

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,680
monopoly as icr but i think as a large

408
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
important player with actually

409
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
the experts on board i think we should

410
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,160
actually make sure that we have the

411
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,639
venues that can publish the output from

412
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,920
the community

413
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,519
we should avoid that people have to go

414
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,600
to many other venues where there is

415
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
probably

416
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
more annoying

417
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
access policies uh so where the editors

418
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,240
the publishers have more power over the

419
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,639
authors and we have the scattering where

420
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
maybe it becomes very hard to get access

421
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
to to results

422
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
so i think it's important that the

423
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,959
venues we have keep up i don't think the

424
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
problem is very pressing in the area of

425
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
chess but still i think it's something

426
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
that should be considered but of course

427
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,920
it's not something for me to decide

428
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
something for the community to decide

429
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
whether they want this or not um good

430
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
point yeah

431
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,760
yeah

432
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
kevin just to finish that up also says

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,680
as an example so there is um

434
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
the the ir iscr community has mostly

435
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,600
ignored traffic analysis so i don't know

436
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,839
whether that's something where we

437
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
want to look at a journal that might be

438
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,279
an option here

439
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,320
so the next question came from ian

440
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
you already contributed to many

441
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
publications in the cryptography area

442
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
what is your favorite topic in

443
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
cryptography

444
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and what is the underrated topic very

445
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
good question and the community should

446
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
investigate more in your opinion

447
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
i think it's a difficult question

448
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
because i tend to switch topics so i do

449
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,770
new topics all the time so it's kind of

450
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,680
[Music]

451
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
i guess my favorite topic is the one i'm

452
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
currently working on

453
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,880
so but of course i started my phds on

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
typographic hash functions and i still

455
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
think that there is many problems we now

456
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
have better designs but i still think

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
it's a kind of understudied field

458
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
there is a lot of progressive analysis

459
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
but i still like to work on this once in

460
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,519
a while

461
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
um

462
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
i think it's for the what i i think for

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the future i want to work even more on

464
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
is looking at how we can

465
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,079
reconcile technology development with

466
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
privacy and how to do this in practice

467
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
right of course there is a lot of

468
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
very nice critical developments and

469
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
probably i would not work on that there

470
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
is other smarter people of me doing that

471
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
but then we can deliver contribution how

472
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
to roll this out in practice so i was

473
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
very happy to to work in in the past one

474
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
and a half year with carmela who gave a

475
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
talk earlier this week

476
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
on rolling out this proximity detection

477
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,639
app

478
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,240
and so this is i think a very good

479
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
example in spite of the imperfections of

480
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
this app actually it's something that is

481
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
privacy preserving it's a large scale

482
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
infrastructure we got

483
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
about 100 million users in a very short

484
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
time

485
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
and it's privacy preserving which means

486
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
that when this pandemic is behind us

487
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
hopefully in half a year or a year we

488
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,079
can actually shut this down and there

489
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
will be no databases left with all our

490
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
interactions which i think is

491
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,759
something we should ideally also achieve

492
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,759
in in other areas where we can actually

493
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
get benefit from interaction but not

494
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
have this fact that we have this digital

495
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
trail where everything we do has been

496
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
collected

497
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
and analyzed and i think

498
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
this contact racing shows it's in

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
principle possible in spite of all the

500
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
shortcomings it had it's imprisonment

501
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,600
possible to do this

502
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
and i think you should encourage us we

503
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,000
try to do this for more applications

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,319
excellent point yeah thank you very much

505
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,599
bart

506
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,199
let's go to the next question by

507
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
muhammad

508
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
any thoughts in the future of privacy

509
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
preserving technologies eg

510
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
how do you view homomorphic encryption

511
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
versus confidential computing using

512
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
drastic execution environments very

513
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,599
broad

514
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,880
question which is a good fit for chess

515
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
yes i think definitely there is also

516
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
interest for chess in this so there is a

517
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,200
whole range of technologies where people

518
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
try to improve security and privacy and

519
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
so the confidence computing

520
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,679
says i build a secure processor

521
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,000
and please trust me

522
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
and

523
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,520
then we can run things in private on

524
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,960
there i think that's one approach and

525
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,840
then of course we have the more

526
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
cryptographic side

527
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,120
which is

528
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
fhe but also multi-party computation

529
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,720
that seems to be a bit more efficient at

530
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
this moment where you say trusted

531
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
cryptographers

532
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,559
and not the software or the hardware

533
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,600
so

534
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
and so you actually try to build trust

535
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
by having multiple independent systems

536
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
i guess of course in practice it's not

537
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
so easy to have multiple independent

538
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
systems because at this moment there is

539
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
three major cloud providers and

540
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,480
you can assume they will not collaborate

541
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
but maybe if some three-letter agencies

542
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
suggest to collaborate then they will

543
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,120
collaborate or maybe they're forced to

544
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
loot it i think there is a challenge

545
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
there as well

546
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
but i think it's definitely an important

547
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,880
area where we can make a difference

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
in society to kind of stop this massive

549
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
value situation which was created in the

550
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
last i would say two decades with

551
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
technology

552
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
and we can

553
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
try to get these technologies

554
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
into use of course

555
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
at this moment computational computing

556
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,559
in some sense

557
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
wins because it's much more efficient

558
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,520
but you have a much higher trust

559
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
relationship on the provider of the

560
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
hardware and

561
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
the person that runs the hardware

562
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
because how do you know the hardware is

563
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
there well there is attestation but if

564
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
this is corrupt well then you don't know

565
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
so the cryptographic

566
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
approach is preferable but of course

567
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,960
that's

568
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,440
is like a million times slower or was a

569
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
million times slower

570
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,400
than what we could do in clear text and

571
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,440
so now

572
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
we have already improved several odds of

573
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
magnitude but the question is how far

574
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
can we push this and i do think that

575
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,559
hardware can play a role there

576
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,360
i just want to add one caveat there and

577
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
i think this is something that

578
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
cryptographers and other researchers

579
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
tend to do we tend to oversell

580
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
so it's not because you do a computation

581
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,280
in private but actually it's legitimate

582
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
or ethical

583
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
to do it

584
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
so it can you can still run very

585
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,720
discriminatory very unfair and very

586
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
things which are bad for society but all

587
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
in encrypted domain it's not because

588
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,360
something is in the domain that actually

589
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,039
suddenly becomes a good computation to

590
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
carry out i think we should as

591
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
researchers be careful for this because

592
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
we selling our private technologies as

593
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,240
you know

594
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
improving humanity or

595
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
a gift to a memory because we give them

596
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
privacy and correct computations but in

597
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
fact these computations may be unethical

598
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
to do so this is something we should be

599
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
aware of that we don't oversell this as

600
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
a solution for all cures of humanity

601
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
because it could be a very damaging in

602
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,799
the long run as well

603
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,360
did you alluding to

604
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
cryptocurrencies and how they used for

605
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
ransomware or

606
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
not really i mean it's it's in general i

607
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
mean there is quite some some debates

608
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,799
for example at the highest level in eu

609
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
on ethics of ai

610
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,080
so and of course okay you have lots of

611
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,159
data you can do computations with these

612
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,919
computations depending on the bias in

613
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,600
your data depending on what you try to

614
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,679
compute can be creating discrimination

615
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,600
or bias or can be

616
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
very unfair

617
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
and so

618
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,480
if you read research papers introduction

619
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
people try to sell that this is all

620
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
private so it's all fine and i think we

621
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
should be aware that it's not because

622
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,360
something is private

623
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
but actually the computation itself the

624
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
goal of what is being computed

625
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
or the data that's taken and the

626
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
decisions that come out it's not because

627
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,520
they're done in private that they

628
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
actually are ethical for society

629
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,039
yeah

630
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
can actually be you could argue quite

631
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
the opposite right because you can do

632
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
bad stuff in in private right well we

633
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
can add transparency at least if you

634
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
know what's being done yeah which

635
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
computations but that still doesn't

636
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
justify doing certain computations

637
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
excellent now we'll be getting in into

638
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
big discussions which is good so the

639
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,840
next question comes from johannes mono

640
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
uh would you like to see more basic

641
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,200
specific research in the crypto

642
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
community

643
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
well i mean i've never done this myself

644
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
but of course my colleague ingrid has

645
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,720
been doing quite some of this work

646
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
my understanding is it's actually not so

647
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
easy to do in academic environment we

648
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
need quite some budgets to do this

649
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,240
because

650
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,520
i assume that if you want to do ac

651
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
specific research you don't not only

652
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
want to make designs on your computer

653
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,559
but also build them and this is of

654
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,520
course

655
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,799
time-consuming and challenging

656
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,679
especially in the framework of a phd

657
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,840
because there is some delays involved in

658
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
the processing

659
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
but i think yes it's definitely

660
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
something where academic world can make

661
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
a difference by really building things

662
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,720
and testing them at the asic level

663
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,440
um and i guess there is some projects

664
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
that allow you to do this to kind of

665
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
have multiple chips on one wafer and

666
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,400
then for a reasonable cost you can do

667
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
basic experiments but i think it's

668
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
definitely something

669
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,200
um

670
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,559
where i would say it's a world where we

671
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
still have a lot of security security

672
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,679
obscurity

673
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
and not transparency i think we would

674
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,559
benefit there from seeing what is

675
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
possible in terms of attacks and

676
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,440
defenses on those systems but definitely

677
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
there is a barrier of entrance there for

678
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
academic researchers

679
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,919
um yep yep good point

680
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
thank you so the next question um comes

681
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
from tom moss

682
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
what can we do to keep politicians from

683
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,200
demonizing secure crypto considering all

684
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,840
this quotation mark our intelligence

685
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,640
agency need to stay able to so to survey

686
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
criminals or if you don't have anything

687
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,919
to hide why encrypt your communication

688
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,320
kind of nonsense

689
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,919
yes this is kind of a debate i mean i

690
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,280
only have seven minutes left i could

691
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
give a one-hour talk about this

692
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,080
i think the main message is that this is

693
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,760
not a new debate it keeps coming back i

694
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
mean i remember i was involved as his

695
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
first in time the clipper chip in 93 so

696
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
this is when this debate started when

697
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
crypto became um cheap enough so it

698
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,280
could be in the hands of noble citizens

699
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
insecure crypto at least i think this

700
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,440
debate is going to come back and i think

701
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
as researchers we should

702
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,440
um keep repeating the message that of

703
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
course society will be better off with

704
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
protection

705
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,000
we also have

706
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
curtains and we have locks on our doors

707
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
but at some moment of course these

708
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
debates are very difficult and delicate

709
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,279
because of course the

710
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,919
those who want to limit or control

711
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,440
cryptography they will always come with

712
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,799
the horseman of the apocalypse child

713
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,440
pornography kidnapping terrorism so i

714
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
think society has to find

715
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
a balance in there

716
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
but we have not been able anything to

717
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,279
make systems that are magically secure

718
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,880
for everybody except for intelligent

719
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
services only on the days they really

720
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,080
need it

721
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
and i think it's important that

722
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,559
academics engage in this debate because

723
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,400
it's important that we keep sending this

724
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,159
message as a community that

725
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,000
it's more important to secure things and

726
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
of course we have to also look at the

727
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
problems

728
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
my main complaint is that the other side

729
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
is not engaging enough i see in the u.s

730
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,200
at least there is some of these people

731
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
who are engaged in debates in europe

732
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
it's even impossible to make them to

733
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
come to a debate

734
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,240
or if the meeting is scheduled at the eu

735
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,000
level it's council before it can even

736
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
happen you can't even discuss this topic

737
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
which i think is really bad for society

738
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,600
that's that's that's an interesting

739
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
observation yeah thank you

740
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,120
so um

741
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
i uh repeating the the second question

742
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,120
for from kevin and i'm sorry i wasn't

743
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,760
more clear about that earlier

744
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
why has the ircr community mostly

745
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,439
ignored traffic analysis

746
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
well i think it's just a different level

747
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
of abstraction

748
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
and i think this is being dealt with i

749
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
mean there is a pets community and have

750
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
no purpose they also have a hybrid

751
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,559
journal and i've also been active there

752
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,919
i think it's just a different level of

753
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
abstraction and there's different tools

754
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,679
different defenses um there is of course

755
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
a lot of study in pets of tour there is

756
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
now a new interest in

757
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,039
mixed networks

758
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,120
um so i think it's it's just it uses

759
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
slightly different tools and methods and

760
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
it just ended up in a different

761
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
community

762
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,159
but of course we understand it is as

763
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,080
important

764
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
to actually reduce

765
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,600
intelligence or to actually protect

766
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
yourself to deal with this

767
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,919
and i really hope that in the future

768
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
we'll see tools like single being

769
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,000
equipped or linked to a secure mix

770
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
network i think that would be really

771
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,799
interesting

772
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,240
there were a few people already looking

773
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
at the crypto of those things because i

774
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,039
think that's that i agree with that this

775
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,279
was under research i think at the last

776
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,960
europe there was a paper looking at this

777
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
at um

778
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
like what cryptographic needs are there

779
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
for something as a mixed network it's

780
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
slightly different from what we have for

781
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
say a single encryption or a messaging

782
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,039
encryption

783
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
excellent thank you

784
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
so next question is from lauren

785
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
as someone who traveled all to almost

786
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,480
every conference before call with what

787
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,799
is according to you the ideal conference

788
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,159
format

789
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,840
of the future post call with

790
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,640
i still think we will want to meet in

791
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
person for sure

792
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
so

793
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,400
um

794
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
i think icr has done a great job and i

795
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
think kudos to kevin and kay who are

796
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
instrumental in this in making the

797
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
online experience as

798
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
good as possible but we still miss the

799
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
coffee breaks the informal talks with

800
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,039
people um so i think this is something

801
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,039
we tried to replace and

802
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,320
there have been quite some efforts also

803
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,080
at icr level to have these chat rooms

804
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,720
and so on but it's just not the same

805
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,039
but i think if you look at the climate

806
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,960
challenge i think really icr should

807
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
rethink having all these small events

808
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
and we should probably decide to have

809
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
one event per continent per year and all

810
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,240
travel there and meet maybe a long event

811
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,159
where there can be overlapping parallel

812
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,880
events workshops and so on so like

813
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,159
i think that would

814
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
i think for me be perfect to have

815
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
something like this so that you can

816
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,640
actually go to one event and catch up uh

817
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,039
for many topics but also with with many

818
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
people

819
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,640
that's a good point yeah we should

820
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
definitely revisit that i think as a

821
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,679
community

822
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,200
um

823
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,960
so tim guiness

824
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,200
is asking fse and chess adopted the

825
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,960
hybrid journal conference model for

826
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,399
quite a while

827
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
do you think that the flagship

828
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
conferences crypto eurocrypt and asia

829
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
crypt should also move into this

830
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
direction

831
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,840
i think my personal viewers they should

832
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
because personally i like the reviewing

833
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
much better i find the reviewing

834
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
which i've been doing for

835
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,320
pets and for chess and for for um

836
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
that's actually more constructive so

837
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
actually i'm not like finding

838
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,320
reasons why i should reject this paper

839
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
so there is room for some other papers

840
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,080
but you actually try to see how you can

841
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,600
improve the paper so actually it will

842
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,799
make it

843
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,320
into

844
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,919
the program or in the publication i

845
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,760
think it's a much more positive attitude

846
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,039
and actually like this better it avoids

847
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,559
also that people are being reviewed and

848
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,919
reviewed again

849
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,520
uh with or without improvement and i

850
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
guess the last one

851
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
is even worse

852
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
um this is also the case that i mean we

853
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
didn't invent this mobile it came from

854
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,520
vldb and also many of the security

855
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
conferences the big conferences have

856
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,000
moved to this model so oakland

857
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
has moved to it and i believe also ndss

858
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
of course the problem we particularly

859
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,600
face with crypto agency and europe is

860
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,760
that it's kind of difficult to have each

861
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,039
of them have four deadlines we didn't

862
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,320
have per year because then we end up

863
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
with a deadline every two weeks

864
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,640
so i think there were some proposals

865
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
initially to do this but we didn't have

866
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
a good solution to this problem that

867
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
what are you going to do with eurocrypt

868
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
azure

869
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,880
crypto um but i think in the next years

870
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
we will have to risk this question maybe

871
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,799
because we want to reduce travel

872
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,720
but also because people like this model

873
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
on the other hand if there is a vocal

874
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
part of comedian wants to keep things as

875
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,279
they are

876
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,080
which i think was the case um

877
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,399
a while ago i think there is nothing

878
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,399
wrong with keeping it i think it's a

879
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,600
decision the community should take

880
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,039
whatever you want this

881
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
but i think it's particularly complex

882
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,720
because we have these three events which

883
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
are more or less equal but kind of hard

884
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,279
up to divide them up in other three

885
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
pieces there is too many pieces in the

886
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,000
puzzle

887
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
but there might be a solution but i

888
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
think the community has to decide what

889
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,799
they want there yeah

890
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,200
good point so i think there are

891
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,159
two final questions which are of course

892
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,480
very serious question from bohum people

893
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,360
so

894
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
first peter schwaben

895
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
um

896
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
when will the concert of your big band

897
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,399
feature in a crypto conference again

898
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,919
well if it's close enough to uh

899
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,760
belgium i'll take my event

900
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,840
last tour we went to latvia so i'm very

901
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,399
happy to to bring my van over if it's

902
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,399
within the driving range i mean flying

903
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,039
with event is a bit of a challenge

904
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
it's very expensive to get the bigger

905
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
instruments uh

906
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,919
but even if it's in a drivable distance

907
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
i'm happy to show up with my band for

908
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,399
sure

909
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,480
okay the chest you're in committee you

910
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
can also provide no takes notes yeah

911
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,240
okay

912
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,120
and then ami moradi is asking how often

913
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
do you read the book proceedings behind

914
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
you

915
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
they're more there to dampen the sound

916
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,480
in the room

917
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
maybe hard for for

918
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,640
people to understand but like 30 years

919
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
ago getting access to these books was

920
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,559
difficult getting access to information

921
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,120
was difficult i think until about 25 20

922
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,320
years ago

923
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,399
when we had e-print so these things were

924
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,240
very valuable i guess now you could just

925
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
check them out but it turns out that if

926
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,520
you do this with some of my colleagues

927
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
did then these rooms these university

928
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,279
rooms sound terrible they have an echo

929
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,200
of very large echo so these books are

930
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
very good for insulation and dampening

931
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
yeah yeah yeah

932
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,279
okay i think this is punchlanding as

933
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
they say you know we ran one minute over

934
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,840
which is pretty good um

935
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,200
oh there's a quick follow-up from

936
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,880
muhammad you see any sense uh uh for

937
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,799
instance the use case in trusting

938
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,440
hardware without attestation because

939
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,679
confidential computer consortium does

940
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
not include

941
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,039
it in the essential properties

942
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
well it solved depends on who you want

943
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
to trust i mean if

944
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,080
you're talking to a computer somewhere

945
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
and this computer says i'm secure and

946
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
nobody even attests any properties about

947
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,159
this computer but you just believe it

948
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,080
but if you're of the trust

949
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
if you're very a bit naive or you're

950
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
willing to trust

951
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,480
or you have other mechanisms maybe you

952
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
have all this or so to check this i

953
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,000
think it can be fine

954
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,440
in general i would be a skeptic and i

955
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,799
would like to see as much evidence as

956
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,080
possible that i'm really talking to a

957
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,679
secure computer

958
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,360
but i think we have to acknowledge that

959
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,440
there can be non-cryptographic or

960
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,039
non-technical means to check that this

961
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,720
is really this computer and that this

962
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
computer really has this processor

963
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
no i can understand it's not always

964
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,159
necessary

965
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,840
but of course then you need other

966
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
mechanisms and i think you have to be

967
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
very careful about how these mechanisms

968
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,080
can be corrupted

969
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,039
yeah

970
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,159
good point

971
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,679
okay so i think that concludes the uh

972
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,679
session thanks so much everybody in

973
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
particular but of course this was very

974
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
enlightening i learned a lot in the last

975
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,760
32 minutes yeah gives a big applause too

976
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,799
but

977
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,840
um

978
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
yeah thanks a ton to kay and kevin of

979
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,399
course you know for for coaching me and

980
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
helping me out and it was it was a great

981
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
experience and i liked the formula a lot

982
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,960
just um

983
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,720
ask me anything

984
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
so

985
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,640
with these words i think there's half an

986
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,799
hour break and then the next session
