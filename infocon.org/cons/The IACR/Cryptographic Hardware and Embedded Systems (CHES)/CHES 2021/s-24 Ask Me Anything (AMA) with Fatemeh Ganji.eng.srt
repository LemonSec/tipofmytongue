1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,760
i think that's nice

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,240
okay

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,840
and you're ready to go and i'll

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
spotlight

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,079
okay so uh welcome everybody to this uh

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,960
ask me anything session with uh or saba

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,920
ganji

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
um so the idea is uh that of course

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,680
you all in the audience can ask

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
questions to her

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,359
ideally you do this either through the

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,479
zoom chat or through the zulip chat

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,600
and then i will

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
relay the questions to her

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,079
so

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
let me first give a brief introduction

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
about saba so she did her phd from 2014

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
to 2017 at the university of berlin

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
um on the learnability of physical and

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
clonable functions

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
after that she moved to the us

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,559
initially to florida where she did a

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,879
two or three year postdoc

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,800
again looking at physically unclonable

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
functions so i suppose it's fair to say

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
that that's one of the things that she's

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,240
really known

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,040
for in the community especially i guess

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
breaking them

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
and then in 2020 uh she became an

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
assistant professor at the worcester

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
polytechnic institute

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,400
in massachusetts so still in the u.s

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,960
[Music]

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,159
so

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,920
because of course this is still early in

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
the discussion uh there are no questions

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
yet which

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
does not entirely surprise me uh but i

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
do have a question so saba you're

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
fairly recently uh i would say

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
made the the um transition from being a

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,360
postdoc uh to having an assistant

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
professor position

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,079
um

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
and uh how did you experience the change

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
was it a big change or was it like yeah

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
yeah that's a good question first of all

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
thank you for the invitation and for

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
having me it is great

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
to see

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
all of you of course i cannot see

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
everyone but

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,840
it's

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,598
amazing um

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,360
i would say so

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,319
also expand on some other topics uh try

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
to find other um

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,319
fields in the hardware security where

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,959
machine learning and um

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,720
of course more theoretical ones

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
from theoretical frameworks can be

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
applicable

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
and then as you said i

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
uh

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
began a new journey and

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
i would say

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
i was prepared because of the education

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
in germany was so good and we could

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
become

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,959
very independent even during our phd

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,760
studies that is one of the

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
differences that i can see

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,599
here in the usa and in germany

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,920
um

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
in germany we had the chance to

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
teach classes of course here tas can do

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
so sometimes um the course was

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
officially announced under the name of

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
the professor but

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
we could do most of the job for example

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
if there was a seminar to

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
um

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
hold or

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
if we had some labs we could do it all

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
by ourselves

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
we had the opportunity

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
to um

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,879
somehow

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
uh

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
familiarize ourselves

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,959
with what can happen

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,760
uh

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,040
in academia different problems different

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
um

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
situations for example one

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
that they can remember is that

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
we had a deadline to submit a proposal

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,400
it was

100
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
not ready

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
and we were trying our best to prepare

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
something and submit

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
and

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
that kind of

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
experiences

106
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
are now helping me a lot and then

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
of course in florida i had the chance to

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,040
see what is happening in the usa to

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
compare the systems to see what was the

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
difference between submitting a proposal

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,919
to bnbf

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,560

[Music]

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
main

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
i could not say man but one of the

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
institute that one can submit a proposal

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,440
in germany to get funding

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
and um the difference between that

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
institute and

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
nsf for example

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
when i was in germany i was thinking

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
about

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
getting funding from nsf and

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,479
in my mind that was the only

125
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
possible

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
institute but then

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
i had the chance to be founded by

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
me by the niece institute and then

129
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,479
i could see that no there are other

130
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,720
bodies that we can

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,340
rely on

132
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,639
[Music]

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
those differences could become clear to

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
me during my post art but to be prepared

135
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,150
to

136
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,520
[Music]

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
be in a position of

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
an assistant professor

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
um

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
i would say

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
um

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
main job was done in germany so in uh

143
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
during my phd studies i got prepared

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
some to some extent

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,479
so so you mentioned that um so you have

146
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
more independence you you reckon in

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
germany then you'd have as a phd student

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
in in the us

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
i would say so yeah

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
but as as uh

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,919
spider-man's uncle would say with great

152
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,800
independence comes great responsibility

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
um

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,039
so

155
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
how you deal with the responsibility of

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,680
this independence and how hard is it is

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
it as a phd student to already try to to

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
set what research areas you want to

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
investigate

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
that is a big deal

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
that was

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
let me tell you the story before uh

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
joining the group of

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
attilin when i got my a phd

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
from i was in another group

166
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
in that group we were even more

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
independent

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
and i had

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,479
the i was really lucky i would like to

170
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
have a specific topic

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
because i was involved in one of those

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,039
european found um

173
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
the phony was coming from

174
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,639
one of those programs supported by

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
european union but then and that program

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
is now over

177
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
um just before this mercury uh

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,800
foundation and the program there was

179
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
another program and the project was

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,759
supported

181
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
by that

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,400
and

183
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,360
so my project was defined i knew my

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
topic

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
but there were students who

186
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,800
had to find their best

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
topic to work on

188
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,919
sorry

189
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,919
niche topic to work on

190
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,520
and

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,639
it was not easy for them i could see how

192
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,840
difficult it could be

193
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,479
um and i can also add that

194
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
in germany

195
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,879
and

196
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,680
one can just do the research here the

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
students

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,759
have to take some courses it can be

199
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,039
somehow difficult for them to balance

200
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,879
between

201
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
learning something new and doing

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
something new in terms of research so

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
those

204
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
are the main differences

205
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
when it comes to

206
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,240
uh the life of a phd student

207
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
so so

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
now you mentioned it so so muhammad asks

209
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
how do you balance or manage time

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,599
between teaching research and proposal

211
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,960
writing

212
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
and what is your recommendation to young

213
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
researchers dealing with all of these

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
activities

215
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
um the best

216
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,478
advice

217
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,440
what to say

218
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
i'm experiencing the same

219
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,839
pressure

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
it is not easy

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
to

222
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
make a balance between all these three

223
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,760
because we have teaching we have

224
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
our own research

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,399
i would say writing a proposal is also

226
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
part of the research and we have

227
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
the

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
service

229
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
to serve the community to serve your

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
university

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
and of course we have a bigger community

232
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,040
for summer chess community and hardware

233
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
security community in my case

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,560
um it is hard to balance and

235
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
getting more experiences could be

236
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
helpful but what i can suggest is that

237
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
one should work with a mentor

238
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
i have great mentors here i have

239
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
external mentor

240
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
and he was my former supervisor

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
and i have also some internal mentors

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,600
um

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,760
it is good to have regular meeting

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
because they would say

245
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
um what you are going

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,320
to do is good but you can try these and

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,279
that

248
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,440
no one can um just give you a single

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
recipe to solve this issue

250
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
but when you talk to other people with

251
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,920
the same

252
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
experience in the same environment

253
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
atmosphere they could uh

254
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
see your problems

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
and they could relate it to their own

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,040
experience and give you some advices

257
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,959
but in general

258
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,760
it is not that easy at all

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
states it is taking time my mentor

260
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
told me

261
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,600
take your time take it easy and you are

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
learning that but in a very difficult

263
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
way

264
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
and this is the way that all the

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
professors

266
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,530
could

267
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,630
[Music]

268
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,640
experience

269
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
yeah so since you uh mentioned mentor uh

270
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
i would like to just point out to people

271
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
who are watching that uh at crypto this

272
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,120
year

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,480
uh there was actually an affiliated

274
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
workshop on mentoring

275
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
and of course the the videos are online

276
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,399
so uh allow me to make this a brief plug

277
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
uh to another icr event um

278
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,279
so

279
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,640
um

280
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,200
elk asks uh whether it was a conscious

281
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
choice to stay in academia

282
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
yes that was my choice from the

283
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,839
beginning i knew that

284
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
i knew that i want to stay and i did my

285
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
best it was not easy at all

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
and

287
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
actually tonight still it is tonight for

288
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,839
us

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
and now it is uh

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,160
about half as far

291
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
in the east coast

292
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
and um

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,760
you may know i'm in a relationship my

294
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
husband is also a researcher we are in

295
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
the same field

296
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
we were working uh in the same labs

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
since 2012.

298
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
so now finding

299
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
uh

300
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
two jobs in this job market and in the

301
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
bigger

302
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
the job market last year the hearing

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
covet era

304
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
it was very hard

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
and we tried differently

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
and

307
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,580
i did my best to

308
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,000
[Music]

309
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
just

310
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,519
be ready to make sacrifices if needed

311
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
i remember that um

312
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
when i was a phd student i was in a

313
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,920
program

314
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,959
uh

315
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,120
and um

316
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
and at that program it was conducted by

317
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,279
uh

318
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
in germany

319
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,680
uh they were interested in our

320
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,880
experiences as female researchers

321
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,279
the questionnaire was the same but every

322
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,160
six

323
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
months we received

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,160
that questionnaire the same questions

325
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,600
and we had the chance to revise

326
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
the answers and if they could see that

327
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,079
we are making

328
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,560
some changes maybe that

329
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,639
was relevant to their studies

330
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,120
um one of the question

331
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
one of the questions was that are you

332
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
ready to make sacrifice

333
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,839
and

334
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,360
and when i was

335
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,160
a young patient i was always choosing

336
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
yes i'm ready i'm ready

337
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
but then

338
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
just

339
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
before getting graduated

340
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,399
i received the question and i wanted to

341
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,040
answer this question and i was thinking

342
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,720
am i really ready

343
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
to make any sacrifices i love to be in

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
academia

345
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,760
this is why i did phd now

346
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
if i have to give it up what should i do

347
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,959
i was very

348
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
lucky my husband

349
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,040
is also very lucky we could make it but

350
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,320
it is not always the case for the female

351
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
researchers that in major researches

352
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,240
both

353
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
sides

354
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
would sacrifice something

355
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,120
and

356
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,519
it is not easy

357
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,680
yeah so so what kind of sacrifices uh

358
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
are you were you kind of willing to make

359
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,880
or what were you thinking of that you

360
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,680
had to to make and um

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
also you mentioned your husband were you

362
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
then

363
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,079
both equally willing to make sacrifices

364
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
or was there then uh

365
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,160
he was not in a program but every time

366
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
that i received a question i asked him

367
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,600
and i told him you know i am choosing

368
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
this answer yes what is your answer he

369
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
was also very supportive he was also

370
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
saying yes

371
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,279
go for it

372
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,399
and

373
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
actually it happened to us

374
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,600
uh when he had to make sacrifices

375
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
because when we moved from florida to

376
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,079
wooster

377
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,600
to join

378
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
wpi

379
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
i was

380
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
hired as a tenure track

381
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,519
professor and they said that

382
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,800
now to resolve the two-body issue

383
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,959
um we may take time to prepare the same

384
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
package for showing my husband

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,680
and it took less than a year but

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,519
i would say he

387
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
needs sacrifice

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
and it is very important for me it is

389
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
very valuable

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
in my eye

391
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
by the way this two-body issue or

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,959
two-way

393
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
problem is

394
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
quite serious

395
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
um

396
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,639
what another difference that i can

397
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,600
mention

398
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,170
between uh being

399

[Music]

400
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
a researcher in academia in germany and

401
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,759
in the us is that here

402
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,560
i would say it is easier to handle this

403
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
they have

404
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
many different possibilities and

405
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
opportunities to resolve the issue

406
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
um

407
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,399
i couldn't um

408
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,440
research how it is handled in germany

409
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
but based on my own experiences

410
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,360
uh

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
i feel that here it is

412
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,880
handled

413
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
quite a smoothly

414
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,040
compared to germany of course

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,040
okay

416
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,079
so uh there's another question from elke

417
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,480
which relates the mentoring so

418
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
she was there

419
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,160
and

420
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,759
so she is wondering whether being a

421
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,000
woman has influenced your career and

422
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,240
your choices

423
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,400
i would say

424
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
maybe some various very specific and

425
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,640
very

426
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,480
very

427
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,868
uh

428

[Music]

429
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:27,919
you know

430
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
i would not say those decisions that i

431
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
made because i was a female researchers

432
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
will be

433
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,240
big decisions that i have made

434
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
but from time to time in our everyday

435
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,559
lives

436
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,760
it is

437
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
inevitable

438
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
i would say um because

439
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,960
um

440
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
i have to for example take care of

441
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
something as

442
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,039
um

443
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,520
a sister as a daughter

444
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
then i have to give up something but it

445
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
was not a big deal

446
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,039
and

447
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,039
my big decisions were not influenced

448
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,919
by the gender

449
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,720
but

450
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
as i said from time to time small

451
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
decisions

452
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
have been just impacted and

453
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
since yeah

454
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
so so um

455
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
do you think it affects the work life

456
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
balance

457
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,440
it's it can i am as if

458
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
i think all the female researchers and

459
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,760
of course male researchers when they are

460
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,480
in a relationship and it is a serious

461
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,760
relationship they have some

462
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
obligations some duties

463
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
then

464
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,559
making these palaces important for both

465
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
genders doesn't

466
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,360
make any difference all types

467
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,400
should make

468
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,280
this

469
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,530
balance

470
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,840
[Music]

471
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
i don't think that being a female

472
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,440
researcher

473
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,400
can

474
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
make any difference when it comes to

475
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,840
making this

476
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,039
balance um

477
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,919
even when it comes to our hobbies

478
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,679
maybe

479
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,000
something um

480
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,720
i like but i have to give up but i could

481
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,480
see that for example my husband is

482
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
giving up something

483
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
to make this balance

484
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
all in all

485
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,280
having this balance in life is very

486
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
important

487
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,520
but

488
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
it is

489
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,720
challenging

490
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
and i would say during kobe time

491
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
it got even worse

492
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,000
when you're at home there's a very

493
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,039
blurry

494
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,840
um

495
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,320
um uh

496
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,440
bound

497
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
between what you can do now as a

498
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
researcher and what you can do

499
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,799
has a wife as a husband

500
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,919
in any

501
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,360
capacity

502
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,039
it is

503
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
getting harder and

504
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,320
i'm really happy that the school is open

505
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,439
this year and we could

506
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,600
go to the classes and

507
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
um then i know that um

508
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,159
i go to the school i spend some hours i

509
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,919
i come back

510
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,200
and

511
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,240
i just

512
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
take care of something at home again i

513
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,280
have another

514
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
time slot to work on something that i

515
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
like

516
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,640
the research problems that i'm thinking

517
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
about or if i want to read a book or

518
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,679
prepare myself for the

519
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,200
next class

520
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
um

521
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
i think

522
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:50,960
the

523
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
it is getting better

524
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,480
but

525
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,240
the core issue was very serious

526
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
yeah i can imagine so let's briefly go

527
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
back to to your research um so mormont

528
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
is asking uh what is the main motivation

529
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
for you to to pick a particular topic uh

530
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
how do you choose a research area to

531
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
work in i mean i'm paraphrasing the

532
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,719
question a little bit but um

533
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
um

534
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,960
first of all one should feel comfortable

535
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,640
working on something for example if i

536
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,240
choose something very new

537
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
for a while i should first prepare

538
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,840
myself collect information read more

539
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,120
papers

540
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,400
and try to find

541
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
what is niche now but sometimes when you

542
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
spend enough time

543
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,520
working on one specific topic then you

544
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,799
know all those all the corners of that

545
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
now you know um

546
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,120
what you can do to improve this what are

547
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
the shortcomings of that but

548
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
um

549
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
it is important as a researcher to

550
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,880
switch from one topic to another one

551
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
and

552
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,520
from my point of view uh

553
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
at least

554
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,320
uh in the earlier stages of carrier it

555
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,760
is good to see

556
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
a diverse

557
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,799
range of topics and

558
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,440
try to find the relationship between

559
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
those try to observe what is happening

560
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,799
in that field that could be applied in

561
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
the other field

562
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,400
um but choice of topics really depends

563
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
on also your own background

564
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,080
if one does not have a strong background

565
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,480
in for example physics

566
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
it could be

567
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
harder for him or her

568
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,440
to

569
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
pick up another topic like let's say

570
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,080
physical attacks in practice

571
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,570
when one has to know the specific um

572
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,360
[Music]

573
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,400
characterization of the device

574
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
for example the beyblade of the laser

575
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
that you want to use it's something like

576
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,200
that

577
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,320
that's stigma

578
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
examples

579
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,880
that comes to my mind

580
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,679
um so background is important

581
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,290
knowing the

582
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,799
[Music]

583
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,400
community and

584
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
being involved in activities is very

585
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
important when

586
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
one

587
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
has a chance to attend conferences and

588
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,919
events like chess like crypto

589
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,320
um like um ccs then you could see what

590
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
people are working on

591
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
and then

592
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,919
if you're interested you can spend

593
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,240
some time thinking about it if you can

594
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
if you're that interested then you will

595
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
begin collecting

596
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,640
some more materials to read

597
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,559
to prepare yourself

598
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,879
and

599
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,480
i don't have any recipe for it

600
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
okay it is very kind of personal

601
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,120
so at the

602
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,840
ama of of tanya i think she also uh

603
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,000
mentioned that

604
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,799
she also looks a bit what uh of picking

605
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
areas that that she thinks are going to

606
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
grow

607
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
in a way so are you also looking at

608
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
these sort of external factors that you

609
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
try to make strategic choices or

610
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
is it more intrinsic what interests you

611
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
or

612
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,799
it should be a balance from my point of

613
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,559
view

614
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
i can give you

615
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
a very good example of someone who can

616
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,360
make a balance

617
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
and can find

618
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
a good

619
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,559
topic which might not be interesting

620
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,600
today

621
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,120
but it can grow

622
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,039
and also his

623
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,240
kind of let's say

624
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,799
side problems

625
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
to think about

626
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,000
as his own um

627
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
interesting topic and

628
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
that person

629
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
is my phd advisor professor jean-pierre

630
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
zeifer

631
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
he's very good at choosing the topics i

632
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
learned a lot from him

633
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
um

634
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,520
so there are some topics that you can

635
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,640
always

636
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
see that they are growing

637
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
for example

638
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
post quantum cryptography

639
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,279
it is growing and it is fascinating it

640
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
is good to

641
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
have some experience working on that

642
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,120
topic and so on but

643
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,279
he's a mathematician for example he's

644
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,600
interested in some other

645
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,640
problems

646
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,679
and

647
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
he can now spend some time to

648
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,240
just work on those problems

649
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,559
but i don't know at earlier stages of

650
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,520
the carrier is it possible to do so

651
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
it can be very hard because

652
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,039
um

653
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,640
as i said

654
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
and

655
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,279
based on what we discussed

656
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,880
related to the other uh problem

657
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,400
and the question uh making this

658
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,039
life carrier balance and then making the

659
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,480
balance between research teaching and

660
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,880
service

661
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
that can get harder

662
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
if you want to have

663
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,919
the main topic and some other

664
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,640
side topics here and there

665
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
but

666
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,400
as i said i prefer to have both

667
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,000
okay

668
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
um

669
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,880
so i think we're running out of time

670
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
and i think you also have a session to

671
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,840
chair uh yes i

672
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,000
do so uh

673
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
there are still some questions uh on the

674
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,159
zulub in fact there's one question from

675
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,720
mohammad that's a follow up

676
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
to the question i asked so maybe you can

677
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,679
go back

678
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,240
and respond to him on the zulip if after

679
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,279
your session chair yes i will do so

680
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
and then well i very much like to thank

681
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,360
you for

682
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,799
taking part in this ask me anything

683
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,720
it was very enlightening and i hope that

684
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,039
the audience also uh

685
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,240
uh had some benefit uh from it and

686
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,120
uh

687
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,039
yeah thank you very much

688
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,799
thank you for hosting me that was really

689
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,600
good talking to you and

690
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
i hope uh

691
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,039
what i have said could be beneficial to

692
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,240
some of the

693
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,679
um

694
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
peers and mainly younger researchers in

695
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
our community

696
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
thank you
