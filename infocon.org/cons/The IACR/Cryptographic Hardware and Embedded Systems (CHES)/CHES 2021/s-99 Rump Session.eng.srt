1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,880
um

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,199
and we're live on youtube so have a good

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,600
ramp session

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,279
thank you very much

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,680
thank you

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
so i think we can uh start it should be

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
the case that everyone sees me screen

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
write my slide setup should be working

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
well

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
so i'm diego again i'm honored to

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
co-chair the rum session with yuval

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
yagam i waited my whole career to be

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
able to do this

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,119
so

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
i hope you have some fun

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,920
before we start though with the with the

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,880
talks i want to do some uh introspection

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
right on

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
where our community might be heading

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
so let's start with some wisdom so i was

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
a wise cryptographer would probably say

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,760
that

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
the secret for a fulfilling research

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
life is writing a book on cryptography

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,520
maybe even raising academic children or

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,000
planting merkel treaties although these

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
the last ones might not help with the

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
environment

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,199
however this is not compatible with late

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
stage capitalism which governs most of

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
us in our daily relations where

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
happiness is is mandated by how many

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
awards and prices you get there is

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
pressure to you know be stronger faster

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
to get more money to get more awards so

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,439
i spent the the whole week thinking of

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
how to how to manage this and this is

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
particularly hard in denmark because

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
there is something called the intel law

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
um which says that everyone is equal so

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
given award is a bit of a taboo in

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,400
scandinavia in general because well

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,360
you're

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
making someone special by awarding them

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
with something

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
um and well i have to say that everyone

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
is equal it's something that really

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
the danish population

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
obeys um except for the immigrants

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
so but there is a solution to this we

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
can we can kind of make these two

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
requirements compatible we can just give

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,119
awards to everyone we give awards to

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,360
everyone and chess this edition of chess

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
has been great on this because there are

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
many awards half of this session will be

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
just giving awards and awards

58
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,719
and there will be awards for almost

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,680
everyone

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,079
but some of us will not get awards and i

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
think we need to do something about it

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
so we all have um happy lives so to give

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,878
everyone an award we need to create an

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
award for each of us we should pick each

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
of our members of this community and

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
create a special award for them so some

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
ideas i've had we could have an award

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
for the worst person attacking the nice

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
mailing list

70
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
we could do the award to the co-author

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
who contributed the least for a paper

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
or perhaps the most reviewed you

73
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
reviewer

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
for chess or any other acr conferences

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,959
um the best rsa cosplayer that really

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
deserves an award

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,720
and maybe the largest research group

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
stolen by a blockchain startup so we can

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
give award to lots of people although

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
they will be very rich already

81
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
but none of these are socially cone

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
shows so i thought of you know one award

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
that has some relationship with the

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
pandemic we're living through

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
and that's the

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
award to most related to cov19 research

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
which i call amoreco

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
this is a portuguese word for a small

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
law of acute word for love because i

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,200
think we all need some love during this

91
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
pandemic has been tough to

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
almost everyone

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,440
so without uh further ado i would like

94
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
to announce the winner of the amore echo

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
of the first america award the first

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
america prize and um perhaps

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
surprisingly this will not be awarded to

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,480
a contact tracing uh paper it will be

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
awarded to um side channel protection

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
for picnic signatures since baby i'm a

101
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
co-author that's that's a coincidence

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,239
it's not a conflict of interest in any

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,120
way

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
i i would like to thank my co-authors

105
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
for this wonderful collaboration and i

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,080
think i should justify why we deserve

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
this award uh basically because we are

108
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,560
fighting the pandemic by having a masked

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,519
picnic

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,840
um if you're not happy with this

111
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
decision you can also

112
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
be very welcome to chair your own room

113
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
session create your award and give it to

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
yourself

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
but maybe the most pragmatic way of

116
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
earning this award would be dedicating

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
research efforts to fighting the

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
pandemic so maybe doing a musket

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
barbecue or musket banquet all of this

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
would be worthy of the morocco award in

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
the next editions of isr conferences so

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
now a bit more seriously now for the run

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
rum session program we receive eight

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
submissions

125
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,759
uh in this spirit of giving awards to

126
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
everyone we have accepted more

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
submissions than we got uh we won't have

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
a social game during the rum session um

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
the only game we play it's kind of old

130
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
school is called democracy so it's

131
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
amazing it's you get to vote for

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
something you like and then the

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
the one who gets most votes uh will

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
actually receive a one word so we'll

135
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
have two categories that you can access

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
i'll paste the link on soon the first

137
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
one is the best award ceremony award and

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
the second one is the best rum session

139
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
talk award and the second one for the

140
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
best from session talk award you

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,440
actually get something which would be a

142
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
cheap whisper and one disclaimer i have

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
to say is we're not responsible if the

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
chip whisperer ends up killing you and

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
uh yuval thank you for the donation of

146
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,039
this cheaper whisper platform for us to

147
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,039
um to award someone

148
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
and by that by that effort you will get

149
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
the best room session talk price award

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
so congratulations you will

151
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
so the rum session program will be split

152
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
in three and let's say a half parts uh

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,800
the first part would be the serious

154
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
business right the chairs reports

155
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
announcements and and awards second part

156
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
will be the technical wrap-ups for the

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
chess challenges there were two running

158
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
for the past uh few weeks

159
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
more awards and more announcements and

160
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
the third part will be the traditional

161
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,919
mix of a series and amusing talks um

162
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
that you get to vote for which one wins

163
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
the uh the best talk award and we finish

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
with the banquet which i think will um

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,120
consist of us salivating uh for or

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,080
against videos of delicious food so now

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
i passed the control to uvo who will

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
conduct the first part of the rom

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
session thank you very much for your

170

over um so the um we're gonna report a

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
little bit about what the how we came up

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
with this program that you've now

194
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
already enjoyed for four days and are

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
going to enjoy for another day tomorrow

196
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,440
um can you maybe switch to the next

197
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,759
slide

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
yes i

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
i i can't i seem to have the same issue

200
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
as um yes that's right earlier okay so

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
as most of you know since 2018 chess is

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,560
um

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
the chess proceedings are run through a

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
hybrid model so we have the transactions

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,199
of chess teachers

206
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,960
um for the publications

207
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
which are published in platinum openx

208
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
journal

209
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
with four issues per volume and four

210
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
deadlines per year so every three months

211
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
there is a deadline where you can submit

212
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,319
papers

213
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
the journal is published by our

214
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
university bochum

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
who also makes it possible for us to

216
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,319
open this platinum open access

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,680
because they're actually donating quite

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
some resources i recently learned how

219
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
much effort it is for them and the

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,440
managing editor is tinganesu

221
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
the review process through these four

222
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
deadlines is carried out by the

223
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,160
editorial board which is also known as

224
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
the chess program committee so this just

225
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,759
completely coincide

226
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
and which is led by the editors-in-chief

227
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,000
and for the addition of chess that

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
you're right now enjoying that was elka

229
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,479
and me and right now that is thomas and

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
sonia for the chess edition next year

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
usually they're chosen

232
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
to have well one person from academia

233
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
and one from industry so in our case

234
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,879
that's elka being at rambus and me being

235
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,840
at mpisp

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
in this year's edition what we did is we

237
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,759
had well of course a review phase for

238
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
the papers we did have a rebuttal or

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,039
response phase

240
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,800
and then followed by a discussion phase

241
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
we the the possible outcomes were

242
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,719
well either paper gets accepted

243
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,799
or minor revision is requested which

244
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,159
means that it goes through a shepherding

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
process so you can think of it as a

246
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,279
conditional accept

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
then there is a request for a major

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
revision which means that it is not

249
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
accepted for the current deadline but

250
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
that there is a clear list of revision

251
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,760
requirements and if the authors

252
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
implement that and resubmit one of the

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,320
next two deadlines then it will be

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
evaluated again based on if these

255
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
changes have been implemented

256
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,760
or reject

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,279
possibly with an encouragement to

258
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,399
resubmit

259
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,800
which is typically given if a principle

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
the topic is very very interesting and

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
would like to see a revised version of

262
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
chess but it's not possible to come up

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
with a very clear list of revision

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
requirements

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,800
so

266
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,399
at this moment i will hand over to elka

267
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,200
so um yeah a little bit more about this

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
uh editorial board we chose we had 61

269
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,760
members in

270
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
um including peter and me

271
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
we

272
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,920
um 43 came from industry 57

273
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
was from academia

274
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,519
um

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
location wise

276
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
you can see the map over there um it's a

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
it's

278
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,399
very european centric 62 of all our

279
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
members came from europe

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
15 from the americas and

281
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,040
23 from the asia-pacific

282
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
side of the world

283
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
but we try to balance it a little bit

284
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
same thing with

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
gender we had eighty percent

286
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,680
male

287
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
20 female

288
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
not that that is balanced but

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,760
um

290
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,480
that's what it is and

291
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
we had 26

292
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
of our members who are new members so we

293
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
try to

294
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
rotate

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
um

296
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
after a couple of years

297
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,480
try to rotate people out and then

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
get some new people in the in the board

299
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,279
all right this is uh these are all the

300
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,160
names

301
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,079
so thank you to all these people who

302
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,200
contributed to the reviews

303
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
and sharing sessions and chat running

304
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
everything to that everything

305
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
we

306
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
typically we ask the reviewers to do

307
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
their own reviews but occasionally

308
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
reviewers will ask super viewers

309
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,399
to

310
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,120
help them out or we ask other people to

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
have an additional review

312
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,680
so there were 23 external reviewers this

313
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
year

314
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,000
we asked for an extra opinion so also

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
thanks to those people

316
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,839
peter back to you

317
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,120
yeah so

318
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
with all of this process we came up with

319
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
a program that well you hopefully all

320
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
enjoying now for already for quite a

321
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,079
while we had uh two keynote talks one

322
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
today and one on tuesday by robert

323
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,640
watson and camilla francosso

324
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
we have a total of 13

325
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,920
technical sessions or 13 sessions of

326
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
papers that are published in t-chests

327
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
was a total of 78 accepted papers so

328
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,959
that was a very nice division that we

329
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,440
got six papers per session

330
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
we had these short life talks of about

331
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
five minutes plus q a where the longer

332
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
talks are on youtube this format i think

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
has been now pretty much established for

334
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
virtual conferences of the icr and

335
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
running pretty successfully

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
we're having one ramp session huge

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440

338
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
um we had four i had well we had three

339
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
we'll have another one um ask me

340
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
anything sessions uh with uh with colin

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
with tanya with saba and with bart

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,600
tomorrow

343
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
and um there was one chess test of time

344
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
award presentation where

345
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
louis gubar agreed to

346
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
give a talk actually about this paper

347
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
that received the award which i think is

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
is really nice and uh

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
i think we all enjoyed looking back at

350
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,880
this

351
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
result that influenced quite a bit in

352
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,760
our field

353
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
okay

354
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,959
yeah so in total we had 256 uh 256.

355
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
don't know where it's 6000. there are

356
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,040
250 submissions to review

357
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,240
um

358
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,160
of which

359
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,320
192 were unique submissions so

360
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
we had um

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,079
some

362
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,639
revisions and resubmissions but

363
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
it all uh it also

364
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,720
250 submissions review um with our 628

365
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,000
unique authors and

366
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,480
241 accepted authors

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,839
you can see the division there so we

368
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
have 250 papers in total there were 62

369
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,079
long papers papers 16

370
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
resubmissions so people who asked for

371
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,040
permission to resubmit a previously

372
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
rejected paper

373
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,240
45 revised papers

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,880
there were 53 papers from the program

375
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
committee

376
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,240
and uh yeah and so 192 new papers

377
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
here are the acceptance rates

378
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,120
so overall we had an acceptance rate of

379
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
31

380
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
which is a little higher than

381
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,000
last year

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,279
if you look at the

383
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,760
papers accepted by

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
um authors who are in the program

385
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
committee that's a little higher 37

386
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
percent

387
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
long papers seem to get accepted a

388
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,519
little bit more i don't know whether

389
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
that's because people are

390
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,000
not reading them carefully or

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
or because people are

392
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
doing yeah i don't know better job at

393
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
the long papers so almost 50 of all the

394
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
long papers gets accepted

395
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
what's interesting though is that

396
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,440
revisions

397
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
um and resubmissions have a

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
higher acceptance rate than than the

399
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
general paper the revisions is almost 90

400
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,639
so as a deco message

401
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,600
um if you want to get a paper accepted

402
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
don't get it accepted and try again and

403
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,000
um

404
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
you get to 90 well try to aim for the

405
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
major revision

406
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
part

407
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
if you had uh submitted a new paper so

408
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,160
the first time you submit a paper

409
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,480
uh except the threat is only 17 or 18

410
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
so a lot of papers go through this cycle

411
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
where they go from

412
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
first mission to like

413
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
sort of revision then get accepted

414
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,639
and

415
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,399
the second type they get submitted so

416
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,959
when they are like a major revision

417
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
um they'll go through another minor

418
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
revision and then get accepted that

419
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
seems to be like the standard

420
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
part for most papers

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
peter do you want to say

422
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
take over here so

423
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,319
i can say something here so um

424
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
one interesting thing that you see on

425
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
this slide

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
is that well of course um no actually

427
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
you see that there is no

428
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,079
um green bar under major revision and

429
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,399
the reason for this is that teacher says

430
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
the rule that a paper can't go to major

431
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,279
revision twice

432
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
so um basically we

433
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
the spirit behind this is that we don't

434
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,600
want to see a paper over and over again

435
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
and giving it a second chance with a

436
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,759
clear request of revision requirements

437
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
makes a lot of sense it actually is a

438
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
very successful concept but you don't

439
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,920
want to want to iterate that forever

440
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
when you look at this it's maybe also

441
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
interesting to see that

442
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
um

443
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
papers that

444
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
were rejected actually

445
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
do go to a major revision so we had a

446
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,279
few papers that were resubmitted and

447
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,079
they went to a revision and

448
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,480
oh to a major revision and we had some

449
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
discussions about this and as far as i

450
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,759
recall the conclusion is that in this

451
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
year's um edition so next year's 2022

452
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
this rule will change so basically um

453
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
also if you resubmit a paper well it can

454
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
it will get a second chance but it won't

455
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
get a third chance so basically then we

456
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,120
have to make a decision does it go in

457
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
potentially through shareholding or not

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
i think that's the most important

459
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,040
take-home message from this very

460
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
involved graph here

461
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,399
maybe you can go for the next slide

462
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
um yeah some statistics

463
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
whatever

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
yep i mean this is the curve of the

465
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
amount of others per paper

466
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,760
three seems to be the most popular one

467
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,400
but we had papers with 11

468
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
others too

469
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,359
and some

470
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,520
who wrote their own

471
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
paper by themselves

472
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,160
so

473
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,840
there's that

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,600
this one is

475
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
sort of interesting

476
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
so this is a graph

477
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
where

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
on the x-axis the number of papers

479
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
submitted by accepted authors who did

480
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,960
multiple submissions so a lot of people

481
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
submits multiple papers because we have

482
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,039
four deadlines

483
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,200
and so people submit

484
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,640
multiple papers and then

485
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,760
uh

486
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
these are

487
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,400
all the

488
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
papers that got submitted and on the

489
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
y-axis the papers that got acceptance

490
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
of the papers that's me and

491
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
this graph is sort of interesting

492
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,400
because there is one big outlier

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
i think amin bharati he submitted

494
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,240
13 there were 30 submissions

495
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
i'm not sure that whether these three

496
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,679
were unique or whether they went through

497
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,919
major visions didn't check that but 10

498
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
of them got accepted

499
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,840
so that was pretty

500
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,320
impressive and then

501
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,720
because we wanted to find something

502
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
some fun statistic

503
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
so if you

504
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
submit the paper to chess and you get

505
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
accepted you should

506
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
submit another paper to chess because it

507
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
will with 100

508
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
probability you will get it accepted

509
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
don't don't submit more because then

510
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,919
your

511
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,240
acceptance rate will go down but just

512
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
two and you will be fine so take home

513
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
message here to get a paper accepted get

514
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
a paper accepted

515
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
you get both options to get a paper

516
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
accepted don't get it accepted and to

517
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,160
get a paper accepted get it accepted

518
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,120
and um

519
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
these are or

520
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
pigeons maybe you can take over again

521
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
yeah so interesting to see here is the

522
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
distribution of countries maybe it's not

523
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,120
so shocking if you know that

524
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,559
amir submitted 13 papers so i think all

525
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,440
while a large portion of the 81

526
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
um

527
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,039
authors from germany are actually from

528
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,320
amir's group

529
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
but then you see that well

530
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
somewhat like the program committee

531
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
which is somewhat europe-based um also

532
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
the following countries are belgium the

533
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
netherlands france united kingdom so at

534
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
least for some definition of europe this

535
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
is all europe-based and then it

536
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
continues with um with

537
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,559
asia with uh with china taiwan and korea

538
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,240
and only then comes the usa

539
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,679
all right

540
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,440
see

541
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,799
um yeah world club with all the

542
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,919
titles nothing very surprising hardware

543
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
masking fault attacks

544
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,880
analysis side channel

545
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,440
um seems like a traditional chess which

546
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,320
i guess is a good thing

547
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,039
and then we would like to thank um

548
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
some people

549
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,919
peter do you want to do the honors i can

550
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
i can do this well of course uh elko

551
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,440
already mentioned earlier when showing

552
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,120
all the names of our program committee i

553
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,080
think they did a really great job and um

554
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,919
doing this over a whole year and well

555
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
some of them were already in the in the

556
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
committee the year before and some of

557
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,080
them are continuing to be right now it

558
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,559
is this continuous flow incoming flow of

559
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,480
papers that one reviewing that you're

560
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
not supposed to give to sub reviewers

561
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
and um i think they did a really really

562
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,960
great job and it was was a very pleasant

563
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,039
experience to work with all of them

564
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,120
um of course we would also like to thank

565
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,799
our external reviewers maybe some of

566
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,159
them are here

567
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,880
um then of course the general shares

568
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
it's always a bit of a pity if you're

569
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
planning to

570
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,559
host a conference somewhere in a nice

571
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
place and welcome people there then you

572
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
have to go for a virtual setup but i

573
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
think it's still a very very important

574
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
job to do it in this virtual setting and

575
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080

we would like to be program chairs at

606

to run the rum session

611
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,520
same thing it's probably more fun to run

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
a round session when you're on a real

613
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
stage with the people right in front of

614
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
you but i'm hoping that you'll get

615
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
another chance it's a nice location

616
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480

630
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360

632
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
growing and uh and being very alive

633
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,600
despite the global epidemic

634
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,039
right and then we will go over to the

for everyone who attended all the talks

645
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
today i think it was one of the talks

646
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,039
that also i enjoyed most so it's not

647
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,559
just the best paper but it would also be

648
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,400
a candid for yet another award namely a

649
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
very very great at least presentation

650
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,039
today

651
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,480
um it's the paper

652
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,679

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,880
i'm brazilian it comes out naturally

679
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,180
sorry

680
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,240
[Laughter]

681
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
so um

682
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
yeah congratulations again and i think

683
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,679
with this we can conclude the

684
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,919
presentation by the program chairs and

685
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,000
head over to the next program point for

686
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,840
the wrong session

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
okay thank you very much for the

688
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
presentations and

689
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
you seem to have forgotten to

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,320
to thank the program chairs so uh

691
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,279
on behalf of the program chairs i

692
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,720
thank you

693
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,640
peter and lk for a great job

694
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,240
and we'll with that we will continue now

695
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,679
a

696
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,640
we have a new part of the program uh

697
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
a new aspect of chess and they had the

698
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,919
artwork configuration and i'll hand now

699
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
to the uh chair the artifact evaluation

700
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,400
a

701
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,520
douglas tablet please

702
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,720
great hello everyone um and thanks for

703
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
this chance to tell you about the

704
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,159
artifact review process

705
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
so um for those of you who don't know

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
artifact review is well something new

707
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,520
that the iicr has done so it's a process

708
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
to support open reproducible research

709
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
in experimental computer science and

710
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
software engineering

711
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
and an artifact here is could be a piece

712
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
of software a hardware design a data set

713
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
uh whatever kind of

714
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,760
supports the research beyond what's in

715
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
the paper

716
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
this is something that started to

717
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
develop in software engineering

718
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,559
conferences around 2011 as far as i can

719
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,200
tell and a few years later the acm for

720
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
example established a task force on

721
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,720
reproducibility and developed a badging

722
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
system that they use on their artifacts

723
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
but this is the first time we've done it

724
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,559
at an iacr conference it's an idea

725
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
that's been kicking around since at

726
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
least 2019 and discussions with a few

727
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
people around the iser

728
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
but for chess 2021

729
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,200
i have a huge kudos to elka and peter

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
for deciding to initiate this

731
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
and also thank them for giving me the

732
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
opportunity to lead it

733
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,320
um so we know what makes a good paper

734
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,919
but what makes a good artifact uh and in

735
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
some sense it's kind of i know it when

736
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
i'll see it but we can we can put down

737
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,000
some criteria we'd like an artifact to

738
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480
be well documented it should be clear

739
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,039
what the purpose of the artifact is what

740
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,960
you need to be able to build it and run

741
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
it how to execute it

742
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,520
and they're also you know good code is

743
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
well documented code as well

744
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
we'd like it to be well organized

745
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,960
and we'd like the output to be easily

746
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
interpreted so that whatever the person

747
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,039
evaluating or trying to reproduce the

748
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,200
results looking at the artifact can

749
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,520
connect that back with uh what was

750
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,919
actually in the original paper

751
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,520
and ideally it would also be easy to

752
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
modify and extend so that uh you know we

753
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,279
can build on it in future research

754
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,080
or you know if this isn't uh one this is

755
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,200
one way of looking at what makes a good

756
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
artifact another way that i came back to

757
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,360
a few times through this process is to

758
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,000
imagine a first year graduate student in

759
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,159
five to ten years being asked by their

760
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,679
supervisor to try and run your code and

761
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,760
then extend it are they likely to

762
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
succeed uh how can we might make their

763
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
life easier now for the purposes of

764
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,840
enhancing research in the future

765
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,360
so the goal of our artifact review

766
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,320
process was to improve the functionality

767
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
and reusability of artifacts to enable

768
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
reproducibility and extensibility by the

769
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,159
scientific community and then archive

770
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,200
these

771
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,760
and they're actually a more uh extensive

772
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
set of goals that are possible for

773
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,840
artifact review um in the acm system and

774
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
others that i've put a link to here in

775
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
case you're more in case you're curious

776
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,200
about what uh what else we could be

777
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,080
doing

778
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
i do want to mention uh something about

779
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
these terms reproducibility and

780
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,440
replicability

781
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
because this was actually something that

782
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,159
i didn't understand the difference

783
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,840
between before i started this process so

784
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,360
reproducibility is where the scientific

785
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,120
results that are claimed to have been

786
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
obtained have been

787
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
verified by a different team but using

788
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
the original author's artifacts

789
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
so using your source code someone else

790
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,039
verifies the results

791
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,159
this is slightly different from

792
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,720
replicability where the results have

793
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,440
been uh replicated by a different team

794
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,279
without the use of author-supplied

795
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
artifacts so if you claimed that it's

796
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
possible to carry out a certain type of

797
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,559
an attack reproducibility is reproducing

798
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,360
the attack with your software and

799
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,679
replicability someone else

800
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,399
re-implementing it based on your paper

801
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,559
but with their own tools and trying to

802
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,200
reproduce the result

803
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
now in in this process here we didn't

804
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,960
aim to

805
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,279
actually reproduce or replicate the

806
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,000
scientific claims of the paper and this

807
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,480
is because we did artifact review after

808
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,200
acceptance by the chess 2021 program

809
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,640
committee so we're assuming that they've

810
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
done their job and you know verified the

811
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,399
scientific aspects what we were trying

812
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,960
to do in this process was run the

813
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
artifacts check that they produced

814
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,440
output that could be used to assess the

815
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
claims the paper in the paper and then

816
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,320
artifact and then archive them um but

817
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
it's up to the the program committee and

818
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
the subsequent scientific community to

819
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
address reproducibility and

820
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,880
replicability

821
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
okay so our process um that we applied

822
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
for each of the four chest cycles was to

823
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,240
issue a call for artifacts um requiring

824
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
artifacts to be submitted approximately

825
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
one month after the paper had been

826
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
notified that it had been accepted to

827
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,480
teach us around the same time as the

828
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,799
the camera ready version was due

829
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,120
authors would submit to a special hot

830
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,559
crp instance

831
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
a copy of their paper the source code

832
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
for their artifact a list of the tools

833
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
that are required to evaluate it

834
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,320
a readme describing all this information

835
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
and a few other pieces of metadata

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
including whether there are any patented

837
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
technologies involved here in case some

838
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,799
of our uh review committee members are

839
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,960
part of companies whose policies require

840
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,240
them not to

841
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
look at patented technologies

842
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
we then do the bidding process by our

843
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,559
review committee members and for

844
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,399
artifact review especially i think

845
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,480
bidding is really important because uh

846
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,960
very specialized tools may be required

847
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,399
in order to be able to evaluate the

848
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,360
artifact

849
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,320
properly

850
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,840
then we assign three reviewers per

851
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,240
artifact and this is a good chance for

852
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
me to thank

853
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,000
our 33-member artifact review committee

854
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
who i list here

855
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,919
as well as the three external reviewers

856
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,919
who helped us out with artifacts we

857
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
needed special expertise on

858
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,360
um once the reviewers had been assigned

859
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
uh we had an interactive evaluation

860
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,399
period that lasted six weeks or so and i

861
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
say interactive here because we designed

862
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,399
the process to allow reviewers to

863
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,559
directly interact with authors during

864
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,480
the entire review process

865
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,080
to get assistance re running and

866
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,640
debugging the artifact so uh this wasn't

867
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
just like a single rebuttal but uh it

868
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,159
could happen through the whole process

869
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,080
because uh we didn't want our reviewers

870
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,799
to get stuck and spend hours debugging a

871
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,559
silly statement we could ask the authors

872
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,919
to help with that

873
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,440
in this process the authors were not

874
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,200
anonymous to the reviewers but the

875
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
reviewers were anonymous to the authors

876
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,519
and this was implemented using the hot

877
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,519
crp comment system which can be

878
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,880
configured to allow this uh interactive

879
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
commenting

880
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
our reviewers were asked to submit a

881
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
review on touching on aspects like

882
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,679
whether they're able to run it interpret

883
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,320
the artifact output

884
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,840
whether it would be easy to reuse and

885
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
whether the artifact is ready for

886
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
archiving leading to decisions involving

887
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,399
accepting accepting the shepherding

888
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,880
a more substantial revise and resubmit

889
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,600
or rejection

890
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
now in terms of statistics as elka and

891
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,000
peter said there are 78 papers accepted

892
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,399
to chess 2021 so that's our starting

893
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,200
point of these 78 24 submitted artifacts

894
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,679
and after the review process 22 were

895
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,159
accepted for archiving uh four of those

896
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,480
after shepherding and the remaining two

897
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,200
were asked to revise and resubmit

898
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
and the requested revisions primarily

899
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,000
focused about improved documentation

900
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,519
but in these two cases the authors

901
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,840
declined to make those revisions

902
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,919
primarily due to time constraints on

903
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,240
their side and so the artifacts were not

904
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
accepted for archiving

905
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,159
now

906
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,120
you might wonder if it is bad to have a

907
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,519
90 something percent accept rate but i

908
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,360
think traditional metrics about

909
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,519
acceptance rate aren't really meaningful

910
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,519
here we're only reviewing artifacts for

911
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
papers that have already been accepted

912
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,039
so they've already met a certain bar of

913
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,000
quality

914
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,159
and our goal of our process is to

915
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,360
archive high quality usable artifacts

916
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,279
associated with these papers so if we're

917
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,080
able to do uh that for 100 of them if

918
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,000
they meet the archiving criteria by the

919
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
end of it i think so much the better so

920
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
i'm not too worried about a high

921
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,840
acceptance rate as long as uh we're

922
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,480
achieving good outcomes in the end

923
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,399
so after acceptance we moved on to

924
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,560
archiving uh so the authors were asked

925
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,918
to supply source code for their

926
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,719
artifacts including a readme file as

927
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,399
well as a license file

928
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,320
um the source code of course and any

929
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
scripts that are needed to build it um

930
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,119
we always archived the source code for

931
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,639
every artifact

932
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,280
but in one case we also archived a large

933
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
virtual machine image with all the

934
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,119
dependencies installed because there

935
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,359
were quite a complex set of dependencies

936
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,760
and we thought that this might be a way

937
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,280
of ensuring that people could uh

938
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,839
continue to run this in the future even

939
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
if some dependencies become unavailable

940
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,560
an important aspect of archiving was

941
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
dealing with copyright licensing so we

942
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,079
provided authors the choice of what

943
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,239
license to use for their artifact um and

944
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,399
you can see a variety of licenses chosen

945
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,040
here uh by the authors including uh one

946
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,280
that only allows non-commercial use

947
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,240
um

948
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,599
uh because some of the authors are

949
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
coming from corporate environments um we

950
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,440
did require that authors submit a

951
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
copyright form granting the icr the

952
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,599
right to distribute the artifact and

953
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,520
that they accounted for any third-party

954
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,599
sources that are included in their

955
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,920
license and in their in their artifact

956
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
because often artifacts do involve uh a

957
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
variety of sources from different uh

958
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,359
from different locations

959
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,000
so the uh artifacts are archived

960
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
permanently uh if you go to the

961
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
transactions of chess website you'll see

962
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,400
that for papers that have artifacts

963
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
there's a nice artifacts button that you

964
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
can click on showing that these authors

965
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,079
have put in the work to create an

966
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,320
archived artifact that'll take you to

967
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,960
the new

968
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,320
artifacts.iacr.org website um where for

969
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,880
each artifact there's a page listing the

970
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,240
artifact um and it includes uh the

971
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
readme file the source code a link to

972
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,200
the repository on github as well as

973
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,000
licensing information

974
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,599
so um i'd like to

975
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,440
thank the authors and the reviewers for

976
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,359
being very flexible as we created this

977
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,680
process uh and of course really diligent

978
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
work by the reviewers who made real

979
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,960
efforts to run the artifacts and if

980
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,480
you've ever tried to run someone else's

981
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
code you know that that's not always

982
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,359
easy

983
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,880
and also thank you to the authors for

984
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,119
responding to comments um the

985
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,560
interactive comment process was really

986
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,040
very helpful for our reviewers

987
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
we received generally favorable

988
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
favorable feedback on the process and it

989
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,160
went much more smoothly than i had

990
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
feared actually so i was i was pleased

991
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,280
to

992
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,480
see everyone participating in good faith

993
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
um at the end of this um you know what

994
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
is a good artifact i'm not sure i can

995
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
definitively say

996
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,839
but i think the artifacts that we have

997
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,000
archived uh were improved by the process

998
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,839
is this process worthwhile

999
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,960
i think there certainly are clear

1000
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
benefits to artifact review and

1001
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,200
long-term archiving i think it's too

1002
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,040
soon to tell whether the benefits truly

1003
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,640
outweigh the cost

1004
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
but i think the process went well and

1005
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,240
i'm optimistic that they do um and i'm

1006
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
heartened to see that this process will

1007
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,960
continue for chess 2022 and it's in good

1008
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,160
hands with

1009
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
martin albrecht as the artifact review

1010
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,160
chair so if you're planning on

1011
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,560
submitting to uh chess 2022 i do

1012
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,800

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,839
virtual setting um right so it's the

1056
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,760
moment to thank people

1057
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,440
who put energy and dedication into the

1058
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,839
various tasks and jobs you know that

1059
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,440
eventually lead to this successful

1060
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,680
conference that we all can enjoy

1061
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,200
if it's virtual some of the tasks are

1062
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
different some stay the same

1063
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,560
um

1064
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
some people have actually worked for

1065
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,839
this conference already for a year now

1066
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,880
it's

1067
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,119
in particular the program shares right

1068
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,000
really

1069
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,599
started even more than a year ago when

1070
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,359
they drafted their first course of

1071
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,720
papers

1072
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,960
others um were probably invite rather

1073
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
invited rather recently to serve as

1074
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,440
program chairs um or hosts of various

1075
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,680
sessions and so on uh sorry a session

1076
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,040
shares or hosting other sessions um

1077
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
so that's the moment where we want to

1078
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
thank all of them i can peter did a

1079
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,880
really great job at that so i'll just um

1080
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,640
you know join the queue and say thanks

1081
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
to all of them but i would like to

1082
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,320
mention a few key persons in particular

1083
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,160
um yeah without whom the conference

1084
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,400
would simply not have been possible

1085
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
and um usually if this was a physical

1086
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,200
conference then i would now ask those

1087
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
people to come to the stage uh to be in

1088
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,400
front with me and i would ask everybody

1089
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,720
to give a warm round of applause

1090
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,560
and i would hand over some certificates

1091
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,359

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
the time zone issue

1180
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,640
so they submit they give us several

1181
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,599
videos to share their experience

1182
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,160
so i'm going to also share a video to

1183
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
you guys and in this video there are

1184
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,880
three parts so first part is

1185
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,760
uh the introduction for the hack chest

1186
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,560
events uh it's done by myself and also

1187
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,720
there are two videos from the winner for

1188
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,800
their uh experience

1189
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,119
so when i share this video i'm going to

1190
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,599
turn on turn off my camera because there

1191
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,319
is another meeting in this video yeah

1192
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,240
so

1193
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,839
yeah let's

1194
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,078
get started

1195
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,560
ah sorry just a quick question can you

1196
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,000
hear the voice from the presentation

1197
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,880
nope

1198
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,400
okay then maybe

1199
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,640
i will i need to make a presentation

1200
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,880
live and

1201
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,720
we will we will post

1202
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,599
the

1203
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,359
video from the

1204
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,800
participants

1205
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,240
on our website

1206
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,400
okay

1207
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,280
okay

1208
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,359
so uh as i mentioned my name is chen i'm

1209
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,760
a second year phd student so welcome to

1210
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,119
the discussion for the hacker chess

1211
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,480
competition

1212
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,640
and then so first i want to specialist

1213
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,359
thanks for those people to help us

1214
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,680
organize this competition uh for people

1215
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,920
from geodumpster and also people from

1216
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,160
intel corporation

1217
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,480
and so first i will i would like to give

1218
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,880
you a brief introduction for the history

1219
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,520
of the hack competition and also the

1220
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
reason why we want to organize this

1221
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
competition

1222
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,079
okay

1223
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:28,800
so

1224
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
we first

1225
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,640
handled this hacker competition in 2018

1226
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,960
during the dec conference

1227
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,200
and our focus is on

1228
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
the vulnerability exploitation

1229
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,280
so which means when an author find a bug

1230
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,119
from the design we provide

1231
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,800
they also need to develop an exploit

1232
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,200
program to show the effectiveness of the

1233
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,880
bug

1234
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,520
and will will explore their box

1235
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
submission based on the type of bug they

1236
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,920
have found and also the type of exploits

1237
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,359
they provide

1238
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,200
and in this year we actually provide

1239
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,760
three different hack events

1240
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,359
so traditionally one hacked at deck and

1241
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,240
also

1242
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,839
there's another one just end in last

1243
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,319
month which is called the hacksack

1244
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,560
which is co-located with the usernext

1245
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,000
conference

1246
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,839
so our purpose to handle this

1247
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,640
competition um is first we want to raise

1248
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,040
the bar for the hardware security in the

1249
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,880
semiconductor industry

1250
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
and also we want to promote the

1251
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,720
automation tool development

1252
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,240
for the bug detection in hardware

1253
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,119
okay

1254
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,079
so usually there are two phases in each

1255
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,119
event

1256
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
so for the first event we will provide a

1257
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
buggy soc to the participants

1258
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,640
and we and they will have three months

1259
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,359
to get familiar with the design of the

1260
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,839
soc and also the setup of the soc

1261
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,960
so

1262
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,000
usually our strategy strategy is

1263
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,119
first we will pick an open source

1264
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,400
system on chip

1265
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
and at this time we pick the open button

1266
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
that is developed by the people from

1267
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,400
princeton university

1268
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,240
and then we will add some features on

1269
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,920
this soc

1270
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,720
so

1271
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,400
those features include

1272
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,599
the hardware peripherals and also

1273
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,359
how each peripheral communicate with

1274
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,400
each other

1275
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
and once we have finished the system

1276
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,839
design then we begin to insert some club

1277
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,160
okay so in this procession in this

1278
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
presentation i'm going to use bug

1279
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,839
instead of vulnerability to ease my

1280
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,400
friends to ease my presentation

1281
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,480
so

1282
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,880
so the bug we insert in the system are

1283
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,800
usually inspired by the common weakness

1284
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
enumeration so which means they are

1285
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,079
usually from our real-life

1286
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,920
vulnerabilities

1287
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,880
and

1288
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
once the participants submit their bug

1289
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,880
submission with the exploits we are

1290
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,400
going to evaluate

1291
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,960
the submission based on the type of bug

1292
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,040
and also based on the exploit they

1293
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,280
provide

1294
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,160
okay so here is a high level picture of

1295
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,240
the associated with the feature in alpha

1296
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,359
phase

1297
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,480
so the core of the soc is a very popular

1298
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,280
open source risk five so uh core which

1299
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,960
is called aryan

1300
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,359
and we will also add several

1301
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,240
hardware peripherals such as those

1302
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,200
very

1303
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,800
very popular

1304
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,319
crypto engine

1305
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,280
and also we have some peripherals like

1306
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
render number generator

1307
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,000
and we will also have the fuse memory uh

1308
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,760
the fuse memory are usually used to

1309
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,240
store the sensitive information of those

1310
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
peripherals

1311
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
okay

1312
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,160
and after we finish the design after we

1313
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,839
finish adding the feature we will begin

1314
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,000
to insert the book so usually there are

1315
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,520
two types of bug

1316
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,240
one type of bug is

1317
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,160
the bucket that we manually insert in

1318
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,319
those designs and another bar another

1319
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,960
type of bug is called the non-insert bug

1320
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,119
so for those bugs they are

1321
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,359
are usually intrinsic bug

1322
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,280
they usually are either fine by

1323
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,359
ourselves or find by the participants

1324
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,480
during the competition

1325
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,359
okay

1326
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,480
so

1327
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,800
in the second phase so for this phase it

1328
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,520
usually happened during the conference

1329
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,079
and the participants will have around 48

1330
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,119
hours

1331
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,400
to

1332
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,800
try to detect bug as many as they can

1333
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,160
so in the beta phase based on the bucket

1334
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,960
soc from we provide in the alpha phase

1335
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,440
we will add new features so first one we

1336
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,599
will add the standard 2048 bits

1337
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,599
rsa crypto engine

1338
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,960
and we also add a reset controller which

1339
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,800
is used to control and send the reset

1340
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,000
signals to all other peripherals

1341
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,040
and also we move our entire buggy soc

1342
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,920
setup to the aws platform

1343
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,760
so

1344
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,440
in this case the reason there are two

1345
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,520
reasons that we do in this case the

1346
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,680
first reason is because

1347
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,800
we observe so in previous

1348
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,440
hack competition we observed that

1349
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,280
most teams are

1350
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,599
spend a lot of time to figure out to fix

1351
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,680
the environment issue and also they need

1352
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,920
to spend a lot of time to install those

1353
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
complicated tool chain in order to run

1354
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,599
our buggy soc

1355
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,599
so in this case we don't want them to

1356
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,760
spend those time on

1357
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,079
those unnecessary stuff we want we want

1358
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,640
them to directly jump to the debug

1359
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,960
process so in this case we

1360
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,200
provide for each team we directly

1361
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,480
provide them a fully set up aws instance

1362
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,880
and another reason is because

1363
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,839
to if we

1364
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,480
use uh run the simulation

1365
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,599
to verify the exploit using some like

1366
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,000
variator or moto sync those simulation

1367
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
tools it usually takes like around 10

1368
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,520
minutes

1369
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,720
to run one exploit and this time we

1370
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,599
think is kind of long for the only for

1371
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,319
the 48 hours competition so we also

1372
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,440
synthesize the soc design and we provide

1373
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,920
fpga emulation in the cloud so in this

1374
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,839
case the time for them to verify one

1375
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:08,880
exploit

1376
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,640
uh reduced from 10 minutes to 10 seconds

1377
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,720
so and also because we synthesize the

1378
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,200
soc there are actually

1379
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,319
more bugs inside the soc design can be

1380
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,440
find

1381
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,760
used using the synthesizer version so

1382
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,280
which gives participants more chance

1383
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,160
to

1384
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
submit their bugs

1385
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,520
okay so based on the results there are

1386
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,160
we select two winners

1387
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,640
so the first winner is the team i'll be

1388
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,839
the tiger

1389
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,280
they have fun 11 bucks in 48 hours and

1390
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,359
the second winner is team lucky meal

1391
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,440
they have to find seven bucks

1392
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,200
and also we think the most interesting

1393
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,640
bug we want to mention in this

1394
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,280
competition is funded by the team of the

1395
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,359
tiger they find some risky perimeter

1396
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,119
polynomial of the random number

1397
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,359
generator

1398
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,760
okay so here are the details

1399
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,640
for the honorable detection from the

1400
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,440
team

1401
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,119
so team rb the tiger

1402
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,720
they first find

1403
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
that the rsa engine that we use can

1404
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,839
generate one as an encryption key so

1405
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,240
which means if the user use

1406
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,040
this

1407
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
is a engine to encrypt our plan tax then

1408
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,800
they will have a stem then the cipher

1409
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
text they get will be the same as their

1410
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,720
plaintext so which is definitely not

1411
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,520
good

1412
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,839
and also they find that

1413
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:30,800
um

1414
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,960
in the random number generator because a

1415
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,440
random generator is developed based on

1416
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,200
the linear

1417
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,960
uh linear shift feedback register so

1418
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
they realize there is one entropy source

1419
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
of the random number generator that use

1420
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,680
zero as the primitive polynomial which

1421
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,000
means for the finally the output of the

1422
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,960
random number there are the one segment

1423
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,520
of the random number will always be zero

1424
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,240
and also from team lucky meal they

1425
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,640
find that the password that we use to

1426
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,760
encrypt our jtag is only 32-bit which is

1427
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,240
kind of weak because attacker can try to

1428
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,200
uh

1429
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,760
have a brute-force attack on this to

1430
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,520
guess the correct password

1431
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,839
so in this case they suggest us to

1432
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,000
increase the size of the password

1433
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,680
to

1434
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,440
eliminate this

1435
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,599
vulnerabilities

1436
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,240
okay so that's all about our hack chest

1437
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,960
competition and here i also want to let

1438
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
you guys know that there is a new

1439
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,599
hardware design cwes which is published

1440
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,599
in february 20

1441
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,880
and

1442
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,599
actually all most of the

1443
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,400
bugs in the hacker chest are inspired by

1444
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,400
those real life bugs so if you have

1445
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,079
found some new

1446
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,480
bug in the hardware design then feel

1447
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,280
free to submit it to this website or

1448
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,559
either you can let us know

1449
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,599
okay so here is this conclusion

1450
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,240
so we pick an open source soc the open

1451
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,559
button and we add several

1452
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,319
uh security features

1453
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,960
and after that we insert some bugs and

1454
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,359
totally there are seven teams from the

1455
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,359
world

1456
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,359
participate in this competition and

1457
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,040
finally we select two

1458
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,280
winners to share our two thousand dollar

1459
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,319
award

1460
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,480
and in the future couple weeks we plan

1461
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,240
to open source our bucket soc design

1462
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,119
okay so now let's uh

1463
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,520
congrats to the winners of the hacker

1464
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,119
chess 2021 the team avid tiger from the

1465
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,559
university auburn

1466
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,960
from the aubry university usa and also

1467
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,839
the team lucky meal from the company

1468
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:40,960
good x

1469
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,280
okay so again uh if you want to know

1470
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,760
more detail information about this

1471
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,680
comfort about this competition then you

1472
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,839
can go to our website

1473
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,558
the hack at event.org

1474
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,680
okay so thank you and again because um i

1475
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,920
cannot share the video

1476
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,880
from the participants so i will put

1477
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,359
the video on on our website so you can

1478
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,319
check them in detail

1479
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,040
okay thank you very much jim

1480
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,520
and with that we move on to the uh next

1481
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,880
challenge the uh we box a technical wrap

1482
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,160
up in the world

1483
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,400
and this one is being

1484
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
presented by alexey

1485
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,960
vince um

1486
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,119
we don't hear you in case you're talking

1487
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,119
you're probably muted

1488
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,079
now can you hear me

1489
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,559
no

1490
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,960
now can you hear me

1491
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,160
try changing the microphone it's a bit

1492
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,680
low

1493
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,919
no

1494
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,000
uh sorry now can you hear me

1495
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,760
yes thank you

1496
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,119
sorry yes

1497
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,720
they changed the settings

1498
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,880
better than getting a cat face

1499
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,960
so can you can you see the screen

1500
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,440
so uh yes sorry for small delay

1501
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,480
so welcome everybody to the

1502
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,799
award session of the chess 2021

1503
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,160
challenge

1504
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,640
the vbox contest part

1505
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,559
and the reeboks contest this year was

1506
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,040
organized by uh louis gubaan stefan

1507
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,760
kelbel pascal paella mateo ivan

1508
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,640
alexiodevenko and january one

1509
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,640
and we also thank google cloud for

1510
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,400
providing servers

1511
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,040
for the competition

1512
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,280
so what is this contest about

1513
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
the vbox contest is about

1514
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,400
white box cryptography which is very

1515
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,680
roughly speaking

1516
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
about obfuscation of cryptographic

1517
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,839
implementations

1518
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,960
given an implementation that

1519
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,040
accepts the

1520
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,920
secret key as an input and performs a

1521
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,079
certain cryptographic operation

1522
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,000
such as encryption or digital signature

1523
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,400
a white box compiler produces an

1524
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
implementation that has

1525
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,079
the secret key hard coded inside it

1526
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,760
and then the minimal security

1527
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
requirement is that this key should be

1528
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,720
hard to extract from the white box

1529
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,200
implementation

1530
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,520
unfortunately for a long time all

1531
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,520
publicly available schemes

1532
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,839
for standard primitives such as is or

1533
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,760
ecdsa so all white box designs are

1534
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,200
broken by practical attacks

1535
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,280
but on the other hand in the industry

1536
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,880
there are many applications such as

1537
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,640
mobile payments or digital right

1538
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,799
management

1539
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,880
and currently the industry relies on

1540
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,400
secret designs

1541
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,520
so and a natural question is

1542
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,119
how secure can be this approach

1543
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,200
so this question serves as a motivation

1544
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,839
for the vbox contests

1545
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,040
the idea is to confront designers and

1546
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,559
attackers

1547
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,440
of practical white box cryptography

1548
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,960
and the overall scenario is as follows

1549
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,359
designers submit a white box

1550
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,599
implementation written in c

1551
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,040
which can be somehow obfuscated

1552
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,280
and then the attackers try to break

1553
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,599
available implementations by extracting

1554
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,000
their secret keys

1555
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,680
and this is already

1556
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,920
the third edition of the ubox contests

1557
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,960
the first edition from 2017

1558
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,079
targeted whitebox as

1559
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,720
and to briefly summarize the contest

1560
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,359
there were some tough submissions

1561
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,760
by contestants but they all got broken

1562
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,599
during the competition

1563
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,559
so we can conclude that the attackers

1564
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,839
have won the the first

1565
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,400
edition the second edition in 2019

1566
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,040
again charged white box as

1567
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,400
but now a few implementations uh

1568
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,319
were hard enough to stay unbroken during

1569
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,000
the competition

1570
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,760
but they were broken briefly afterwards

1571
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
nonetheless we can say that the

1572
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,200
designers have

1573
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,240
won this

1574
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,640
second edition

1575
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,040
and this year the third edition

1576
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,240
the contest is more experimental the

1577
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,079
target was changed to ecdsa signatures

1578
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:50,880
so

1579
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,319
how well did it go this time

1580
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,200
before mentioning the results i'll

1581
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,799
briefly

1582
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,079
remind the the rules of the contest

1583
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,319
so a newly submitted implementation

1584
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,680
starts to accumulate strawberry points

1585
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,520
until it gets broken

1586
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,200
and after that

1587
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,839
the points start to decrease to zero

1588
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,480
symmetrically

1589
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,400
the attacker that breaks implementation

1590
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,520
gets banana points equal to the number

1591
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,280
uh to the current number of strawberry

1592
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,839
points of the implementation

1593
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,640
but

1594
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,799
for for each user only the best attack

1595
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,359
or the best implementation is counted so

1596
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,160
this is done to prevent spamming of

1597
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,200
same implementations

1598
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,280
so it is sufficient to break the the

1599
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,520
strongest implementation or

1600
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,359
to provide strongest implementation to

1601
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,240
win the contest

1602
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,000
and also implementations are

1603
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,720
distinguished by different performance

1604
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,520
so

1605
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,200
we

1606
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,760
we take into account the time the

1607
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,280
execution time

1608
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
of the implementation the program size

1609
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
the compiled program size

1610
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,119
and the arm usage of the implementation

1611
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,000
and the hard limits for for the

1612
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,680
performance are three seconds per

1613
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,960
signature

1614
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,119
20 megabytes of the program size and 20

1615
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,400
megabytes of ram usage

1616
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,680
so

1617
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,040
we can see how

1618
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,240
the contest went by looking through the

1619
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,000
how strawberry scores evolved over time

1620
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,760
the contest was leave for about three

1621
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,720
months

1622
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,559
it starts middle may until end of august

1623
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,280
and it was followed by a few extra weeks

1624
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,119
which only allowed attacks on the

1625
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,839
implementations

1626
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,160
and we can see that no submission scored

1627
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,720
more than one strawberry

1628
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,079
before the

1629
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,440
last two weeks

1630
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,880
of the

1631
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,160
competition

1632
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,240
while while the winning

1633
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,280
challenge has about 20 strawberries

1634
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,520
in fact there were many

1635
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,599
submissions in the beginning

1636
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,680
but they were broken very quickly and so

1637
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,680
the peaks are not visible here

1638
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:15,520
but

1639
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,359
there were a few strong contestants in

1640
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,599
the last one half weeks and if we

1641
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,559
zoom in the last one half weeks we can

1642
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,440
see that a few candidates were fighting

1643
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,319
for

1644
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,160
for the top places in the scoreboard

1645
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,640
but unfortunately all of them were

1646
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,680
broken

1647
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,880
and each

1648
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,000
within less than two days

1649
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,799
so

1650
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,599
we can conclude that the attackers

1651
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,880
have won this

1652
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,760
edition of the reeboks

1653
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,640
for a bit of statistics

1654
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,039
there were 97 accepted challenges in

1655
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,319
total

1656
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,480
29 of which were created by one account

1657
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,640
but the other teams were more moderate

1658
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,880
in their submissions

1659
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,799
and here in bold

1660
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,280
are the authors of the top 10 strongest

1661
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,319
challenges

1662
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,680
so we can see that most of them

1663
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,039
submitted

1664
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,079
only one or two strong candidates

1665
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,640
except that in august who submitted five

1666
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,759
implementations in total

1667
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,240
here we can see how the number of

1668
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,400
challenges evolved over time

1669
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,920
in the beginning there were quite a lot

1670
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,440
of submissions

1671
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,359
but they were quickly broken so we can

1672
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,400
guess that this cooled down the authors

1673
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,039
and for them to spend more time to craft

1674
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,599
some strong implementations

1675
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,359
which were mostly submitted closer to

1676
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,200
the deadline to the final submission

1677
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,598
deadline

1678
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,240
and again similar statistics for attacks

1679
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,839
there are in total

1680
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,680
almost 900 breaks unique breaks

1681
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,480
and a few teams managed to break almost

1682
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,480
all challenges but nobody actually

1683
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,559
managed to achieve this goal

1684
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,760
so among 97 challenges

1685
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,520
one team broke 92 this is the best

1686
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,119
so we can highlight

1687
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,760
impressive results by the teams the real

1688
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,960
eye defects august

1689
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,599
who were very close to breaking all

1690
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,720
challenges

1691
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,720
but i recall that the number of broken

1692
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,280
challenges was not relevant for for the

1693
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,599
winning criteria

1694
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,000
and here in bold uh other teams who were

1695
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,680
the first to break

1696
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,440
at least one of the ten strongest

1697
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,440
implementations

1698
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,960
here's the graph for the attacks over

1699
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,240
time

1700
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,440
it mostly follows the graph of

1701
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,039
submissions so in the beginning there

1702
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:51,920
was a

1703
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,520
lot of activity

1704
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,720
because there are many wicket

1705
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,119
limitations that were easy to break and

1706
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,440
people use this

1707
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,119
and then there are

1708
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,119
a small spike in the attacks close to

1709
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,440
the end to finish the

1710
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,440
final

1711
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,000
submissions

1712
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,000
so we are now ready to announce the

1713
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,079
winners and we start with a design

1714
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,359
podium

1715
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,440
so on the slide you can see the top five

1716
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,880
implementations

1717
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,200
with their peak strawberry scores

1718
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,720
and the third place goes to team mcs

1719
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,880
who decided to stay anonymous at least

1720
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,720
so far

1721
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,400
their implementation survived attacks

1722
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,119
for almost 24 hours

1723
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:38,559
and they will receive the cash price of

1724
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,599
100

1725
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,520
but only if they will come out of the

1726
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,200
anonymity

1727
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,440
so we congratulate them with the third

1728
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,880
place

1729
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,319
second place goes to team august

1730
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,119
comprised of tobias dumb max gephardt

1731
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,839
aaron gore dominick lane denis coogler

1732
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:59,359
frederick laos johannes mittman

1733
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,880
vivian diehl

1734
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,119
from bundeslamp for zika height

1735
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,599
germany

1736
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,799
the implementation survives for 21 hours

1737
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,520
but it beats the one by mcs because of

1738
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,599
its better performance

1739
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,559
so they will win a cash price of 200.

1740
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,680
congratulations to tim august

1741
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,119
and the winner of the design podium is

1742
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,559
team ziroki

1743
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,839
comprised of adrian rania ward burens

1744
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,400
john ryuchi

1745
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,359
from q11 and mohammad mazun from

1746
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,240
eindhoven university of technology

1747
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,359
the implementation survived for 33 hours

1748
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,760
and they win a cash prize of 500

1749
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,319
for their tough challenge so

1750
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,759
congratulations to all the winners

1751
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,400
we now move on to the attackers podium

1752
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,640
you can see the top 10 teams

1753
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,599
by the strongest changes that they broke

1754
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,480
and one of the rules of the contest was

1755
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,880
that the winners of the winning side get

1756
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,200
a bonus to their cash prizes

1757
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,319
so

1758
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,160
since all challenges were broken during

1759
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,640
this competition this year

1760
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,400
the attacker's podium gets increased

1761
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,880
prices compared to the designer's module

1762
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,119
and so the third place goes to

1763
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:23,920
team

1764
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,640
the real idfix

1765
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,720
which is the cryptography and security

1766
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,359
team of academia

1767
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,359
impressively they also broke the largest

1768
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,960
number of challenges

1769
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,839
in 92 out of 97

1770
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,160
so missing only five of them

1771
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,839
and they win 150 dollars

1772
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,640
congratulations to the third place

1773
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,440
the second place goes to

1774
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,200
again team august from bsi germany

1775
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,119
who have won the second place in the

1776
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,280
designer's podium as well

1777
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,200
so they get three hundred dollars more

1778
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,640
for

1779
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,240
their extensive clips analysis

1780
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,799
and congratulations again

1781
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,480
and finally the

1782
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,400
attacking winner is

1783
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,839
uh

1784
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,799
team banana ramadama

1785
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,479
consisting of

1786
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,279
hermann drexler schwein bauer from

1787
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,279
giseke undivid

1788
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,560
mobile security from munich

1789
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,279
they win the main cash price of 750

1790
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,319
dollars

1791
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,479
for breaking the hardest challenge

1792
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,158
from the winning designers team zero key

1793
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,799
so congratulations to all the winners

1794
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,759
and to conclude the contest

1795
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,439
every challenge was broken in less than

1796
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,359
two days

1797
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,640
showing that

1798
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,359
while box implementations of ecdsa are

1799
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,839
very hard

1800
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,679
for now we can only claim that for for

1801
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,399
the given resource constraints

1802
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,198
so a natural continuation of the contest

1803
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,479
would be to

1804
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,319
to allow more resources

1805
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,080
for designers to implement stronger

1806
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,600
quantum errors

1807
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,520
so please stay tuned for for next

1808
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,640
editions of the v box contests

1809
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,560
yeah and with this i thank you for your

1810
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,319
time and congratulate all the winners

1811
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,279
again

1812
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,679
thank you

1813
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,880
thank you very much alexa and the

1814
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,640
congratulations to all the winners and

1815
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,120
to all participants

1816
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,960
and with that we move to the next

1817
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
presentation and

1818
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,719
the presenter is a

1819
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,238
boeing yang

1820
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:33,759
wanted

1821
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,120
postdocs and your boat

1822
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,520
breed

1823
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,840
green

1824
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,400
you might be muted

1825
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,159
sorry

1826
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,000
i really have two uh

1827
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,159
announcements in one

1828
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,719
but at least i thought the

1829
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,560
title is funny

1830
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,199
i want post docs and i want your votes

1831
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,679
at academia cineca taipei taiwan

1832
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,159
as most of you know taiwan is a great

1833
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,440
place

1834
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,800
i mean we have

1835
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,480
some of the best nature

1836
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,040
and some of the world's best food

1837
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,199
and not a whole lot of the pandemic

1838
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,640
but we are opening a new cyber security

1839
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,640
center of excellence in taipei and

1840
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,159
there's already a few of us

1841
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,040
kaimin chung luba neither hagen and

1842
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,239
myself

1843
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:51,360
and

1844
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,239
two people already accepted the job

1845
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,679
offers

1846
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:56,719
and

1847
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,400
we have competitive

1848
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,480
pay i hope and

1849
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,600
generally flexible and negotiable

1850
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,120
conditions

1851
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,640
and we are post quantum and

1852
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,080

1880
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,719
like to um

1881
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,040
to advertise

1882
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,360
two events happening in november here in

1883
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,080
new mex one is cardist 2021

1884
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,920
um the 20th edition of cardis and the

1885
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,920
other one is the fall school on nano

1886
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,880
electronics for secure systems

1887
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,600
and let's see that i have this working

1888
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,679
correctly yeah so you might wonder why

1889
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,800
you wouldn't want to attend cardis um uh

1890
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,880
this year well obviously you like chess

1891
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
topics that's why you are here and i

1892
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,640
think we can have similar topics

1893
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,120
as at cardis as well you might also

1894
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,520
suffer from zoom fatigue after many

1895
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,760
hours of talks today and you're really

1896
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,480

1897
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,280

that's what um the advertisement is for

1941
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,199
it's actually uh in close to hamburg so

1942
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,120
in in northern europe it's fairly easy

1943
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,280
to reach there is an uh airport here in

1944
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,920
lubeck as well only servicing a few of

1945
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,920
the german-speaking countries

1946
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,760
so southern germany austria and

1947
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,960
switzerland

1948
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,640
then there is hamburg airport which

1949
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,159
which is a bigger international airport

1950
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,679
quite easy to reach you can easily get

1951
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,360
there by train there's good trained

1952
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,960
connections um

1953
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,120
and if you're from northern europe on

1954
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,199
baltic countries you can also come by

1955
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:26,719
ferry

1956
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,880
um why should you come well of course

1957
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,320
because of the great talks and the

1958
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,840
interaction with other people but you

1959
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,400
can also explore the city which is a

1960
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,040
nice historic old town surrounded by

1961
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,880
water and it attracts a lot of tourists

1962
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,800
every year so it's definitely worth a

1963
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,080
visit

1964
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,159
um the venue itself is also quite nice

1965
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,159
it's conveniently placed close to the

1966
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,880
train station right next to the

1967
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,560
old town so you can also use it as a

1968
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,560
base for exploring

1969
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,040
um it's all yeah it's easy to reach and

1970
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,120
uh we're trying um our best together

1971

2017
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,920
i remind the others that now you can

2018
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,920
vote for this um the best drum station

2019
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,320
talk in this block as well and exercise

2020
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,599
your right to vote

2021
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,840
okay uh here's our reason to work and uh

2022
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,640
uh our topic is a correlation tag on

2023
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,760
four so five and the snow six

2024
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,000
uh the first part is a

2025
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,080
brief introduction of the two stream

2026
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,199
ciphers

2027
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,040
the stream cypress note 5 is a new

2028
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,800
member of the snow family it was

2029
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,960
proposed for the 5g

2030
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,320
system

2031
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,960
to achieve the security requirements by

2032
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,800
the 3gpp for 5g system its need for snow

2033
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,679
5 to provide a

2034
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:32,640
256 speed security level with a 256

2035
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,600
speed key recently a faster variant of

2036
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,280
snow 5.26 was proposed

2037
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,719
uh

2038
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,000
the snow 5 stream server consists of

2039
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,080
rfsr part and fsm part and the

2040
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,800
framework was shown in the picture snow

2041
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,840
6 is exactly the same as the 5 with some

2042
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,719
differences in the rfsr part and the tab

2043
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,840
choice of the t2

2044
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,800
so up to now some

2045
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,840
attacks have been proposed

2046
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,679
on snow 5 and snow 6 and we can see in

2047
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,239
the table the first three three i

2048
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,840
implemented

2049
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,719
on

2050
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,679
three reduced variance of snow five and

2051
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,080
we can see that no results on folsom

2052
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,719
5.06 are faster than exhaustive key

2053
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,080
search

2054
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,560
so we do some work on the two stream

2055
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,760
center

2056
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,120
as well

2057
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,320
and there are two stages in our attack

2058
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,400
the first is searching for binary or

2059
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,800
proxy emissions

2060
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,120
so in our paper a method for searching

2061
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,960
correlations between the binary stream

2062
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,560
of lfsr and the key stream of stone 506

2063
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,800
is presented based on the technical

2064
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,679
techniques of composite function

2065
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,880
and we present an automatic search model

2066
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,560
and the search of the binary linear

2067
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,480
approximation between outputs and the

2068
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,719
lfs are states

2069
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,040
and three consecutive clocks with a

2070
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:06,199
correlation 2 to the power minus 47.76

2071
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,719
then the second stage is to recover the

2072
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,280
initial state using such approximation

2073
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,440
we propose a correlation attack on full

2074
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,840
snowy with a

2075
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,360
complexity lower than key exhaustion

2076
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,159
and we proved that the results above

2077
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,599
also hold for snow six

2078
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,679
so to the best of our knowledge this is

2079
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,679
the first efficient attack on false note

2080
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:36,080
5 and so 6 which is better than

2081
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,719
exhaustive key search and our papers had

2082
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,440
been posted on april and archive

2083
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,880
that's it

2084
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,600
thank you for your attention

2085
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,000
thank you very much um so the next

2086
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,960
speaker on the session is um chang thing

2087
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,120
to talk about on zuk 256

2088
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,960
so uh come here me

2089
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,600
weekend hello uh

2090
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,080
okay

2091
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,520
let me

2092
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,199
okay

2093
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,159
this is

2094
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,840
some information on 2256 and i'm chung

2095
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,280
from ctt beijing china and the ctt is a

2096
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,679
vendor

2097
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,520
two algorithm became 3gpp specifications

2098
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,639
since

2099
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,000
2011 and in 4g and 5g

2100
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,480
the

2101
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,040
128ea3ei3 and

2102
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,639
128nea3 and nia 3

2103
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,880
is based on two algorithm

2104
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,000
and it is optional to be implemented in

2105
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,520
cgpp

2106
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,880
specification

2107
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,000
but it is monetary to be used

2108
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:52,880
in

2109
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,840
ccsa specification

2110
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,920
so zug

2111
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,520
zug is widely used in china

2112
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,520
and in 2018 3g pv ic3 launcher starting

2113
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,639
item

2114
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,000
on 206 speaks algorithm in 5g

2115
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,239
the tr33

2116
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,719
concluded that the 256-bit algorithm is

2117
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,280
required in future 5g release

2118
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,880
and the cst

2119
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,840
things

2120
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,800
as snow and 2 based 2.6 bit algorithms

2121
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,400
need to be prepared to keep consistency

2122
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,000
and 0.256 is a new algorithm for the

2123
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,719
future use

2124
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,320
and

2125
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,440
there are several papers on the security

2126
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,639
aspects of

2127
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,080
256

2128
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,480
for some results

2129
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,560
we believe distinguished attack on the

2130
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,840
inner states

2131
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,639
cannot be applied because inner states

2132
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,719
are unknown to the attacker

2133
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,400
so

2134
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,440
ct

2135
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,360
think at the reference

2136
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,800
three and four

2137
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,080
cannot challenge the security of zul256

2138
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,760
and we believe

2139
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,800
two two five six is that 2

2140
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,120
5 6 or 256.

2141
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,400
and the 3gpp also discussed the

2142
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,800
algorithm implementation on commodity

2143
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,840
hardware and dedicated hardware

2144
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,159
follow the saves otherwise

2145
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,679
this latest cpu and new instructions

2146
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,600
and took can be

2147
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,080
implemented parallely achieving a very

2148
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,840
high data rate

2149
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,800
and that means 5g requirement

2150
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,199
and and as zug is interrupted in chips

2151
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:42,320
256 is friendly to these

2152
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,880
products and companies

2153
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,639
in addition

2154
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,440
some mobile network operator would like

2155
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,480
suffering

2156
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,440
function to be implemented in dedicated

2157
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,919
hardware

2158
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,400
and ctt currently asked more intelligent

2159
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,360
works on two two five six and the

2160
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,440
security evaluation and implementation

2161
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,719
optimization

2162
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,440
for two two five six are welcome thank

2163
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,599
you

2164
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,840
thank you

2165
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,560
chen and our next speaker who can be

2166
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,080
setting up

2167
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,080
is uh used

2168
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,120
for for foods for shedding fallouts

2169
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,920
many falls

2170
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,080
and i think chang you need to stop

2171
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
sharing your screen

2172
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,560
yes

2173
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,719
thank you

2174
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,600
and we can't hear you uh used i don't

2175
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,679
know if you were muted yourself

2176
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,320
having trouble

2177
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,159
appears to be unmuted

2178
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,320
okay

2179
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,840
oh it's the

2180
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,400
fan of finding which microphone works on

2181
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,559
the computer

2182
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,120
yes

2183
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,920
just we can hear you

2184
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,320
we hear you

2185
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,400
he doesn't hear us

2186
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,280
a one-way communication

2187
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,159
it's hard to invert um

2188
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:13,760
so then i think we move to the next one

2189
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,440
and see if just can come back

2190
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,080
so uh muhammad for on the technical

2191
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,800
flaws in ccc white paper episode 2 out

2192
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,199
of n

2193
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,719
do you hear me

2194
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,480
yes we do okay perfect

2195
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,520
and do you also see the slides now

2196
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,440
we associate them yep

2197
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,560
okay cool great so welcome everyone i am

2198
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,880
osama and i'm going to talk about the

2199
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,360
second episode of the technical flaws in

2200
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,199
ccc white papers

2201
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,080
so

2202
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,760
uh just as a reminder from the first

2203
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,880
episode a very quick uh recap

2204
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,639
confidential computing consortium

2205
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,239
consists of a number of member

2206
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:59,280
organizations um and is the technical

2207
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,719
advisory committee is shared by

2208
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,159
microsoft

2209
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,760
and it released um three white papers

2210
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,760
the first one was confidential computing

2211
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,000
and introduction the second one was so

2212
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,480
called technical analysis and the third

2213
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,040
one is the confidential computing scope

2214
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,400
so these two

2215
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,880
papers white papers are a bit more

2216
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,560
technical and that's why we focus on

2217
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,880
this this is kind of an introductory uh

2218
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,600
and use cases based

2219
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
so what we what we want to

2220
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,320
describe here is basically

2221
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,120
a number of um problems and the first

2222
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,520
one is the unique definition claimed by

2223
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,679
the confidential computing consortium

2224
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,000
and by making this statement

2225
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,600
the confidential computing consortium

2226
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,960
states that

2227
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,080
um

2228
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,760
confidential computing is uniquely

2229
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,800
defined unlike all other terms

2230
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,600
and

2231
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,760
what we can see here the definition here

2232
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,600
is that the protection of data in use by

2233
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,239
performing computation in a hardware

2234
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,719
based trusted execution environment

2235
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,120
from their

2236
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,800
and what we see in the other white paper

2237
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,120
again from the confidential computing

2238
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,560
consortium

2239
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,960
however this contradicts

2240
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,199
very clearly with the definition so we

2241
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,800
do not need to go to

2242
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,320
other uh

2243
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,800
white papers or other literature so that

2244
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,040
even the text of uh confidential

2245
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,199
computing consortium itself contradicts

2246
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,719
because this programmable hardware

2247
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,639
trusted execution environment

2248
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,360
is clearly a subset of this hardware

2249
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,679
trusted execution environments so the

2250
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,520
two papers by the confidential computing

2251
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,679
consortium themselves contradicts each

2252
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:38,639
other

2253
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:40,560
and that's why the claim of

2254
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,080
having a unique definition of

2255
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,080
confidential computing itself is clearly

2256
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,080
false

2257
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,600
okay the second thing that i want to

2258
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,920
talk about is the another claim

2259
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,080
which is kind of weird that

2260
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,120
tpm is a trusted execution environment

2261
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,360
let's see the definition of a

2262
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,199
trusted execution environment

2263
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,880
the confidential computing defines it as

2264
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,719
an environment that provides a level of

2265
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,360
assurance which however is unknown

2266
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,280
of three properties the first one data

2267
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,600
confidentiality data integrity and code

2268
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,880
integrity

2269
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,520
to reason more clearly about that so we

2270
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,280
represented somehow in the layman

2271
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,880
language

2272
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,400
description of

2273
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,560
some set notation this trusted execution

2274
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,400
environment set that you saw in the last

2275
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,520
diagram

2276
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,320
uh satisfies three properties that are

2277
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,719
confidentiality data integrity and code

2278
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,920
integrity so any point in this set

2279
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,239
any point in this trusted execution

2280
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:37,120
environment set satisfies all the three

2281
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,120
properties according to the definition

2282
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,239
of confidential computer consortium

2283
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:43,120
and

2284
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,880
let's see another claim of confidential

2285
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,360
computing consortium which is that this

2286
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,880
tpm lies completely within the set of

2287
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,199
trusted execution environments

2288
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,440
and to represent it

2289
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,159
roughly like that it is tpm is a subset

2290
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,320
of this set trusted execution

2291
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,000
environments

2292
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,920
and now i just want to write the two

2293
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,760
notations again that

2294
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,760
each point in this set satisfies all the

2295
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,320
three properties and dpm according to

2296
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,719
the ccc claim is a subset of trusted

2297
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:16,639
execution environments

2298
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,199
and combining the two what we get is

2299
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,600
that this subset should actually each

2300
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,360
point in the subset should satisfy all

2301
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,440
the three properties

2302
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,199
and let's see a contradiction within

2303
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,800
again the confidential computing

2304
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,679
consortium same paper uh a few pages

2305
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,239
later what this so what they described

2306
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:36,000
in the

2307
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,960
table is that so this row is yes yes yes

2308
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,960
so this is facilitation environment for

2309
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,719
the first three properties that we have

2310
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:43,520
here

2311
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,199
and for the same three properties when

2312
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,600
they talk about dpm this does not

2313
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,199
satisfy the first two properties

2314
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,520
completely and that itself contradicts

2315
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,520
that each point in this does not satisfy

2316
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,159
all the three properties

2317
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,400
okay moving on to the third one the only

2318
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,159
section in the white papers which

2319
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,440
describes

2320
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,480
or reasons logically about

2321
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,080
some things is

2322
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,360
this section um which describes or kind

2323
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,800
of compares the two state execution

2324
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,639
environment with other technologies and

2325
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,560
this table

2326
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,440
and in the reasoning about the secure

2327
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,679
elements and tpm the approach that they

2328
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,480
have taken is to move to talk

2329
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,880
uh only about the tpms as you also see

2330
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,679
from the caption of uh the table as well

2331
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,920
as all the text inside that section

2332
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,360
talks only and only about this tpm

2333
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,440
and there is no reasoning whatsoever

2334
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,199
about secure element

2335
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,480
and we know that we can if we talk about

2336
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,360
or reason about dpm it's valid for dpm

2337
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,920
only it cannot be generalized without

2338
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,800
having extra arguments that

2339
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,960
that it applies also to the generalized

2340
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,000
domain that is the secure elements

2341
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,159
so the logical reasoning would be that

2342
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,880
we talk about or reason about secure

2343
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,280
elements and then talk about

2344
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:05,280
uh specific class for example tpm

2345
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,320
right and so again just another reminder

2346
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,840
for uh the ccc tag that the community

2347
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,480
eagerly awaits the references of the

2348
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,719
survey that the tech performed and has

2349
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,040
been kept confidential until now

2350
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,159
uh

2351
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,880
yeah so these are the references used in

2352
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,400
this presentation

2353
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,719
and yeah thank you very much i hope to

2354
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,400
see you all in the next episode

2355
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,920
thank you muhammad um keep pushing

2356
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,840
so um use do you want to try again

2357
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,120
let's see for hardware uh

2358
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,679
recovered

2359
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,639
yeah i cannot hear

2360
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,840
you yes we can do uh we can try again at

2361
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,880
the end

2362
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,440
so uh moving on now we have uh

2363
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,520
distraction based denial of service with

2364
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,239
colleen and i i think i can announce

2365
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:07,360
that colleen was kind enough to donate

2366
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,159
um chip whisperer nanos to all that in

2367
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,920
these or the speakers in this you know

2368
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,320
they're all that in this story calling

2369
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,400
the speakers in this chessy results

2370
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,320
section so he's playing the oprah and

2371
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,719
giving um the award to everyone

2372
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,719
there you go everyone can get an award

2373
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,159
all right um so welcome i'm going to

2374
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,600
talk to you about distraction-based

2375
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,639
denial of service or db dos as i call it

2376
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,320
um so this is going to be a really great

2377
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,639
thing for industry and potentially for

2378
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:37,280
researchers as well i think

2379
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,000
what we have is we have this issue

2380
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,560
that people are doing this cool research

2381
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,840
on you know important uh products but

2382
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,760
for companies this means they have to

2383
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,840
hope that they get disclosed right ahead

2384
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
of time because otherwise there's going

2385
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,440
to be all these car thieves stealing

2386
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,360
these tesla model x out there in the

2387
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,719
wild now

2388
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:58,800
um and the solution to this right now

2389
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,440
that most people are using is using sort

2390
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,600
of bug bounty type systems right this is

2391
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,440
one of probably the most common methods

2392
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,360
there's all these like hacker one

2393
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,800
and stuff like that trying to manage it

2394
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,239
but it's pretty expensive you have to

2395
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:11,679
manage the bug bound do you have to have

2396
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,760
the money for the bug bounty

2397
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,360
sometimes it makes researchers more

2398
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,280
angry so you'll see lots of bug bounties

2399
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,000
where they don't cover hardware attacks

2400
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,960
um

2401
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,400
and then the researchers say well you

2402
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,239
know i can't even apply for the program

2403
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,320
so i'm just going to release it anyway

2404
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,000
and no matter what you do if it works or

2405
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
not they're still going to disclose it

2406
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,040
anyway

2407
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,040
so what's the solution to this so the

2408
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,920
solution i'm proposing uses something uh

2409
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,760
xkcd if you haven't seen this comment

2410
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,320
before called nerd sniping and basically

2411
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,480
if you show someone a really interesting

2412
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,639
problem and security researchers i think

2413
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,960
fall into this

2414
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,400
what you end up with is they get so

2415
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,000
distracted solving the interesting

2416
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,520
problem they forget about what else they

2417
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,280
were working on

2418
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,440
so what i'm proposing is we use

2419
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,199
distraction

2420
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,440
to do denial of service attack on the

2421
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,679
researchers and prevent them from having

2422
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,840
time to work on the product you care

2423
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,960
about

2424
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,040
and redirect them to something more

2425
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,480
interesting

2426
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,320
so i'm offering nerd sniping as a

2427
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,400
service as a new new thing for these

2428
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,600
companies

2429
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,119
and what i'll do is i'll find

2430
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,119
researchers i know when i find out

2431
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:18,480
they're working on a product that you

2432
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,159
care about i'm going to redirect them to

2433
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,159
something more interesting

2434
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,080
and so this is a really innovative spin

2435
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,400
on some existing business practices so

2436
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,239
you'll you'll find out that it actually

2437
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,760
will work really well it's worked for

2438
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,679
many years in other fields so why not

2439
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:32,960
security

2440
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,119
for a simple fixed monthly cost much

2441
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,840
cheaper than the cost of doing a bug

2442
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,199
mounting program

2443
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,880
i'm going to try to redirect people by

2444
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,800
nerd sniping them to other

2445
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,320
to other products so if you would like

2446
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,639
to be involved in the distraction based

2447
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,639
denial of service let me know if you

2448
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,239
have a team of researchers we can set up

2449
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:52,159
a whole network of this

2450
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,880
and help protect companies against these

2451
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,320
you know these really nasty type of

2452
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,679
attacks using distraction of researchers

2453
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,880
so thanks so much everyone

2454
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:04,960
thank you calling i have i have several

2455
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,480
students i think who would like to be

2456
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,280
more distracted so this will only help

2457
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,159
yeah

2458
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:13,360
so now daemon will talk about how fast

2459
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,320
can high order masking being softer

2460
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,480
and it's a single slide

2461
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,959
i hope you online

2462
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,000
i am uh

2463
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,080
give me just a sec

2464
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,480
thank you

2465
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,639
okay

2466
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:40,719
since i can't show my screen

2467
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,040
that's test123

2468
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,080
oh you're waiting

2469
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,490
[Music]

2470
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,360
there should be a green button share

2471
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,559
your screen yeah

2472
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,480
okay sorry

2473
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,600
um so this is a short hello everyone you

2474
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,560
can see it right now

2475
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,960
hello

2476
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,840
yes yes we can oh okay um this is a

2477
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,159
short presentation to announce the

2478
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,840
publication of the source code of

2479
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,480
european 2017 how fast can high order

2480
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,040
masking be in software this is a long

2481
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,480
time due

2482
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,639
open sourcing this is a john with meteor

2483
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,000
eva

2484
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,760
you can find the source code under

2485
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,360
crypto expert github repository uh

2486
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,040
with the following link

2487
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:54,960
uh the code is composed

2488
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,040
basically of benchmark of most of the

2489
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,600
masking schemes for xboxes and aes prior

2490
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,440
to 2017

2491
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,880
with optimization of each of the

2492
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,119
building blocks field multiplication

2493
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:06,639
secure multiplication with higher

2494
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,880
outdoor masking security box evaluation

2495
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,800
and secure cypher

2496
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,239
you can also find the b slice

2497
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,400
implementation for the aes and prison

2498
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,040
cipher and it took quite some time to

2499
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,800
publish it because i needed to refactor

2500
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,639
it in order to make it portable for

2501
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:21,760
every

2502
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,800
platform and also reproducible in the

2503
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,520
terms of douglas definition

2504
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,360
there is a lot of code and parameters

2505
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,000
you can play with feel free to do so and

2506
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,520
if you have any question

2507
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,960
please contact me

2508
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,119
thank you very much and

2509
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,400
have a nice end of chess

2510
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,400
thank you

2511
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,119
more implementations to break now um

2512
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,480
used

2513
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,199
we can try again

2514
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,119
thank you

2515
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:54,159
you can hear me now yes we hear you yes

2516
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,159
third time the charm unfortunately the

2517
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,000
award session has already been given

2518
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,360
otherwise i would probably have won the

2519
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,400
most awkward room session set up

2520
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,440
um

2521
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,000
so i'd like to talk a little bit about

2522
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,480
fo transformation so fujisaki okamoto

2523
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,000
transformations

2524
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,600
and some recent papers that came out

2525
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,800
um attacking them essentially so i'm the

2526
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,400
one presenting this but this is joint

2527
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,639
work with uh not even joined work but

2528
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,480
there are many people involved

2529
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,880
in this we wrote a nist message a couple

2530
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,239
of weeks ago where there are many more

2531
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,239
references and many more details about

2532
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,920
what i will say now

2533
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,800
you might want to share your screen

2534
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,199
oh okay yes that's a good point

2535
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,199
oops

2536
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,239
i hope this sound doesn't break

2537
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,360
it's a fragile setup

2538
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,960
uh

2539
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,960
powerpoint

2540
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,360
there we go

2541
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:03,440
yes you can see it yeah

2542
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,440
yep yes

2543
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,560
okay thanks

2544
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,639
okay so when you try to design your post

2545
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,679
quantum uh chem key exchange mechanism

2546
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,600
often you run into a situation like this

2547
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,880
you try to

2548
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,119
design an encryption scheme um in a

2549
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,119
corresponding decryption scheme so alice

2550
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:21,600
encrypt something bob decrypt something

2551
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,760
but the problem is often it's not in cca

2552
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,000
secure all right so it can be in cpa

2553
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,400
secure but not in cch so somebody can

2554
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,239
try to modify

2555
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:33,360
the cipher text um and by doing so when

2556
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,400
bob decrypts with this secret key you

2557
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,840
might learn something about the secret

2558
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,760
key depending on the the message that

2559
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,199
comes out

2560
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:43,360
okay and so there's a typical fix for

2561
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,480
this um including proofs of security

2562
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,560
which is called a cca transformation and

2563
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,440
the most well-known is fujisaki okumoto

2564
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,080
and there are many variants of them and

2565
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,880
essentially it's quite simple

2566
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,480
i mean here it's a very simplified

2567
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,360
version but in a simple sense you can

2568
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,880
take your message that comes out of the

2569
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,600
decryption and you can re-encrypt it so

2570
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,400
with some some determinism in there

2571
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,400
um and the ciphertext that comes out you

2572
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,639
compare to the ciphertext that you

2573
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,760
received um if they're equal

2574
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,840
you're happy and desire protector is not

2575
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,840
modified if they're not equal and the

2576
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,800
ciphertext was modified and you just

2577
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,880
abort not releasing any information

2578
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,719
about your secret key

2579
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:28,320
so that works in theory

2580
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,159
but here we're we're tests so we're

2581
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,480
working in practice and so what you can

2582
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
do you can try to subvert this whole

2583
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,719
re-encryption step by just

2584
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,480
trying to do a power attack on the

2585
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,719
message that comes out right so instead

2586
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,800
of bob releasing information about the

2587
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,639
message now you try to learn information

2588
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,800
about it by doing something like a power

2589
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,480
analysis

2590
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,840
and this works

2591
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,000
and has been shown in papers that this

2592
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,159
works

2593
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,639
the downside here and this is what makes

2594
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,320
this attack so strong

2595
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,119
is that this message m prime propagates

2596
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:02,639
all the way through this encryption

2597
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,639
scheme all the way up to this cipher

2598
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,119
text and so instead of just having to

2599
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,440
attack the message you can actually

2600
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,719
attack the whole message and encryption

2601
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,119
at the same time and essentially all you

2602
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,360
have to do is whether when a bit is

2603
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,800
flipped or more is flipped in the

2604
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,800
ciphertext all you have to do is

2605
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,719
determine whether

2606
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,400
the message that comes out has been

2607
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,560
changed at all whether even one bit is

2608
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,920
different

2609
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,000
and because this whole thing propagates

2610
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,760
through the encryption which is a very

2611
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,800
long computation um you have many many

2612
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,239
traces

2613
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,400
and all you do is detect whether

2614
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,480
something has changed or not and so it's

2615
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,560
an extremely powerful attack

2616
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,360
um

2617
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,719
which is very hard to defend against

2618
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,400
um and so how would you defend against

2619
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,719
it you can try masking you can try

2620
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,119
randomization and those work especially

2621
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,639
in theory they work

2622
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,239
but if you want these to work in

2623
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,480
practice your your masking orders have

2624
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,440
to be

2625
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,920
very high uh probably much higher than

2626
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,800
uh one degree of masking or or two or

2627
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,159
maybe even three

2628
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,760
um right so the question that we want to

2629
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,480
ask the research community is um are

2630
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,320
there alternatives for this fujisaki

2631
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,560
okamoto transformation that don't have

2632
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,400
this inherent problem that you give so

2633
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,840
much power to the attacker

2634
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
or maybe there are other ways to deal

2635
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,400
with such issues and still create ncca

2636
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,080
secure camps um and beyond that we also

2637
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,639
urge nist to consider the severity of

2638
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:31,760
this attack

2639
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,560
into their standardization effort um

2640
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,400
because this might become a serious

2641
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,960
bottleneck for for embedded systems for

2642
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,040
for implementing this

2643
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,960
um so yeah that's it thanks

2644
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,199
thank you uh yust uh that was our last

2645
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:53,040
um chezzy result to be presented um now

2646
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,639
that colleen has meddled with the

2647
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,639
election um i don't think there is a

2648
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,159
point of voting anymore but you can

2649
01:43:58,159 --> 01:43:59,040
still

2650
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,560
vote just to show your

2651
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,800
you know to collect popularity and by

2652
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,320
the way colleen is winning so i think

2653
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,719
he's playing a game here um

2654
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,560
and we finished the session with the

2655
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,600
banquet

2656
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,239
so uh luigi wu

2657
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,880
you can um share a screen and we happy

2658
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,520
to hear about

2659
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,199
okay okay it's like your channel let me

2660
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,678
share the screen

2661
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,719
is this okay

2662
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,800
yes you might want to try to put in

2663
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,239
presentation mode exactly yeah

2664
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,920
now the search

2665
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,560
screen is okay right

2666
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,840
yes

2667
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,800
yeah uh ladies and gentlemen good

2668
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,639
morning good afternoon evening

2669
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,480
i'm very happy

2670
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,600
we come to the euro bank with the time

2671
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,800
let us have relax

2672
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,520
even if we are online

2673
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,239
first we would like to have special

2674
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,639
thanks to united speakers

2675
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,040
ask me anything hosts

2676
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,560
