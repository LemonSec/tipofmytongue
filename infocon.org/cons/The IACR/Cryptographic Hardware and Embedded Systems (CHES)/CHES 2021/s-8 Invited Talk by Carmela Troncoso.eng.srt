1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,520
ready to go have a good session

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,520
okay

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,800
um well i'm happy to announce our first

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,599
um invited speaker for chess 2021

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
um cabela trokoso

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,240
will give a talk um she's an assistant

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,720
professor at epfl

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
where she heads the spring lab

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
her research covers a wide range of

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
topics that are essential to enable the

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
development of technology that can be

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
used to build socially responsible

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
systems

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,760
most of our work focuses on analyzing

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
building and deploying secure and

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,559
privacy

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,440
uh

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
preserving systems

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
she has been named 40 under 40 in

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,200
technology by 42 by fortune in 2020 for

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
her work on contact tracing apps i think

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,199
that's where most of us know her from

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,079
um and she will give a talk about

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,559
hardware for privacy engineering so with

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,239
that carella the floor is yours

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,399
thank you very much elkin thank you

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,040
peter for this uh invitation that made

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
me very nervous because as elka said i'm

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,119
a very privacy person i'm an ordinal

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,680
hardwood person

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
uh when they wrote to me i i said you

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
got the wrong address um like why were

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
you inviting me to give the talk at

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
chess

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
and they said well i would really like

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
to have a talk in which somebody brings

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
a new topic and the needs of this new

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,600
topic from the hardware side

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,799
so here is my attempt to reduce that and

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,920
i hope

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,600
i have fulfilled

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
uh what they asked me to do and i really

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
hope that you find this interesting and

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
it actually inspired you to

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
to open your horizons about what kind of

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
of how would you design and decide more

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
things that that us from the privacy

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,600
engineering domain can take

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
as i have to say i'm very sad that the

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
you know chess always happens in very

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
exotic places like japan and things like

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
this and these guys just invited me

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
today that we're talking but uh we'll

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
talk about it some of that

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,439
so why do we do privacy

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
well what is this privacy thing all

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,119
about right we live in this digital

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
world in which more and more all of our

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
interactions are just dealt by digital

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
things well this conference is one

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,080
example right but we do music

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
not anymore on cities but on spotify we

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,440
talk with our oven to ask the oven to

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,599
hit before we're going home

65
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
uh we don't ask for a taxi with hand in

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
the street you ask for an uber and so

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
forth and so forth

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
and all of these technologies we know

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
that you know how they get all of this

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
data but what we do when we do it and we

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
start to feel like we live

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
under the big eye of sorrow

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
and this is uncomfortable but what we

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
really fear like in the movie it's not

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
the eye nobody was trying to destroy the

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
eye we were trying to destroy the ring

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
because the ring the thing that gives

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
the power to dominate it all and that is

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
data that's what happens when we put our

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,480
lives on someone and someone can read

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
our souls when someone with what we like

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
what we do the next thing we're going to

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
do and they can predict it and not only

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
predict it but then also

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,519
influence it and i'm

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,280
thinking for instance about the

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
cambridge analytica facebook scandal

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
where it was like the first time that

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
all of the fears that privacy advocates

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
had said like when someone has a lot of

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
your data they can start

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,799
controlling and manipulating you came

93
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,879
the place and well it happened after

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
that is history

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
and in the words of salaf right

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,799
parts of what makes society a good place

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,720
in which to leave is the extent to which

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
uh it allows people freedom from

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,959
interception orders as i said from

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
manipulation for implications right

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
whenever we want privacy we don't say we

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
want privacy because we don't want

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
people to know our secrets or we don't

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
want people to know we just don't want

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
to hear what they have to say we don't

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
want them to judge us we don't want them

107
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
to change us

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
because they know privacy information so

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
what we really want is to not have the

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
consequences of losing our privacy

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
and indeed a society without privacy in

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
which everything would be known and we

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
would be judged all the time and we

114
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
could be manipulated all the time

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
because everybody knows our deepest

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
wishes could be suffocation it's not a

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,200
place where we want to live so

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
once we all agree we don't want the ring

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
to be built

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,839
um we have a goal the goal is privacy by

121
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,960
design

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,199
and a while ago

123
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
a lot of people back in the in the sense

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,080
this is the hype start everybody was

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
like we want privacy and policymakers

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
started to push this very hard right we

127
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
have here some quotes from the uh data

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
protection office in ontario in canada

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
which was one of the first strong

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,639
proponents of this privacy the design

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,680
concept of here record from the gdpr

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,080
about how you know from the start of the

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,600
system we need to implement appropriate

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
technical organizational measures have

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
the ftc saying that we should

136
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
incorporate substantial privacy

137
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
protection on the practices

138
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
and all of those things all of these

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
things are great and we all love them

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,639
but you know as a privacy engineer and

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
especially when i was working for

142
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
industry and i had a team and people

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
were reading all of these things they

144
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880
were looking at me and it was really

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
like okay this really feels like this

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
uh you know

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
he just assists them now with the

148
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
freaking privacy on it

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
and

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
so with with them with my colleagues

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
claudia and said a while ago we started

152
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
to think about how can we help engineers

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
to move from the

154
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,919
circles to the o

155
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,919
and in the beginning uh we published a

156
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,680
paper that says that it was all about

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
data minimization what we do is to build

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
systems without data because the least

159
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
data that is in the system the more

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,039
privacy preserving it is and this was

161
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
very celebrated and people like it very

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
much especially on the on the policy

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
side because it was clearly related to

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
data protection regulation principle the

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
principle of data minimization

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,919
and everybody could understand this but

167
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
when we're working a bit further on on

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
how to articulate what we do to build

169
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
systems we discover that really data is

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,639
not minimized in the system as a whole

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
because whenever we build a privacy

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
preserving system data still exists it

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
may exist only in the user device it may

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
exist encrypted to the server where only

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
the client has the key or where we

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
encrypt it with some

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
advanced cryptography so that we can

178
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
make operations with it we can

179
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
distribute it over multiple servers but

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
at the end of the day

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
data still exists so just talking about

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
minimizing data it's really not a good

183
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
metaphor to just explain to your

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319
engineers how they have to think to

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,479
actually fulfill this idea of privacy by

186
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,520
design

187
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
so we went back to the drawing board and

188
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
to think about more

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
what what is it that people that work in

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
academia and privacy

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
do when they design this wonderful

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
privacy preserving system

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
and we came to the realization that what

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,520
we actually do is to minimize the

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
privacy risks and we do that by

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
minimizing the trust assumptions on

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,960
others

198
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
in many places trust is considered a

199
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,039
good thing in the sense that you know if

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
i can trust you that's good but from a

201
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,199
privacy perspective the least i need to

202
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
trust you the more sure i am that you're

203
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
not going to violate my privacy

204
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
and kind of the key here is this on

205
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
other entities and this is what kind of

206
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
differentiates a little bit the the the

207
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
kind of things

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,960
that uh privacy engineers do more here

209
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
on divide on the privacy enhancing

210
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,919
technology side from maybe euros like in

211
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
the sense of who are we trying to

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,840
protect

213
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
from in general we're used to this kind

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
of third-party privacy that's what we

215
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,319
have in social networks where we trust

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,440
um

217
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
when we trust the provider but then we

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
don't trust other users or the third

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
parties and we have all this access

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,639
control right right now we're having

221
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
this uh there was this conversation

222
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
about zoom how we don't trust zoom but

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,479
well i mean we need to trust it and then

224
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,080
we trust that zoom is not gonna

225
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
broadcast everything we said to others

226
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,720
and because we may don't trust very much

227
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
so came the regulatory approaches to try

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
to put some

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
pressure on the provider from the legal

230
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
side they would have fines if they end

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
up leaking something and things like

232
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,479
this but actually from a privacy

233
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
perspective we would like to live here

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
the place in which we don't trust anyone

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
and now the question is how we do this

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,639
thing how we

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,000
how we move this trust we also

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
discovered that when we just say this

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,400
thing to people it doesn't really uh

240
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,319
doesn't really hit

241
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,919
the way in which they think like they

242
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,919
are still kind of a bit lost engineers

243
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,960
about how to how to reason about this

244
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
so um

245
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
what we with we discovered is that

246
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,958
actually what we do

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,320
as as private engineers is a lot

248
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,719
uh about another actually regulatory

249
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
principle the principle of purpose

250
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
limitation so when i write here the

251
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
usual approach is that the kind of

252
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
approach that we we have to build the

253
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,680
system and we mean like

254
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
the uh

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
broad computer science community

256
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
and you can see this already if many of

257
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
you are actually professors of computer

258
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
science or of similar discipline at the

259
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,959
university where you teach your students

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,800
the first times they program right when

261
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
they think about the program they think

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
okay i'm going to collect everything

263
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
everything i have

264
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
and then i'll do operations with

265
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
and that's also how people want to build

266
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,080
systems normally think about something

267
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
okay let's just collect all of the

268
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
things that are possible we don't care

269
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
and then it turns out it comes data

270
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
protection and you know the tribulation

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
minimization principle and you know

272
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
you cannot collect everything you want

273
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
because it has to be kind of associated

274
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
with your purpose so you end up

275
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
collecting leslie and that's most of the

276
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
systems that we have actually anything

277
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
that passes through the data protection

278
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,839
fund

279
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,440
but the privacy engineers think in a

280
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
very different way what we think is

281
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
about first what is the purpose of the

282
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,640
application

283
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
then we think exactly about what is the

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
data that i need for the purpose

285
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,519
and then um because there are other

286
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
operational purposes like you cannot

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
build systems without you know linking

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,320
things together and

289
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
creating servers and maybe there are

290
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,079
other legal requirements for

291
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
accountability and things like that and

292
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
you end up needing to to collect other

293
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
things the social security by the way we

294
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,839
need to fulfill so sometimes you may

295
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
need to collect a bit more data than

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,079
what is needed for the purpose you so

297
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,959
you will collect a bit more and to avoid

298
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,120
that the data that you

299
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
have to collect more for this

300
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
operational core process is where we put

301
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
privacy enhancing technologies to ensure

302
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,079
that the purpose is still fulfilled and

303
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,839
as one example

304
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
uh back in the two tens we built this

305
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,640
private csg drive uh scheme

306
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
in which we thought like if you have to

307
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
pay for how much you drive what is the

308
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
exact data that you need

309
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,959
and actually the only data that you need

310
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
to pay is to know the final amount of

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
the bill

312
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
the rest of the things that appear on a

313
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
bill are in general actually kind of

314
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,440
accountability and checks but it's not

315
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
the information that you need

316
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
and then that would be kind of the

317
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,519
minimal amount and to really build the

318
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,200
system and ensure that people could not

319
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
cheat and all of those things we

320
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
actually had to create a log the lock

321
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,399
had to be privacy preserving so we had

322
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,360
to encrypt it and that's how we ended up

323
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
with a system that had a bit more data

324
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
than the amount to build but it's still

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,680
much less data than any system that you

326
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
could collect that would actually gather

327
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,320
all of the gps data for the vehicles and

328
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
then maybe reduce it somewhere but it

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,959
could always be less than

330
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
so in this sense the idea of

331
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
limited purpose from a technological

332
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,800
perspective

333
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,399
limits actually the need of trust

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
because if all the data i give you

335
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
you cannot use it for anything else than

336
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
exactly the purpose i said to you i

337
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,480
don't need to trust you for that you're

338
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
not going to misuse it it's just going

339
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,000
to happen so this is kind of a good

340
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
metaphor to explain to people how to

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,639
think about privacy services

342
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,160
and that made me very happy right

343
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
because now i have a way to teach my

344
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,560
students about how to think uh in this

345
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
complex way that took me like

346
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
almost 20 years now of being working on

347
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,079
this topic to really understand uh what

348
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
is it that am i doing

349
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,639
and this is great we have now something

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,480
we have a tool to reason about these

351
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
systems and this is actually what you

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,079
see in

353
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,320
most of the academic literature but

354
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
people at the end of the day the

355
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
introduction of the paper says this is

356
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
the problem i have this is the only data

357
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
i need and then they spend all of the

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
rest of the section putting a lot of

359
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
technical details to just convince you

360
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
that they actually have fulfilled their

361
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,639
purpose with very little amount of data

362
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
by means of super cool crypto and other

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,399
stuff

364
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
and this actually

365
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
is very similar to to what would be a

366
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
waterfall software development where you

367
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
establish the requirements and then you

368
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,639
design the system to develop verify it

369
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
deploy it and maintain and you can read

370
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
these as you know

371
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,320
intro of the paper section one

372
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,519
um

373
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
system model

374
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
uh implementation of the system like an

375
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,560
instantiation evaluation and well we

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,839
don't deployment

377
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
but but you see how this goes but it

378
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,720
turns out that in the world we live

379
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
today this is called the past

380
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,760
nobody anymore actually uses this kind

381
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
of a waterfall right we now live in an

382
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
ideal world in which this idea that the

383
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
requirement phase happens at the very

384
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
beginning and then you just you know

385
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
waterfall design and deploy does not

386
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,160
happen sign is agile the requirements

387
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
change over time

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
and also we don't live in in a in a

389
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,200
system that where we control everything

390
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,519
as we do on the papers where we just

391
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
control the full stack you know i think

392
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
we now people deploy in this thing as a

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,279
service deploys over services in which

394
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
your design is not only constrained uh

395
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
with what you know what you can do and

396
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
your requirements but it's also

397
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,079
constrained by with these little blocks

398
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,680
that you're going to use as a service

399
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
whatever is an app

400
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
it is a service an authentication

401
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
service it is um

402
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,680
the cloud that is going to give you an

403
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
api and you are constrained by all of

404
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
those and those also affect your privacy

405
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
capabilities because if the api does not

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
offer what you want i mean you may want

407
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,320
to have

408
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
excellent crypto but if the api does not

409
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
offer it

410
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
it doesn't matter that you know all

411
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
about privacy preserving protocols you

412
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
just cannot build it and underline all

413
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,839
of these here infrastructure as a

414
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
service there is actually hardware it is

415
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
actually the chip

416
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
that uh infrastructure builds on that

417
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
the platform builds on software builds

418
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,959
on and that also constrains what each of

419
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
these elements can do

420
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,480
and just to show a little bit um how the

421
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
difference between having the freedom

422
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,279
like to be here as a privacy engineer or

423
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,120
not having so much freedom let me talk

424
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
about two projects that my lab developed

425
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
in the last two years uh on the left we

426
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
have a data share this is a

427
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
decentralized search engine

428
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,160
for investigative journalists we had a

429
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
two-year collaboration with the

430
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
international consumption of

431
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
investigative journalists the guys of

432
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,199
the luxembourg leagues the guys of the

433
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,720
panama papers

434
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,639
and they came to us and they say we have

435
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,120
a ton of electronic documents and we

436
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
would like to be able to search on each

437
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,160
other's collection because we find it

438
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,000
very useful but we're very scared of

439
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,680
putting them out there because they

440
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
actually can get us killed right these

441
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,959
guys have all of these leaks like

442
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
imagine snowden had just gone with the

443
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
pile of documents and just put it it on

444
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
the search engine for everybody to look

445
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
uh for things

446
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,519
for

447
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,600
uh before he left right

448
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
and and we built for them a system that

449
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
is uh currently being implemented

450
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,600
hopefully deployed by early next year

451
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
uh covet pandemic always the latest

452
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
things

453
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
and here what we had it was a complete

454
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
blank slate for design right this guy

455
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,839
said you can build anything we don't

456
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,360
have an infrastructure we don't have

457
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
anything so just you guys which are the

458
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
the privacy expert that what would you

459
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
do and in the sense we had a total

460
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,639
control of this tag i hear for total

461
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
quote unquote because we still have to

462
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,040
use the internet which is not something

463
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,600
that we can completely redesign

464
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
from scratch and also the journalists

465
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,079
don't have their own clouds and their

466
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
own things they still use

467
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
amazon web services so there are some

468
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
things that we will limit

469
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,959
but because we have this total control

470
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
and freedom we had space to deploy any

471
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,399
crypto we wanted and in fact we deployed

472
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,680
very novel protocols for them and

473
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
a new way of combining privacy

474
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
preserving protocols to solving their

475
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,120
problems

476
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
like because we also had a space to

477
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
design a whole system had a space to put

478
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
anonymous communications their anonymous

479
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,360
authentication all of it was great

480
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,519
on the other side like for the last year

481
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,680
and a half by spending this frantic

482
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
design of context raising up

483
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
and here we had to design very fast and

484
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
we had to design for something people

485
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,360
already had on their pockets

486
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
and that meant that our design was based

487
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
on existing components right an existing

488
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
on the phone the operative system had to

489
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,880
be existing on uh

490
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
on existing communications so we had to

491
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,599
use ble it tessa that ble has a payload

492
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,679
of 16 bytes well off you go like all

493
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,679
your crypto is actually limited to

494
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
having 16 bytes of payload believe me

495
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
that limits a lot of the kind of fancy

496
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
things we can do and the level of

497
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
security we can get we had to rely on

498
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,359
the services that the mobile and the

499
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,359
cloud gave us at the moment that google

500
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,959
and apple decided we're gonna implement

501
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,039
the protocol insight and give you an api

502
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,120
that's completely limited like there was

503
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
little space for our own crypto we

504
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
designed the protocol they took it they

505
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,440
put it down and that's the limit of our

506
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,840
of our power and also meant that the

507
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,919
end-to-end design space was completely

508
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
limited with what they said because if

509
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
this api gets a signature and the

510
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
signature is in the format that they

511
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
want you cannot now go fancy and use

512
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
group signatures or anonymous signatures

513
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,919
you have to use whatever they tell you

514
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,080
right and all of these things actually

515
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
completely change so this is to say that

516
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,039
whatever you put at the end of the day

517
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
and the lowest level in the hard work is

518
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,000
going to have an implication on what how

519
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,640
and how much we can build at the top

520
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
so with this

521
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
i'm started my

522
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,960
wish list

523
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
of things that would be great to have

524
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,440
and it would be great to start having

525
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
hardware that supports it because that

526
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
will also push

527
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
up up the stack like in the platform as

528
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
a service in the absence service more

529
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,760
and more libraries and capabilities to

530
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
use the things that we want to use as

531
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,520
privacy engineers and the first thing um

532
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
is well i really would like to have a

533
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,559
hardware crypto swiss knife that is

534
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,720
actually tailored to the needs of

535
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,840
privacy preserving protocols

536
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
and let me present you a couple of

537
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
cryptographic tools that we that we use

538
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
very much to use privacy preserving

539
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
systems and because i'm not a

540
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,440
photographer i'm not going to embarrass

541
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,880
myself going in the details of the

542
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
crypto and but i'm not just going to

543
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,120
give you pointers to what are the names

544
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
of these technologies which are these

545
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
key key keywords that if you're

546
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
interested in building technologies for

547
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,000
this you can go

548
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,840
and and google and find it in in

549
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,559
different uh

550
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,919
general

551
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,080
neural security conference or privacy

552
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
conferences and then you will find the

553
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
details of the crypto and i trust you

554
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,880
guys that you are the best that's

555
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,360
actually taking any crypto and put it

556
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
on a hardware implementation

557
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
so the first one i want to talk about is

558
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
private intersection which allows us to

559
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
to actually learn about the intersection

560
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,039
of two sets

561
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
without learning about anything else

562
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,280
that is not in the intersection we can

563
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
even go further and just learn some the

564
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,799
cardinality of the intersection even

565
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,240
without knowing what are the elements in

566
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
the intersection let alone elements that

567
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
are not in the intersection

568
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
and this has a lot of applications for

569
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
private content discovery like for

570
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
instance whatsapp contacts like who are

571
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
my contacts and what are the numbers uh

572
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
in the big database of whatsapp private

573
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
search this is actually what is

574
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,760
underlined apple see some very

575
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
controversial detection happy to talk

576
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
about it on the q a if you are

577
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,520
into that uh it is actually what is

578
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,760
behind our designing data share it can

579
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
be used for intrusion detection so the

580
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
two companies can compare an intrusion

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
logs without and unlearn

582
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
what are the common attacks within

583
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,760
knowing anything else about the rest of

584
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,559
the logs and has many more applications

585
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,679
and this kind of private set

586
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,440
intersections they are either based on

587
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
modulus pronunciation vcc which is a lot

588
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
of hashing

589
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
not necessarily

590
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
the the most common hashes that depends

591
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,480
on how exactly you want to build some of

592
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
them uh build a multi-party computation

593
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
uh mostly two-party computation because

594
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,840
in general these are thought about two

595
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,480
parties building an intersection

596
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
uh some of them are based on oblivious

597
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
pref which of course built on hashes and

598
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,760
cc but built in particular ways

599
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,559
and

600
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,799
because when we built these protocols we

601
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
not only think about about the hardcore

602
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
crypto but also that we need to put them

603
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,240
on a system and on a system we need to

604
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
make sure

605
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
that all of this is efficient and works

606
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,440
and a bunch of these things are not

607
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
efficient at all and because we don't

608
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
have a hardware acceleration or anything

609
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
they're just not efficient and we need

610
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,000
to use other tricks so one trick and

611
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
very common the private sector

612
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
intersection protocols is the use of

613
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,880
cuckoo filters which are the um clever

614
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
brother of the bloom filters if you want

615
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
to see them like that and we use those

616
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,799
for efficiency communication and speed

617
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,919
um

618
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,640
now maybe uh if

619
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,919
we're going to have more acceleration

620
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
hardware we don't need the trick anymore

621
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
but maybe you do so actually the input

622
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,360
to the protocol

623
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
at the hardware level is not going to be

624
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
messages as you think it's actually come

625
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,600
in a different format

626
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,679
and also um we do these operations but

627
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,919
running the whole protocol uh it doesn't

628
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
require one exponentiation it requires

629
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,720
one per element in the data set so we

630
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
need to run this

631
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,520
little

632
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
primitives here but we need to run them

633
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
many many many many times in order for

634
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,679
this uh to actually

635
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,039
and these are the kind of things that

636
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,000
when we just think about uh

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
the primitives we may think about okay

638
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
i'm gonna make this faster but sometimes

639
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,960
it's not only about making them faster

640
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
it's also about thinking what is going

641
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
to come surrounding and kind of code

642
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,720
assign those in a way that the whole

643
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,960
protocol is actually efficient and fast

644
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
which is actually what we need to be

645
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
able to put them in our systems

646
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
then we also have private information

647
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,480
retrieval which allows us to retrieve an

648
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
element from a database without telling

649
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
the database which element we retrieve

650
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
and this can be used for private

651
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
messaging so that you can retrieve

652
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
messages from

653
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
from a mailbox without telling

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,799
the

655
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,559
the mailbox which message you're

656
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
interested on or certificate

657
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
transparency so that you can retrieve

658
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
which certificates you want to check

659
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
without telling database of certificates

660
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
which thing you're browsing for private

661
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,640
media browsing for many of these things

662
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,039
and there are two flavors of private

663
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
information retrieval computational

664
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
which is actually securities based on

665
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
computational assumptions or information

666
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
theoretical which is about distributed

667
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
sets and

668
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
distributing the data on several servers

669
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,039
and then do some operations information

670
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
theoretically it's more secure it's just

671
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
information theoretically secure but you

672
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,320
know what um

673
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
i love all of these multi-party

674
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
computation things but when you want to

675
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
deploy in reality there are so very few

676
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
moments where you actually do have

677
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
uh non-colluding servers i'm sorry guys

678
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
i'm sorry to break this to you but in

679
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
practice this disappears really happens

680
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
uh for instance in the project with the

681
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
journalist right where people were like

682
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
oh why don't you do super fancy npc like

683
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,159
because these guys don't have two

684
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,080
servers like when we

685
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
talk about this possibility they said oh

686
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,880
yeah we can spin two instances on amazon

687
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
i was like ah it's not gonna cut it

688
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,600
right but you cannot expect that

689
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,440
different journalists in the world they

690
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
actually have one server one in each

691
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
jurisdiction right one in brazil one in

692
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,799
the uk

693
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
and i was going to say one in canada

694
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,559
it's kind of the same

695
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,640
one in china they don't have that they

696
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
only have one instance in amazon web

697
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,039
service so when you go for

698
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,279
deploying these things you mostly go for

699
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
the kind of one server thing even though

700
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,039
there's a lot of literature on the rest

701
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,080
but you know

702
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,679
that is the one that actually can hit

703
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,880
reality

704
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
and protocols of this sense are based

705
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,559
mainly on morphic encryption there's

706
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
some fancy that use something else and

707
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
that means that we mostly need lattice

708
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,000
that's right that's how morphic

709
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,039
decryption is built nowadays and um it's

710
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,320
better very little support for uh

711
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
lattices on hardware

712
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,559
and again here to make all of this

713
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,760
efficient uh we see how people use again

714
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,840
a lot of strategies to a lot of

715
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
strategies to represent data in a

716
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
different way like spacking and batching

717
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
so that they can compute

718
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
many things at the same time because it

719
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
will require

720
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,559
many operations on the server side

721
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,559
remember that you don't want to tell the

722
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,440
server what message you have touched and

723
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,799
this already gives you an idea that

724
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
you're going to have to touch a bunch of

725
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
them

726
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,360
if you really don't want to reveal which

727
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,279
one is the one of your interest

728
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,480
so you're going to have to do many

729
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
operations and these operations are

730
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
expensive so either due to this packing

731
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,559
invention or people nowadays are moving

732
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,720
to offline phases of pre-processing um

733
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
and this is actually also very

734
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
interesting right because you tell us

735
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,840
that that we have in many privacy

736
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
perspective protocols kind of two phases

737
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
one phase where maybe we don't care if

738
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,159
it's so energy efficient or so slow

739
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,240
because it's gonna be offline right so

740
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,799
we can actually spend uh maybe

741
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
more time doing it maybe we want to be

742
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,039
very energy efficient but we don't mind

743
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
if it is for one day you have to go

744
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,320
pre-processing all of these things

745
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,480
because it's a one-time cost but then

746
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
you need something very fast online and

747
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
this kind of two separate things may

748
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,159
actually result on very different

749
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,480
hardware designs but both of them are

750
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
going to help when combined to actually

751
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
uh allows us to use this kind of

752
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
primitives

753
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
very well in the wild

754
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,279
another one that we use a lot a lot

755
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,840
a lot is attributes based potential

756
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,279
because it allows us to do anonymous

757
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,640
authentication

758
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,559
look we can build end-to-end privacy

759
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,159
preserving systems without having a way

760
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,240
to authenticate without having a way of

761
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
actually preventing

762
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,039
and malicious users from uh coming into

763
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,159
the system

764
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
and a way of doing this is using this

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
kind of technology that is mainly based

766
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,480
on zero knowledge proofs and

767
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,320
green signatures sometimes it's an or

768
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
sometimes we can get away with just

769
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
doing the blind signatures and this

770
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,400
allows to prove in zero knowledge that

771
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,279
you're actually an authorized member

772
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,679
and to do these proofs we need to do a

773
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,240
lot of operations again by the moderate

774
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
explanations of the curves we're going

775
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
to use a lot of hash functions and

776
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
recently with a ton of bilinear pairings

777
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,679
by

778
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,320
are starting to be the kind of of the

779
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
core of most privacy preserving

780
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
protocols they have very nice properties

781
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
that allow them to be very flexible and

782
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,400
we can construct a very nice kind of

783
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,840
proofs with them

784
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,919
ah but they are also very expensive and

785
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
very hard to program and it would be

786
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
great to have an extractions and when we

787
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
have attributes with credentials kind of

788
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,000
the very basic is to just prove one

789
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,080
attribute i'm a member of this thing i'm

790
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
older than 18.

791
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
but actually there are very fancy

792
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
protocols that achieve

793
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,520
cooler things like the capability to

794
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,279
revoke

795
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,559
again you think about building

796
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,240
end-to-end systems and deploying them in

797
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
reality revocation is a must

798
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,600
um

799
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
limited usage so i'm going to give you

800
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,039
an anonymous credential that you can

801
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,679
only use one time or two times and again

802
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,440
each of these things kind of come with a

803
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,159
little bit more crypto and each step is

804
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
great it allows more functionality but

805
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,200
also makes them more prohibitive

806
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,799
and here we have something that as

807
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
opposed to before we don't require many

808
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,840
operations

809
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
only one operation on the client you

810
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,679
construct the proof only one operation

811
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,799
on the server to verify the proof but

812
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,039
both of these are expensive depending on

813
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,480
the anonymous credential and the serial

814
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
knowledge proof it may be that you put

815
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,080
more weight on the client on the server

816
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000
or you distribute but at the end of the

817
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
day one of them is going to be expensive

818
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,159
and therefore this kind of technology is

819
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
kind of hard many times to put out there

820
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,320
especially if we are going to put them

821
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
in smart cards that really don't have

822
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
much but

823
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
and there are many more of these of this

824
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
crypto that we use i just gave some

825
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,360
examples of the ones that are

826
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
very much used and that if you see

827
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,760
systems kind of all of them peak that's

828
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,320
many of these but all of the other all

829
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
of the other fancy protocols at the end

830
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,679
of the day the underlying building

831
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
blocks like the primitives you saw that

832
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
in my three examples i've studied

833
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,159
studied i already started to repeat what

834
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,640
are the needs are mostly common at the

835
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,559
end of the day all of them have the same

836
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,880
structure but the same primitives they

837
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
are used in slightly different ways it

838
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,520
is not that we have infinite of them

839
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
and that also means that the bottlenecks

840
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
are common and if you want to know more

841
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
about how this is used uh go to the

842
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,159
procedures of pets usenix ccs uh smp and

843
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,600
i encourage you to not to look at the

844
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
crypto papers there but actually look at

845
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,640
the privacy preserving systems in those

846
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
in those

847
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,240
papers and see how they use these

848
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,840
protocols how they combine them to

849
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,039
really understand the needs beyond

850
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,600
the crypto itself

851
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
so okay we have to these things so why

852
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,679
there is no privacy right they have said

853
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,600
before it's because it is very hard to

854
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,399
deport them in privacy they are based

855
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,120
typically in non-standard

856
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
use of cryptographic primitives

857
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,679
like i have mentioned is not that that

858
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
other people don't use ecc's the other

859
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
people or other schemes that use

860
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,679
moderate pronunciation but this is an

861
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
understanded use and therefore we cannot

862
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
use the implementation that out there so

863
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,559
they end up uh uh

864
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,159
you know there are mainly academic

865
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
primitives that nobody really works on

866
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
in the real world so there are very few

867
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
software libraries and the ones that

868
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
exist they need to build from scratch

869
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,799
because there is no hardware support

870
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,320
there is nothing underlying them they

871
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
have to implement all of the little

872
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
things and there but being a slow and

873
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
also

874
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
this library is sadly enough they have

875
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
subordinate support because they are

876
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,880
they are not built really by by

877
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
companies they are mostly built by

878
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,240
academia

879
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,960
and either they are very slow

880
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
because there is no hardware

881
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
acceleration we need to do everything in

882
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
software and these operations are very

883
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,279
very expensive because hardware

884
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,279
acceleration um

885
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,440
mainly focus on the mainstream

886
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
as rsa

887
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,559
also ecc but on these particular use

888
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
cases that i'm sorry it's not what we

889
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,399
need it's not how we use those

890
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,320
primitives and actually if you look in

891
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,440
the literature having people actually uh

892
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
read

893
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,320
uh kind of misusing sometimes these apis

894
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
so you can actually take

895
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,200
an rsa accelerator and misuse it

896
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,159
quote-unquote the api to actually build

897
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,320
a fast anonymous anonymous

898
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
authentication

899
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
but you know we wouldn't like to have to

900
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
go and reverse engineer how these things

901
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
work and find a way of misusing the apis

902
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,000
it could be great if we have apis that

903
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
actually allow us to build privacy

904
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,039
preserving systems

905
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,799
and many of these primitives are also

906
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,880
very energy consuming and there is no

907
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,240
efficient implementation because there

908
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
is no way we can do this uh only

909
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
software and that means that they become

910
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,320
absolutely prohibitive to do uh to put

911
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,240
anywhere that you actually don't have a

912
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,720
a power cord on it like the internet of

913
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
things

914
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
so what can you do for us one what would

915
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,919
be great

916
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,159
uh build hardware support

917
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,360
right build accelerators for for this

918
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,080
kind of uses uh of primitives for the

919
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
primitives that so far don't exist like

920
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,240
the linear pairings would be great right

921
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
if we could have some of those

922
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,519
and when you think about building this

923
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,240
hardware think both about putting it on

924
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
the normal processors that we have in

925
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
commodity devices because we want to

926
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,799
build these things

927
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,960
on the phone and on the laptop but also

928
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,240
think about how can we put it in

929
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
independent devices because as i said

930
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
very early in the talk right one of the

931
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,720
things that um

932
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
we don't want

933
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
where we want privacy is to about avoid

934
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
the power power that others can accept

935
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,760
and would you only put all of these

936
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,600
primitives on the mainstream uh devices

937
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
it actually means that privacy engineers

938
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
is still

939
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
under the control of the operative

940
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
service provider and this is the example

941
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,559
of the contact tracing apps

942
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,399
right even if you put there at the end

943
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,679
of the day they are going to be the one

944
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,720
that showed the

945
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
api to us and we're still going to be

946
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,840
limited so it's great if we can start to

947
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,360
separate and build independent devices

948
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
that allow us to actually escape from

949
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,960
the control of the googles and the

950
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,399
apples and the microsofts of the world

951
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,600
and then

952
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,880
let's build some energy efficient

953
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,120
implementations so that we can put this

954
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,960
even for phones right as you will know

955
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
everybody hates when the battery is

956
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
trained uh

957
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
very fast and some of them we're going

958
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,840
to need them fast because some of the

959
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
protocols we do

960
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,360
actually are for real kind of real-time

961
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,039
implementations or rather have speed

962
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,039
constraints again concentration up is an

963
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,480
example

964
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,960
some of them we want them small and very

965
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,399
efficient

966
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,960
for this iot of online phases or we just

967
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
want them to be

968
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
to be not consuming very much battery

969
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,919
but we don't really care about speed

970
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,000
like when we built this thing for the

971
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,519
for the journalists

972
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,320
uh

973
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
as opposed to other uh

974
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,559
psi protocols like the main thing for

975
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
contact discovery for instance what's up

976
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
is how fast you can go through this huge

977
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,360
list on the server of contacts

978
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,519
the journalists done this fast right

979
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,360
they want something to search and you

980
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,519
know waiting for one day to be able to

981
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,519
search on all of the journalists

982
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,200
collections of the world

983
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,159
that

984
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,799
if you don't wait you just can't get

985
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,360
zero capability to do that it's

986
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,760
perfectly fine for many privacy

987
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,480
preserving applications speed is not

988
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,399
actually a constraint

989
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
and it's again i think a a way of going

990
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,000
back and thinking about what is the

991
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
purpose of my application and what are

992
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,119
the

993
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
and what are the requirements because

994
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,639
we're many times nowadays very very um

995
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,679
very oriented by the goals of the

996
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,079
googles and the apples of the big tech

997
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,760
that tells us you know what are the

998
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
needs and they actually want to do real

999
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,079
time and and everything for them is kind

1000
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,520
of large scale

1001
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,280
but many people that actually need

1002
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,440
privacy at a much smaller scale and they

1003
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
are not always in a hurry so actually

1004
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
building for different trade-offs can be

1005
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
extremely useful when you talk with

1006
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,440
privacy engineers and for some we're not

1007
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
i'm here with my wish list we went both

1008
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,040
fast small and very efficient off you go

1009
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,359
and please please please when you you're

1010
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
going to do all of these things ensure

1011
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,399
that you talk with developers and sure

1012
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,520
that we talk with the people that are

1013
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,440
going to use it when deciding what kind

1014
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
of attraction you're going to offer the

1015
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
exterior how are we going to be able to

1016
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,359
use it because i'm sorry if we cannot

1017
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,440
program it does not exist right we

1018
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,000
cannot use it it's just useless but

1019
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
there are many people that are really

1020
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,800
looking forward to these technologies

1021
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,720
and we would love to spend a lot of time

1022
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
with you actually learning about your

1023
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,079
discipline and finding how to code

1024
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,320
assign to actually really bring these

1025
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,839
things to the market because that's the

1026
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,320
only way in which we can really have a

1027
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,440
privacy at the broad scope

1028
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,839
okay so do imagine that you gave me this

1029
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,200
thing and

1030
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
i now have my swiss knife of uh hardware

1031
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
crypto cool stuff

1032
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,800
are we done like no i'm sorry

1033
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,839
not done

1034
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,599
crypto is not the only thing encryption

1035
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,040
and confidentiality is not the same

1036
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,640
thing but now at least we can start to

1037
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720
build systems we're going to start have

1038
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,000
these primitives that allow me to

1039
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
compute it in the crypto domain and

1040
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
build systems with them and that means

1041
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,760
that we're going to use these primitives

1042
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,440
in different ways and we already talked

1043
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
a lot about batch operations

1044
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
and

1045
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
why this much operations happen let me

1046
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,960
remind you is because it is private so

1047
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,040
many times we either don't know which

1048
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
record we're interested in when we do

1049
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,560
something like in private settings

1050
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,240
section or we don't want to show which

1051
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,200
record we're interested in as in pir

1052
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,440
and that means that we need to repeat uh

1053
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,680
our operations many times that means

1054
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,119
that when you're thinking about hardwood

1055
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,280
about this maybe you just don't think

1056
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,520
about the entrance that only gets you uh

1057
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
one message maybe think about something

1058
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,440
that allows me to compute in batches

1059
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
that already gets that embedded into the

1060
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,359
hardware design that could actually

1061
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,400
allow to accelerate a lot uh the kind of

1062
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
things that we do and may actually

1063
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,760
if you do this kind of in in uh

1064
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,200
co-design with the people that do the

1065
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
protocols it may really really make the

1066
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
use of this primitive so much easier

1067
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
because we can abstract on some of the

1068
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,680
things that right now we actually need

1069
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,599
to program and so forth and it could be

1070
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,800
great if we could forget about

1071
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
but

1072
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,040
also we not only have these places we

1073
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
just need to compute on a full database

1074
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,960
a very much use a trick that we have on

1075
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
privacy preserver design is that we use

1076
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,480
a lot of trial decrypt

1077
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
and it is because the fact that it is

1078
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,480
private not only means that we don't

1079
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,560
know what message or what record we want

1080
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,920
to touch it also means that we don't

1081
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,359
know what key to use

1082
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,359
so we kind of need to try all of them

1083
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
and to give an example of this in

1084
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,839
concert tracing apps so first we have

1085
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,599
but we now have an extension that allows

1086
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,520
us to do what we call presence tracing

1087
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,920
and this is to kind of be able to

1088
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,079
um alert people that have been sharing

1089
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,480
in space like arrested at the bar a room

1090
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,800
a meeting and for this what we do is we

1091
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,640
put a qr code

1092
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
on the venue that these people are going

1093
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,640
to be in this qr code essentially

1094
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
contains a public key um

1095
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,040
it's a fancy privacy seven public key

1096
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
kind of thing but for all intents and

1097
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,440
purposes this talk is a public key and

1098
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,760
then when users come they scan they have

1099
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,839
the key with the

1100
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,599
phone of the cameras

1101
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,200
and then when eventually it is

1102
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,800
discovered that this restaurant had a

1103
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,040
positive and we want to launch an alarm

1104
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,440
to everyone and the doctors contact the

1105
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
restaurant give them an access code and

1106
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,760
then they can upload the secret key of

1107
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,400
this qr code to the server

1108
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,240
all phones

1109
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,200
go and collect all of these secret keys

1110
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
of all services

1111
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
and now they have a list of public keys

1112
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,760
they have scanned and a list of secret

1113
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,520
keys that some of them

1114
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,200
are uh

1115
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,599
that denote that

1116
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
there was an infection so now we need to

1117
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,040
go and try all of the keys in all of our

1118
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,680
uh public key scans to see if one of

1119
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
them actually decrypts if you decrypt

1120
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,000
you actually have been there but the

1121
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,640
only way we have is to actually try this

1122
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,400
right so that means that we not only

1123
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
batch cipher this we also batch keys and

1124
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,079
believe me this is a thing that we have

1125
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,160
to do many times when we design and we

1126
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
get to this quadratic explosion that

1127
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,680
actually again

1128
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,280
uh bombs our energy efficiency works our

1129
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,480
fastest

1130
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,200
time in this case for the phone right

1131
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,040
mostly we're carrying about energy

1132
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,320
efficiency

1133
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,520
uh the fact that we don't drain the

1134
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,359
battery of the phone and this is kind of

1135
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,680
problematic so if you can find us

1136
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
another way of building hardware that

1137
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,880
actually also thinks about the moment

1138
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,040
where we're going to receive many keys

1139
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,119
and be cool the good news is that the

1140
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,720
restraint the constraints here are also

1141
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,800
kind of a little more flexible it can be

1142
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,160
probabilistic

1143
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,760
this this uh

1144
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,079
decryption failure right you can you can

1145
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,320
and early if you're kind of almost very

1146
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
sure that this is not going to happen

1147
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
uh that means you can abort early to be

1148
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
fair we are not really sure but the

1149
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,640
timing attacks uh how much they would

1150
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,839
affect here

1151
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,440
but i've heard that the people in the

1152
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,040
chess community are actually experts on

1153
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
timing attacks so i hope that

1154
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,160
um and you guys can work a little bit on

1155
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
it and and give us like what is the good

1156
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,640
trade of here for the risk they have in

1157
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,880
the drivers and the timing attack but

1158
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
the advantages that it gives me on

1159
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,800
implementation side

1160
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,480
we could also use some plain text

1161
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
that depends on on the privacy situation

1162
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,319
you can have a trade-off but we could

1163
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,160
also imagine situations in which we can

1164
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
give some hints so that you don't need

1165
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,119
to test all the keys on all the cycles

1166
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,040
we can talk about all of those things

1167
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,400
but at the end of the day we're still

1168
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
going to do trial decrypt where we're

1169
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,599
still going to need to repeat this

1170
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,760
operation gazillion times with different

1171
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,839
keys

1172
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,079
so that's another thing we use a lot and

1173
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,920
another main difference that they think

1174
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,079
that sometimes is uh

1175
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,760
is it's not really seen about how

1176
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,200
different it is when you design the

1177
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
hardware and when you design the whole

1178
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,079
system in particular from a privacy

1179
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,280
certain way

1180
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,319
is that

1181
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,160
a chairs like most of the things are

1182
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
really uh on this chip like the

1183
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,880
adversary is looking here very close to

1184
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,359
the chip and can't can talk to it but

1185
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,680
when we design a privacy persuasion

1186
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,040
system like chips or part of devices and

1187
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
we actually assume that the adversary is

1188
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
kind of everywhere right against liquid

1189
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
devices you can also look at the chip

1190
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
it's not that we forget about this thing

1191
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,319
it can look at the cloud it can look

1192
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,560
essentially you can look

1193
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
and what that means is that maybe the

1194
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,560
adversary cannot do the attack here and

1195
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,200
you they think well that was my job

1196
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,480
but

1197
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
uh diversity may do the attack here

1198
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
right and

1199
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,359
and that means that what i said before

1200
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,599
like encryption is only the first step

1201
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,560
to achieve privacy and you're not done

1202
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
we are not done when we encrypt things

1203
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,359
and this starts to be very very relevant

1204
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,200
in the world of the internet of things

1205
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
and here is a paper from from my

1206
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,760
colleagues at epfl where they started

1207
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,480
studying bluetooth wearable devices and

1208
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,640
particularly kind of fancy apple phones

1209
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,760
and

1210
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
things where you can install apps that

1211
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,720
interact with your phone and do a bunch

1212
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,400
of stuff and a lot of these apps are

1213
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
actually very sensitive because they

1214
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
have to go with health or they have to

1215
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,680
uh with a church like there are apps

1216
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
that remind you when to pray their apps

1217
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,280
forever

1218
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
um so

1219
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,720
what they show here right is that when

1220
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,960
you have that thing that adversary may

1221
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,200
not be actually on the phone may

1222
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,599
actually just be at the network looking

1223
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,440
at the cryptic communication

1224
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,680
and then like

1225
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
a good adversary will just look at this

1226
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
look how the packets look like and then

1227
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,160
it is able to identify sensitive actions

1228
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,400
and it is able to identify actions like

1229
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,880
to a very large extent here we have a

1230
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
application matrix this is where the

1231
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,119
vessel is predicted excuse the true

1232
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,400
label and we see that the adversary

1233
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,079
makes very good errors right the

1234
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,640
probability of having the predicted

1235
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
equal to the true is very high the rest

1236
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
is fundamentally white only when there

1237
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
are very low volume applications when

1238
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
there is not enough traffic that person

1239
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
is not able to do this distinction

1240
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,119
and the things that they show extremely

1241
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,960
practically invasive like yeah you can

1242
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,400
decide whether there is a measurement

1243
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,720
you can see for applications that are

1244
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,960
about when you eat whether there is food

1245
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,839
intake when you send messages receive

1246
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,119
messages and and i just took another

1247
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,880
example from there

1248
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,200
on the paper to show that you even like

1249
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,440
this is a an application

1250
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,160
to for diabetic people to actually kind

1251
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,200
of take notes of how they're doing

1252
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,800
and the application

1253
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
says everything right when you when

1254
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,280
you're eating food what kind of food

1255
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,599
you're eating how you're doing and then

1256
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,200
they say when you add glucose and with

1257
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,359
your insulin just kind of keep you on

1258
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,200
track and this guy showed that you can

1259
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
essentially distinguish everything

1260
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,359
everything that happened just by the

1261
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,720
traffic

1262
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,800
and how we typically solve this from a

1263
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,319
privacy perspective perspective is to

1264
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,160
use dummy traffic that you may also have

1265
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,560
heard about as tough

1266
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,480
and the goal is to hide information from

1267
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,720
this network observer to hide these

1268
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,119
patterns because otherwise i'm sorry the

1269
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,720
internet of things is never going to be

1270
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
private because we're going to have

1271
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,040
we're going to be leaking a lot on what

1272
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,079
these things are sending uh the router

1273
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,359
to the phone

1274
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,520
to whomever they ascend

1275
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,440
and the signs that work on damage

1276
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,079
traffic they do one or more of things

1277
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,400
either they add packets at

1278
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,480
random intervals and

1279
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
how what is the distribution of this

1280
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,720
randomness actually matters a lot happy

1281
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,560
to have a whole discussion about how

1282
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,280
hard it is to get it right

1283
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,599
or you can add packets not kind of from

1284
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,119
a random distribution but actually to

1285
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,000
mimic other applications other actions

1286
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
right you just try to mimic you start to

1287
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,200
to to hide in the crowd

1288
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,720
and the thing about all of these is that

1289
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,119
it has high cost because you need to

1290
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,359
compute more things you need to compute

1291
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,960
when to put

1292
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
these things out you're going to consume

1293
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
bandwidth because you need to put and it

1294
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,720
can sound that bandwidth

1295
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,280
consumes energy

1296
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,359
you're also going to have to wake up at

1297
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,960
moments that typically you don't have to

1298
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
wake up so you're going to augment the

1299
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,599
number of times that the phone or the

1300
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,760
device the iot device has to spend

1301
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,079
battery it has to actually pull you know

1302
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,480
i can come on and take the big

1303
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,359
energy energy spike from the back and

1304
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,200
that means that the ndf will be deployed

1305
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,280
but as i said without them we're not

1306
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,480
going to have end-to-end privacy

1307
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,240
preserving systems

1308
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,440
so what can you do and and this may be

1309
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,359
one of my wildest dreams if these are

1310
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
possible can we reduce the energy

1311
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,000
consumption if you guys think about the

1312
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,160
fact that this is gonna happen the fact

1313
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,200
that

1314
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,480
there are gonna be more messages than

1315
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,760
what you think the fact that uh we're

1316
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
gonna have to combine network privacy

1317
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,920
with computation privacy when we do

1318
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
something that allows these devices to

1319
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,079
be more energy efficient

1320
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,000
can we maybe just create the damage at

1321
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,680
the hardware level

1322
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,200
they just need to be random i mean with

1323
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,720
some particular randomness but maybe we

1324
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,160
can configure that

1325
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,280
and also

1326
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,960
the timing their timing is kind of

1327
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,720
independent of real traffic i mean

1328
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
that's the whole point right if you make

1329
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,480
the time independent of the real traffic

1330
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
that means that also the damage traffic

1331
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
is going to leak information about the

1332
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,400
real one so maybe we can actually just

1333
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,640
create chips that do that for us

1334
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,560
and maybe those are much more efficient

1335
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,920
that actually the kind of things that we

1336
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,760
have nowadays we're going to do have to

1337
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,240
do with the application layer and then

1338
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
we have to

1339
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,079
well reduce a lot of things that are

1340
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,079
very non-efficient and again i would

1341
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,359
like to remind you that sometimes the

1342
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,280
speed is not a requirement we can't

1343
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
afford very slow efficient computation

1344
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,240
maybe

1345
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,200
over time we can sometimes even afford

1346
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
very slow transmission over the network

1347
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,520
because you know we're not in a hiring

1348
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,800
so maybe we can find ways in which um

1349
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,119
and actually the network interface is

1350
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,200
used by the hardware in a way that

1351
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,880
allows us to put more traffic on the

1352
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,599
line in a slower way but actually gets

1353
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,960
us to have a very high priority at a low

1354
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,880
cost so that you can actually convince

1355
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,040
vendors vendors of these um

1356
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,760
small devices or vendors or phones that

1357
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
actually we need to protect the traffic

1358
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,920
because otherwise we're lost

1359
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,599
and by now you're thinking well why does

1360
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,599
this person come to ask me for basic

1361
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,760
things that we cannot do

1362
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
the good thing is that negative results

1363
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,400
are also great okay if you cannot do if

1364
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,720
you tell me that there are limits on the

1365
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
harvard state that we are never going to

1366
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,839
get

1367
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,040
visit that shows the limit of privacy

1368
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,599
are as important as solutions we move

1369
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,520
forward in this digital world on the

1370
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,359
assumption that we will fix it later

1371
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,960
right you can see this with machine

1372
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,079
learning fairness or with

1373
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,160
optimization or in general with privacy

1374
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,000
right it will come later on we'll build

1375
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,359
it and then later on we'll plug

1376
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,400
something in

1377
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
it is very important to inform policy

1378
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,880
discussions about the snake oil that

1379
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
they are being sold when people tell

1380
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,960
them that this will be solved that we

1381
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,720
will solve the ethics of ai you just

1382
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,559
need to wait like for a couple of years

1383
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,400
until someone in eurips comes up with

1384
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,640
the algorithm no we start starting to

1385
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,960
have more and more uh negative results

1386
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,880
there that show that

1387
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,280
robustness cannot coexist with fairness

1388
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,960
or that privacy cannot coexist with

1389
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
robustness and these things are so

1390
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,119
important because otherwise policymakers

1391
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,800
that are you know love it all the time

1392
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,160
they will believe that the holy grail

1393
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,920
will appear and it will solve all of

1394
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,599
their problems and by the time they

1395
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,440
realize this is not the case we will

1396
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,280
have a world in which privacy is not

1397
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,359
possible anymore so you have negative

1398
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
results bring them to the table i would

1399
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,800
also be happy to take them on and to and

1400
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,359
to also write on our papers like well

1401
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,119
this is the limit of what we can do and

1402
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,559
now we have to choose in which kind of

1403
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,720
society we want to live a society which

1404
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,400
maybe has an application but we'll never

1405
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,319
have privacy or the society would you

1406
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,680
know maybe we're a little bit less

1407
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,920
digital but we do have privacy that's

1408
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,839
kind of

1409
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,319
nice so with this i would like to to end

1410
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,640
my talk and to

1411
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,960
just kind of reverse the key points

1412
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,040
what we do when we do privacy is to

1413
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,280
actually limit the purpose of systems

1414
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,359
that we create so that we don't need to

1415
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,160
trust anyone to use the data under

1416
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,880
purpose and for doing that we need to

1417
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,319
use a bunch of non-standard

1418
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,079
cryptographic and non-cryptographic

1419
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,240
solutions like the dummy traffic

1420
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,760
and these are constrained by the

1421
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,359
infrastructure and infrastructure

1422
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,839
includes hardware and sometimes help

1423
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,400
starts from the bottom and if you can

1424
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,920
kind of help from this bottom by

1425
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,839
producing more and more efficient things

1426
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,839
it will be easier that actually those

1427
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,680
improvements get to the software layer

1428
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,280
and we're actually able to deploy this

1429
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,599
thing so we need better support and if

1430
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,680
you cannot build it let's

1431
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,680
find the limits and this is equally

1432
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,480
important uh for the for the actual

1433
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,040
discussion at the broader level

1434
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,000
and with this i'd like to stop and take

1435
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,559
questions which i hope to have many and

1436
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,800
learn more from you than maybe what you

1437
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,960
have learned from me today thank you

1438
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,359
very much

1439
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,599
thank you so much carmilla was a great

1440
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,800
talk

1441
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,720
so we have so far one question in the

1442
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,240
zulub chat and i have a few more

1443
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,160
questions so one question is about um

1444
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,760
homomorphic encryption versus

1445
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,920
multi-party computation

1446
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,440
where the question says that the

1447
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,599
confidential computing consortium claims

1448
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,119
that there is an ambiguity in the

1449
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,880
definitions of homomorphic encryption

1450
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
and multi-party computation that leads

1451
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,040
to gray areas between the two concepts

1452
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,240
and the question is if you have any

1453
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,799
thoughts on this

1454
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,240
i think that that can be probably

1455
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,160
correct right then

1456
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,240
sometimes multi-party computations you

1457
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,640
could really call it homomorphic

1458
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,200
encryption in a way because you're doing

1459
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,640
uh

1460
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,160
you're doing like the kind of techniques

1461
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,400
you use they are so close to each other

1462
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,880
that that probably they are the same

1463
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,680
now

1464
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,599
uh from my perspective or maybe in the

1465
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,440
context of this talk this is even better

1466
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,200
news because it means you guys may only

1467
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,319
need to do

1468
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,960
one of these to actually you know

1469
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,559
two birds with one stone

1470
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,079
you can help us do multi-party

1471
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,599
computation and homomorphic encryption

1472
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,559
with the same piece of hardware uh

1473
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,359
it's much important

1474
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,800
thank you there's a another question

1475
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,040
to what extent does privacy require

1476
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,960
secure hardware or a secure system

1477
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,280
ultimately you don't have a security on

1478
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,559
a compromised system but perhaps

1479
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,240
state-of-the-art systems

1480
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,000
sufficiently minimize data stored on the

1481
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,480
user's device to for example survive

1482
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,000
later a temporary compromise

1483
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,319
that's a very good question uh no in

1484
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,319
many ways many many many cases i don't

1485
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,400
think we really need a

1486
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,160
secure hardware like anti-tampering

1487
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,880
hardware like the adversary model i said

1488
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,680
that

1489
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,520
in my in my picture about the two

1490
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,599
adversaries i said the privacy also

1491
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,200
cares about the tags that you can have

1492
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,599
on the chip it does it does in the sense

1493
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,480
that uh especially when we outsource to

1494
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,160
the cloud and we don't trust the cloud

1495
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,640
at all we also don't trust that the

1496
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,520
cloud

1497
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,280
just very powerful adversary like the

1498
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
cloud provider cannot maybe do a

1499
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,440
hardware attack there but as this person

1500
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,400
says uh maybe on the phone physical

1501
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,400
security is not uh it's not the

1502
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,160
the priority

1503
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,520
but again like the fact that the

1504
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,880
hardware is not secure doesn't mean that

1505
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,359
the hardware cannot help securing the

1506
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,800
network

1507
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
you see what i mean

1508
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,760
thank you um

1509
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
another question a hardware-based

1510
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,440
trusted execution environments are also

1511
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,480
emerging as a solution for

1512
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,640
privacy-preserving scenarios you did not

1513
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,800
talk about those did you imply that tes

1514
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,640
are not important or will not be

1515
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,800
dominant in the future

1516
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,800
ah

1517
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,319
crystal bowling is not my fourth day um

1518
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,760
so i think the teas are interesting uh

1519
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,839
they are very useful they sometimes

1520
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,160
enable to

1521
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,400
to even kind of

1522
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,720
offload some of the heavy computations

1523
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,319
of all of these protocols kind of the

1524
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,559
tea and you can make hybrid approaches

1525
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,200
so there are two things one is that yeti

1526
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,359
is maybe but you know not all phones

1527
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,960
have t's and in general these are also

1528
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,280
very restricted in access again as we

1529
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
were we were talking about that before

1530
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,160
right

1531
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,920
phones have tes nowadays do you know how

1532
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,440
many can i use to build my privacy

1533
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,640
serving applications zero so that is not

1534
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,200
going to be kind of of the solution that

1535
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,960
that brings privacy and privacy in

1536
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,119
europe i think the broader scale it kind

1537
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,040
of actually still leaves the privacy

1538
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,440
engineer in the hands of the powerful

1539
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,880
the google and the apples they're going

1540
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,160
to decide who why and when can use the

1541
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,680
teas

1542
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,319
um it also is still

1543
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,040
a kind of technology that depends on

1544
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,800
maybe the hardware manufacturers and how

1545
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,240
they do these things

1546
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,760
so i don't know i think that we need

1547
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,319
both both at the same time but in

1548
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,000
particular um

1549
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,680
yeah what i don't believe is that

1550
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
everybody's going to have access to

1551
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,960
a te

1552
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,680
and so we need other ways to get access

1553
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,920
to the privacy that the teu could give

1554
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,720
and this is actually

1555
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,200
okay

1556
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,920
i have one question actually which is

1557
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,680
so you're saying that privacy is about

1558
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,119
minimizing trust and i think as

1559
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,119
when looking at cryptographic protocols

1560
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,720
whenever we

1561
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,960
eliminate more trusted parties to

1562
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,359
ideally have none left at the end

1563
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,040
we get a problem with usability so

1564
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,200
usually systems where we trust some some

1565
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,520
parties are much easier to use

1566
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,599
like one trusted central party

1567
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,960
already simplifies a lot of

1568
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,359
authentication issues um key management

1569
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,520
and all of these things so how much do

1570
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,119
you think this is an issue

1571
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,880
that if we're building more and more

1572
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
privacy preserving and trust minimizing

1573
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,000
systems

1574
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,839
that the average user isn't using them

1575
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,920
anymore or can't be using them anymore

1576
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,240
okay i don't think

1577
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,559
that the usability uh when you were

1578
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,680
saying that i was thinking that you were

1579
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,040
thinking about the usability for the

1580
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,319
developer

1581
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,920
which indeed is a freaking nightmare

1582
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,599
right every time we decentralize we need

1583
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,400
to go around doing a lot of stuff

1584
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,640
and uh and it is hard it's hard to get

1585
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,040
it right but for the user it's not that

1586
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,799
these things uh

1587
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,880
really kind of make a big difference

1588
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,040
right now the question is can

1589
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,119
can can we abstract this away from the

1590
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,520
user like i don't understand why having

1591
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,359
a decentralized system essentially makes

1592
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,359
it different from the point of view

1593
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,319
of of the user uh for example in the

1594
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,359
contact racing apps users have no idea

1595
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,799
whether the thing is decentralized or

1596
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,160
not in fact they could not distinguish

1597
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,680
or decentralize from a centralized thing

1598
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,839
but because for them there is a phone

1599
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,280
doing bluetooth and sending stuff to

1600
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,640
places

1601
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,440
so i think you're very right that

1602
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,920
privacy preserving technologies make

1603
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,599
developers life much much harder i'm not

1604
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,240
so sure that that necessarily goes to

1605
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,720
making the user life so hard

1606
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,680
and

1607
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,640
also

1608
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,079
i mean thankfully enough there is a lot

1609
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,520
of research that goes actually on

1610
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
usability of privacy technologies and we

1611
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,440
probably would need we did more but i

1612
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,200
don't think that those things are kind

1613
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,640
of

1614
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,079
fundamentally impossible to put together

1615
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,839
okay

1616
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,559
that's great um

1617
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,160
one more question

1618
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,559
uh can you maybe elaborate a bit on when

1619
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,640
you meant uh when you mentioned in one

1620
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,119
of the slides you can't build end-to-end

1621
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,920
without authentication

1622
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,079
so we want to use this privacy

1623
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,760
preserving uh schemes uh

1624
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,040
and we have a lot of the for instance

1625
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,599
privacy preserving search right and

1626
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,839
privacy preserving search it's um

1627
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,680
at the end of the day a leaky primitive

1628
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,079
because you are going to leak one thing

1629
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,000
what you search for right if you search

1630
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,079
for something and you and you find it

1631
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,599
you can receive it

1632
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,880
now

1633
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,000
the only way we have to avoid that is to

1634
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,680
avoid that somebody can come and make

1635
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,280
infinite queries

1636
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,280
and for that we need to know that people

1637
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,599
that came uh but that the people cannot

1638
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,680
do infinite ones and the ways we have to

1639
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,760
solve those things are then to bring uh

1640
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,599
authentication now when we have

1641
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,160
authentication we're losing a lot of the

1642
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,319
privacy

1643
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,240
on the privacy problems we had before

1644
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,400
privacy properties we had before so we

1645
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,720
want to do anonymous identification that

1646
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,000
is one case uh in other cases for

1647
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,040
for uh abusive systems like many times

1648
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,040
people like wikipedia for instance would

1649
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,079
like to

1650
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,920
to be able to actually limit how much

1651
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,160
abuse there is and they do this by doing

1652
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,799
a straightforward authentication

1653
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,319
and if you move to the privacy

1654
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,839
preserving world then you would like to

1655
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:18,880
have some kind of anonymous

1656
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,640
authentication that allows you to say

1657
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,200
i'm a legitimate user right that is not

1658
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,960
doing bad things and that's the kind of

1659
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,559
things you need to prove

1660
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,119
but uh why we need all of those is

1661
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,280
because if we ask wikipedia to go

1662
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,359
anonymous then they ask us give us an

1663
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,480
abuse

1664
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,960
an abuse prevention system uh in the

1665
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,400
case of the search is the same kind of

1666
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,599
thing so maybe what i'm saying is that

1667
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,520
we need authentication for prevention

1668
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,040
and then we need

1669
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,920
to bring that again take a step back and

1670
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,760
put that prevention in the privacy for

1671
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,920
certain way i think that's what i meant

1672
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,960
i don't know if i make a better word

1673
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,400
i think you made it better

1674
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,640
um okay also i think we have two more

1675
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,480
