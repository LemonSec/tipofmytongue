[Music]

3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,199
we're live on youtube so you're ready to

4
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,279
go have a good session

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,720
excellent thank you you see my screen

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
time right you don't see my zoom window

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
on top of it correct

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
excellent good great

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
okay um welcome back everyone from this

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,920
short break for the next session which

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,359
is

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
the test of time awards ceremony at

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,680
chess 2021

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
and it's my pleasure to share the

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,840
session to host the

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,039
session this session obviously is about

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,680
the test of time award um this is

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
something we started quite recently

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
namely last year in

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
chess 2020

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
and the ideas um were the same as all

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,399
over icr we would like to kind of you

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,440
know

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
appreciate a paper that has a lasting

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
impact on the field

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,440
um both ideally in academia and an

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
industry

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,840
um

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,239
the models that we kind of the what we

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,399
selected is that um

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,079
we have a we have a sliding window of

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,520
three years

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,479
so

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,000
and when we

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
papers that were published at just

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
within those three years

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,840
are eligible to be

38
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,920
nominated and then from those papers

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
uh there's committee that makes a

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
selection okay so and so the window goes

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
back um

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
from 21 to 19 years

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
so

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
this year it's um just 2000 chess 2001

45
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
chess 2002 those papers are eligible

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
um anyone is able to nominate okay um

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
there's this yearly rotating

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,360
committee

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
that that makes the ultimate selection

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
this committee is formed by two members

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
who are appointed by the chestering

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
committee

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
and by three invited members

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
who ideally

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,240
are

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
you know program committee chairs from

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,520
those years of chess or

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
or members of the program committee or

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
something like this and we also strive

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
to have at least one member from

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
industry because as i said impact and

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,840
industry is also something that we would

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,399
like to assess somehow

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,759
you can see more

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
all the details about um

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
everything here on the on on this

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,520
webpage about the first kind of work

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,480
um

69
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,120
for this year the the committee was

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
composed of the following people there

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
was uh english verbal veda

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
jean sebastian caron who actually was a

73
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
pc member in 2001 and 2002 and

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
actually also received the award last

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
year

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,959
um

77
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
there was david nakash pc chair 2001 pc

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
member 2002 back sooner

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
who was a sub reviewer in 2001 and the

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
pc member 2002 and then myself so i

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
would like to thank

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
all the committee members

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
for their for their effort and for the

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,920
work and selecting the paper

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
okay and so ultimately um

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
we

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
answered the big question we have all

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
those two well it's a paper from chess

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
2001

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,640
it's written by luige

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
and the award is for his paper a sound

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040
method for switching between

93
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,040
boolean and arithmetic masking

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
congratulations to you louis

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,120
thank you

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
i will say a few more words

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
um

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
i just have to switch my screen quickly

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
tricky it doesn't work all right so um

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,959
a little bit of background the

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
as you just saw the paper is published

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
at just 2001. so think back to that

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
situation dpa was rather new

104
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
um it was i guess

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
rather a shock

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
well not only dpa but the whole power

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,879
analysis story was probably a shock for

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,280
the industry and people were looking for

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
counter measures some were quite ad hoc

110
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
um

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
and also remember you know people people

112
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
were still learning about dpa itself so

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
2001 that's three cpa era right it was

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
it was all single bit

115
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
or maybe multi-good dpa or something but

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
it was free cpa error okay so for most

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,720
of the phd students who are now

118
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
listening that's probably

119
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
hard to imagine how that was

120
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
anyhow so masking had just been recently

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
proposed as a new and sound method for

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
protecting cryptographic software

123
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,959
implementations

124
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
and it could quite easily be applied to

125
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,959
algorithms if it was possible to rewrite

126
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,478
the algorithms in such a way that they

127
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
work on masked inputs and produce mass

128
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
outputs and that worked well for some of

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
the algorithms but it didn't work for

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
all of the algorithms at that time

131
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,840
for example it didn't work for some of

132
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
the aes candidates

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
and again go back and remember this is

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
2001 so the competition had just

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
finished

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
um it didn't work for idea and it didn't

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,840
work for sha1

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
these algorithms mix

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
boolean and arithmetic

140
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
boolean and arithmetic operations

141
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
um so we need different kinds of

142
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
maskings and we also need methods to

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
yeah to convert back and forth between

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
them

145
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
there was a solution that was earlier

146
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
proposed by messages

147
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
and then was shown to be insufficient to

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
protect against epa

149
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
and um so louis went ahead and wrote

150
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,120
this paper

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
in which he proposes two new algorithms

152
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,039
convert back and forth

153
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
and these algorithms are provable secure

154
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
against dpa okay

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
and so if you compare this this

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,280
statement prove it secure against epa

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
you will see that you know um so two

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
questions today would be approvable in

159
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
which model

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,720
and proof against exactly which dpa but

161
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
i guess at the time

162
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
um dpa was always first ordered right

163
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
there was no

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
there was no strong drive towards higher

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,759
order things so things happy both

166
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
it turned out that boolean to arithmetic

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,639
conversion is quite easy and that

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,080
arithmetic to boolean conversion is

169
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
somewhat more involved i'm sure louie

170
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,638
will speak about that

171
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
and

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
so we selected this paper because uh not

173
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
because it has the highest citation

174
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
count it doesn't

175
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
uh from the papers that were nominated

176
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,720
um

177
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,319
but you we also took into account that

178
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
this is a very very niche topic this is

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
a very small niche topic within the

180
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
field of masking

181
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
it's a small niche

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,039
but

183
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
considering the small size of the niche

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
the citations are are high and and the

185
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,360
impact that the paper has high i'm going

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
to speak about it in a

187
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
moment um

188
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,880
the the paper today has around 180

189
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
citations on google scholar

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
um

191
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
and we see that the follow-up work yeah

192
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,120
is always about people trying to

193
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
find flaws in the existing algorithms

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
or or try to improve them

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
try to make them more efficient extend

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
them to higher orders and so on

197
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,759
and this is the line of work that has

198
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,560
been going on consistently over 20 years

199
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
so and today the paper finds a

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
completely new application field in the

201
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
masting of post-quantum algorithms um

202
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,319
you have seen

203
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,479
probably cited several times in the

204
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,919
in the first session on post quantum

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
crypto on monday

206
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
um so this clearly demonstrates the

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
long-term impact of the paper in

208
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
academia

209
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
um it's also a short paper which is

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
something i would like to highlight it's

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
a paper the

212
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
main body of the paper is nine pages

213
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,639
okay so a good paper doesn't have to be

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,880
long

215
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,319
it's hard to say something about the

216
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
impact of this paper and industry i hope

217
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
luis will speak about that a little bit

218
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
but um so at the time when this paper

219
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,479
was written louis was working for

220
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,080
schlumberger as far as i could figure

221
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
out which later became exalto and today

222
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
is gemalto

223
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,280
therefore i guess the motivation for the

224
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,440
work came from industry

225
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,479
i found

226
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
nine patents that cite this paper

227
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,160
six of them are by smart card companies

228
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
including

229
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
louie's first

230
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
okay and now i would like to give the

231
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,799
georgia luis let's check the screen

232
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,919
the floor is here

233
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,080
screen

234
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
is it okay for my screen

235
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,360
yes

236
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
okay if you go to presentation mode

237
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,560
we still see the slides bar on the left

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
you know then your presentation starts

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,120
i'm trying to do that

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,440
is it okay now

241
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
yes

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
okay

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
so first um

244
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,279
first i would like to thank the

245
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,839
test of time committee and

246
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,240
the chess

247
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,720
2021 organizer for this great honor i am

248
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
very

249
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
happy and proud of

250
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,079
having this old paper

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
nominated and accepted for this award

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,360
it's a bit strange to to think about a

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
20 year old paper but i

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
i think it's a good

255
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
it's a good idea to uh to remember this

256
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
paper and to see what are have the

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,480
what consequences it can have

258
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,279
on the current research

259
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
so this is a paper so as a benedict

260
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,279
mentioned

261
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
at this time i was working in

262
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
schlumberger cpa it was a former name

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
and it had many names later exalted

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
and

265
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,279
now it's even not gemalto it's tales

266
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,959
the latest name is palace

267
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,959
so

268
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
so yeah chess 2001 was in paris at this

269
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
time

270
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
and

271
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
as benedict summarized

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
all the story was about differential

273
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
power analysis so

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
benedict

275
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
mentioned the model in which we were and

276
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,880
so basically we were in a very uh

277
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
first model of dpa and

278
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,800
what we were

279
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
considering is the fact that each

280
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
intermediate variable during a

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,839
computation

282
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,200
uh could or not depend on

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
key beats

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
and so

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
it was the danger was

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
when the

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
intermediate variables were

288
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
depending on a few key bits not all the

289
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
key bits and that's what that's

290
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
what

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
made the attacks possible

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
and still make

293
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,600
them possible but there was

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
it was basically the model in which we

295
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
were and we tried

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
to uh

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
to avoid this

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
this problem

299
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,240
by changing the way of implementing the

300
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,120
the

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
algorithm so that

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
each intermediate variables did not

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,279
depend on

304
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
too few key bits

305
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
so several countermeasures existed of

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
course already at this time the you

307
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
remember that the first chess edition

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
was in 99

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
and we

310
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,839
proposed at this uh first edition of

311
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,959
chess

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,640
the duplication method with jacques

313
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,720
patera and there was also the crypto

314
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,040
99 paper by ib the ibm team

315
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
which proposed this

316
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
kind of similar uh

317
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
method to uh

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
to counteract power analysis attacks

319
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,600
and mess address tone messages

320
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,240
as benedict said

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
also proposed

322
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
specific

323
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,079
methods for the aes finalists so in fsc

324
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
2000

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
and

326
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
what happened is that

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
the method proposed by messages had

328
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,000
still some vulnerabilities and we

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
pointed out these vulnerabilities with

330
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,839
john sebastian

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
in chess 2000 in chess 2000 we showed

332
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
that there were still problems in the

333
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,040
messages method which was already

334
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
dealing with the problem of converting

335
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,440
between boolean and arithmetic

336
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,800
masking

337
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,600
so the masking as you all know is uh

338
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
the

339
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,639
the idea of basically splitting all the

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,720
intermediate variables into several

341
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
variables so that each one individually

342
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
in the case of the first order bpa

343
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920
is has a random distribution

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
this makes the first order attack for

345
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,200
instance impossible and if we

346
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,839
iterate this principle we can make the

347
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
task of the attacker grow exponentially

348
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,519
in the number of

349
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,040
shares

350
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,839
whereas the defender or task is

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,279
still linear in the number of shares

352
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
and so this is a basic idea but

353
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,079
if we want to implement it concretely we

354
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
face some difficulties because many

355
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,079
algorithms do not use only boolean or

356
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,639
only arithmetic functions but mix the

357
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,839
two of them

358
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,800
and so uh for instance

359
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,519
at this all this this first slide they

360
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,680
are taken from my presentation hs 2001

361
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,399
so at this time we were considering

362
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
aes candidates such as mars

363
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,079
rc

364
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
rc-6 to fish and there was also idea

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
in the

366
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
in the field

367
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,279
and the problem

368
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,000
is that they use both uh

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
kind of operations boolean and

370
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,519
arithmetic and so we need sometimes to

371
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
have a bouillon masking sometimes to

372
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,160
have arithmetic masking

373
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
these are

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,959
here

375
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,320
on the formulas

376
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
and the problem

377
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,360
is us to convert from one masking one

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
kind of masking to the other one and

379
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
backwards

380
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
and and this was

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
yeah exactly the problem we we studied

382
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
at this time

383
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,440
so i will not enter into the details but

384
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,320
uh

385
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
so these are

386
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
notation but basically the main

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
probably the main discovery was that

388
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
this function so the function here which

389
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
uh consider

390
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
a constant and then absorbs a constant

391
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,440
with a variable and then

392
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
subtract the variable everything is

393
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
computed modulo 2 to the k

394
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,360
this function

395
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,639
doesn't seem to be a fine but in fact it

396
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,320
is it is an undefined function of rgf2

397
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
so this was a surprise many people were

398
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,560
very uh

399
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,720
surprised by that some were not

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
believing it was true but if it is

401
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
if we try to prove it it's not difficult

402
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
but it's uh it was a big surprise to

403
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,680
discover that this function was a fine

404
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
without gf2

405
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,519
and when you know that this function is

406
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,320
refined in fact it's exactly

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
the function

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,440
that is suited for the boolean to

409
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,920
arithmetic masking so you just have

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
basically to use

411
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
these functions

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
introducing a

413
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,959
random value in it to convert between

414
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,399
one

415
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,199
kind of masking to the other one

416
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
basically you you have to compute x

417
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,800
prime zero r minus r in a dpa resistant

418
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,680
manner and to do that you introduce a

419
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
random value gamma here and you compute

420
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,360
all this and this is

421
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
the same result

422
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,279
for a for big a

423
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,560
because of the defined property of the

424
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,160
of this function and since you you

425
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,560
introduce this random value game gamma

426
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,279
you can prove that we what we did you

427
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
can prove that it is indeed resistant to

428
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,839
a dpa in the first

429
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,240
order so this gives a very simple

430
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
algorithm uh

431
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
which uh he's written here it's only a

432
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,399
few

433
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,279
examples and subtraction here

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
so this was the first uh

435
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
the first direction and the other so

436
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
then this requires five zero

437
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,120
instructions and two subtractions

438
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
uh for the other direction arithmetic to

439
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
boolean it's a bit more difficult

440
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
we

441
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,079
had to use a recursion formula it's not

442
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,560
only it's not only one

443
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
formula you have to iterate

444
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,359
the formula and this iteration has to be

445
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,160
done

446
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,800
on a

447
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,919
[Music]

448
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
number of time which is a

449
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,559
number of bits of the registers you are

450
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
using in the

451
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
in the

452
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,679
variables

453
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,799
so this is the the formula it's uh

454
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
again it can be proven not

455
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,839
it's not so easy to prove but you can do

456
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,520
it

457
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
when you

458
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,600
when you want and

459
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
this gives uh

460
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,150
the same kind of uh

461
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,320
[Music]

462
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,640
of idea you

463
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
you can use this uh

464
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,840
recursion formula by introducing

465
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,480
again random variable and it can be

466
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,799
proven again that

467
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
if you introduce this gamma random

468
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
variable everything during the recursion

469
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
formulas

470
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
remains resistant to a first order dpa

471
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
so the algorithm is

472
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
looks similar here

473
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
there are

474
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,520
xor and it also use and operation

475
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,320
and

476
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,039
doubling also and

477
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,600
but here you can see there is a loop the

478
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,559
loop is exactly corresponding to the

479
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,080
fact that you

480
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
we are

481
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
we have a number of operation and

482
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
computation time which is proportional

483
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,440
to the size of the registers

484
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,559
so you can see it here there are five k

485
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
plus five elementary operations k is the

486
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,880
size of the registers

487
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
so this is a very brief summary of the

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
paper and the conclusion of the

489
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
talk in 2001

490
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,320
uh was uh okay that we did that and an

491
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,200
open problem was to try to improve it to

492
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
improve it

493
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
especially the the direction arithmetic

494
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
to boolean was not

495
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
very satisfying if the size of the

496
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,840
registers became

497
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
bigger uh

498
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
at this time there were many uh for

499
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
instance smart cards with eight bit

500
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
registers but uh it was clear that we

501
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
were going to 32 bits registers and so

502
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
it was becoming more and more

503
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,200
important to do that

504
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,080
so in the next slide i try to

505
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
uh

506
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
to cite some

507
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,799
more recent results that were inspired

508
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,160
by this uh

509
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
paper and this and this question at the

510
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,400
end of the of the paper

511
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
so the first direction was to improve

512
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,320
uh exactly what i did what i said uh to

513
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,720
improve the the performances of this

514
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
conversion so the the first idea by jean

515
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,640
sebastian cohen and alex h schulkin was

516
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
to use some kind of time memory

517
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,440
trade-off so they proposed several

518
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,039
hs 2003 they proposed a method based on

519
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,240
precomputed tables and there were many

520
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
subsequent papers uh improving the size

521
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,360
of these tables and then there was a

522
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,640
i would say a big discovery in fac

523
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,200
2015

524
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,159
by

525
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,980
coron

526
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,320
[Music]

527
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
and they showed that the arithmetic to

528
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,320
boolean was

529
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,559
doable with only a logarithmic

530
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,520
complexity so it means log of k instead

531
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
of k

532
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
operations

533
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,320
they use the

534
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,760
specific

535
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
adder the cog stone adder which is a

536
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,799
variant

537
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
which allows to to use a carry not one

538
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,679
bit after another but several bits at

539
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
the same time

540
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,280
and it was uh also a bit improved in

541
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,440
cardis 2017 by bear yukov dino lecor and

542
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
ludovenko

543
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
with some

544
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
between 14

545
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,880
and 19

546
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
improvement of the of the speed

547
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
another direction was to generalize

548
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,640
all these conversions for higher order

549
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,360
dpa so this was uh

550
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,720
studied also by jean sebastian coron

551
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,440
and others

552
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
i cannot

553
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,200
cite all the name but you see you see

554
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
them on the on the slide

555
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,840
uh in more recent papers just 2004 14

556
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,799
just to 2017

557
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,760
uh

558
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,360
18 and

559
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
the journal of cryptographic engineering

560
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,840
in 2019

561
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
the question of the proof was also

562
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,159
important as i mentioned the the

563
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
the reason i was interested in this

564
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
problem was the fact that there was a

565
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
vulnerability in the messages

566
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
method but the messages method had no

567
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
proof so that's a sign that proofs are

568
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
important so

569
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,679
my paper had a proof as i mentioned and

570
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
there were some other problems later for

571
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
instance the

572
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
the table based um

573
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,200
method by cohen chulkin

574
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,760
had a bug which was found by blondin de

575
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,559
breze in chess

576
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,120
2012

577
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
and

578
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,679
she proposed the fix but there was

579
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
another flaw in the fixed fraud

580
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
found recently by von bayern donk don

581
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,159
verse and ingrid verbaude in this year

582
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
in hs 2021

583
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
and higher order generalizations

584
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
as

585
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
mentioned before were proven the isw

586
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,120
framework for private circuits

587
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
and i finished by some applications so

588
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,200
there are obvious applications which

589
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,559
were already

590
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,159
clear at the time in chess 2001 for

591
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,360
block and

592
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
block ciphers so it's

593
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,520
ciphers should not be there

594
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
block ciphers

595
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,679
as i mentioned already

596
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
including are arx constructions

597
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
hash functions so there were

598
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,679
many

599
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,799
use of these methods for implementing

600
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,120
hash functions and of course

601
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
more

602
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
frequently it was a hmac

603
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,440
function because we need a key

604
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,720
for

605
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
this being uh

606
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,679
interesting

607
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,679
and also stream cyphers

608
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
uh and in more generally uh

609
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,240
at chess this year uh there is a paper

610
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
for instance about

611
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,279
a set an instruction set extension to

612
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
support

613
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
generally masking in a software context

614
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,760
and this includes some

615
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
this includes the problem of

616
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
converting between boolean and

617
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,919
arithmetic

618
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
and for uh more recent applications so

619
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,840
there was one in chess 2006 by proof

620
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
jiro and romanie

621
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,799
based on fourier transforms to secure

622
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,159
s-box implementations against epa

623
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,200
so this is used as a tool the conversion

624
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,320
between

625
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
arithmetic and boolean and more recently

626
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,760
as

627
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
benedict already

628
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,000
mentioned there are some use of these

629
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
conversions for public key cryptographic

630
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
algorithms uh there was one at eurocrypt

631
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,360
2018 uh the glp lattice based the

632
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,840
signature scheme at any order and

633
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
more

634
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,279
and also

635
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
some post quantum

636
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,000
candidates

637
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,919
for instance

638
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,320
this year this paper about the

639
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,960
protection of saber against

640
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,880
against uh

641
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
side channel attacks

642
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,039
and last word maybe uh

643
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,000
the it could also be there are some

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,919
similar problems if you want for

645
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,400
instance to uh consider white box

646
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
implementation for instance the the

647
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,840
chess one of the two chess 2021

648
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,679
challenges was about implementing y-box

649
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
e-c-d-s-a and if you

650
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
dig into the problem you see that

651
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
e-c-d-s-a also uses different

652
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,440
structures algebraic structures the one

653
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
about the elliptic curve and then you

654
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,550
have to switch to

655
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,000
[Music]

656
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,919
integers modulo

657
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,559
the cardinal

658
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,720
the number of points of the of the curve

659
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,480
and this also creates some problems if

660
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,120
you want to mask everything and so there

661
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
are

662
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,380
some ideas coming from

663
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,000
[Music]

664
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
the conversions

665
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
also arising in this kind of problem

666
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
which are specific to whitebox because

667
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
ecdsf

668
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,039
is easier to protect in the classical

669
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,440
dpa setting than in the whitebox

670
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
the whitebox model

671
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,440
okay so that's what i uh

672
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
what i was happy to say about this paper

673
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,840
and thank you thanks again for uh

674
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
for uh

675
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,000
choosing this paper

676
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,799
thank you very much thank you very much

677
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,400
louis

678
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
um nice recap of what happened

679
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
um

680
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
so we started a little bit later so

681
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
therefore i think it's also fine if we

682
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
go a little bit over time if there are

683
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
any questions um i i'm not keeping an

684
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,799
eye on the zulipchat so if you have

685
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
questions please i don't know just

686
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
unmute yourself and ask or or write them

687
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
here in the chat

688
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
and we can

689
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
take a look at

690
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,799
those um

691
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,159
otherwise

692
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,600
i would still you know i would still

693
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
come back with my question um impact and

694
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,679
industry i know it's hard to say

695
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,600
something about that but okay so we know

696
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,200
you were working industry so i guess

697
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,640
this was a

698
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
yeah i mean the real work problem and

699
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
not just some hobby

700
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,920
yeah so the impact in the industry is um

701
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,279
[Music]

702
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,360
uh

703
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,799
is

704
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
yeah it's never easy to understand

705
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,279
because there are some secrets of

706
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,919
company secrets about that but as you as

707
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,080
you mentioned there are also patents

708
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,559
that were

709
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
filled

710
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,650
for

711
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,919
[Music]

712
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
for this

713
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
method

714
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
so it's

715
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
the first thing is that it protected

716
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,440
for some companies it protected their

717
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,399
their

718
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,200
way of implementing

719
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
it and it was really used uh to uh

720
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,120
for some uh some algorithm especially i

721
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
i know that for the

722
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
hmac

723
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,000
uh

724
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,919
implementation it was uh often used to

725
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,640
to convert between boolean and masking

726
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,120
in this way or in

727
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
in derived derived ways

728
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
so it's uh it's an important application

729
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,279
for hmac

730
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
hmac applications

731
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
for um

732
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
yeah so uh for ds or a yes i'm

733
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
not sure it was uh

734
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,640
so

735
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
so important because there was other

736
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,039
ways there were other ways of dealing

737
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,880
with a problem but

738
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
yeah

739
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,840
it's uh

740
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,799
because

741
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,679
yeah

742
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,000
you can use other representations of

743
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
these boxes there are many ways of

744
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,279
dealing with a problem but yeah it was

745
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,000
uh

746
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,159
it was important and as i mentioned and

747
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,880
probably it's uh it's going more and

748
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
more important now for the post quantum

749
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,799
uh

750
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,600
latest based basically uh

751
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,080
candidates

752
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,000
but it's it's less

753
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,799
sensitive question because the patterns

754
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,159
as you chose

755
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,880
20 years for the test of time

756
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,600
it means that the patterns are over

757
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,799
so

758
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,799
exactly

759
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,440
okay so we have we have two other

760
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,279
questions in the chat the first one is

761
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,080
um is it possible to obtain a similar a

762
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,360
fine map modulo a prime

763
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,039
um so not just the power of two

764
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,279
uh

765
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,480
i

766
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
don't know no as far as i know

767
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
it's not that it's not possible to

768
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
directly obtain something similar for

769
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,120
for primes so it's uh it has to be

770
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
studied differently here as a all the

771
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
method is based on

772
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,080
a very specific property of the of

773
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
integers modulo 2 to the k so it's um

774
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,559
yeah okay

775
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,480
and the other question is um can we get

776
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,559
an algorithm for a to b

777
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,360
that is independent of the word size

778
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,919
for first order just like between we

779
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,120
don't know it's an open problem it's uh

780
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,919
the best we can do at the moment is log

781
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,039
of k

782
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,600
and we we don't have a proof that it's

783
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
impossible to

784
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
to be in constant

785
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
time

786
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,720
with respect to the size of the

787
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
registers but yeah we don't know it's an

788
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
open problem

789
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
okay thank you very much again

790
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,320
congratulations for the award

791
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,120
thank you i suggest we stop here we do

792
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,200
five minutes break and then start almost

793
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,080
on time with the next session
