00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,040
hi everyone i'm rachael from delicious

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,080
paris

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
in this video i'm going to present our

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
work on how to quantify information

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,920
literature

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
including code-based masking this is a

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
joint work with shivanki

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
claude garcia susan menachem and

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
janukatanji

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
in this talk

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
we first gave an introduction of

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
code-based masking then present our

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
protein theoretical liquid

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
quantification

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,800
we

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,840
apply it to the phenomena masking which

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
is based on charmian's secret sharing

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
and show how the redundancy in masking

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
can only increase the side channel

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,399
leakages

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
in fashion analysis a sensitive variable

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
x is a 18 in certain forms

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
then the leakage can be viewed as a

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
combination of some functional x

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,680
and

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
alloys and

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
a commonly used city is assuming

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,840
environment

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,520
noises the additive white equation noise

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
so to protect a

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
cryptographic implementation

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
one of the most way

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
established contributor is the masking

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
in particular the masking provides

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
probable security and it is in

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
the algorithm like a big level

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
its cost

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
increasing critically with the security

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,439
order

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,960
typically in polio masking lettex is a

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
sensitive variable

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
y is the masks and zip is a mask's

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,600
variable

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
then given ancients its encoding is as

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
follows

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
the first chain is

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
is constructed by

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
xor with the secret as the sensitive

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,880
variable and

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
all as the masks

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,038
and as the strands are the

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,080
random mask only

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
as we know

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
the mass as a brilliant masking can be

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,920
unionized into the code based masking

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,959
from

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,599
codeine theoretical perspective

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
let us say b k pieces of

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,239
inform

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
and that is a equal to x g plus y h

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,640
where x

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
has uh key pieces of information

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
why has tmasks and design be

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,879
encoded into z with ancients

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
g and h are two general matrices of an

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
inequality and d respectively

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
so we note that the only condition in

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,640
code-based in generalized code-based

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,080
masking

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
is that cmt has only zero code word in

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
the intersection

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
in addition if n equal to k plus t

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
there is no redundancy like in rpm and

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
direct sum masking otherwise if n is

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
greater than

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
k plus t the masking is a redundant

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
here we give two examples

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
the brilliant masking and

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
the inner product masking

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
on the left the blue masking is the

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,480
simplest encoding without an xor

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
the g and h are binary matrices with

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
only ones and zeros

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
on the right in ipm

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
the first chain is constructed with in

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
the product

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,799
operation involving rfi

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,720
as we show fi i in the first column of h

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,439
comparing with the plain masking only

90
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,760
one column is changed

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,560
and we can recover the brilliant one by

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
setting off i

93
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,080
equal to one

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
so the blade masking is the special case

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,040
of

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
ipm

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
next we present a brief history of code

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
based masking note that these references

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,478
marked in blue are the first proposals

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,639
the observation the first

101
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
observation is that the little screen

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
and the phenomena masking will propose

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
the in 2011

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
and the original ibm was 2012.

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
at last the most general case was

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,759
proposed in chess

107
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,639
2020

108
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
in this paper we'll focus on this

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
journal case and show how to quantify

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
the information literature

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,080
the connection between above masking

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,560
schemes are showing figure three

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
we highlight

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,520
two groups

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
first thing on the left we have a ratio

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
dough

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
including bone masking in a product

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
masking and leakage screen and also

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,639
direct sun mating

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,199
they all have no redundancy

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,280
on the right so we have a

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
column in a masking which is based on

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,160
shamyang's secret sharing

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
it has it can be configured with

125
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,039
redundancy in a glitch free context

126
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,479
context

127
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
therefore two natural questions that

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
series

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
how to measure information leakage in

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,199
different scheme

131
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,639
and the secondary

132
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
how to choose the optimal parentheses or

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
optimal code for each scheme

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
before we move into details i will

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
recall some definitions and the

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
transformation

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
the first one is the two distance

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
as the dual code delos as cpap

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
gave an inequality it's a dual code is

140
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
that each code of each codeword array

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
is also going to all cut code words in d

142
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,039
next uh some substandard representation

143
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,479
and code expansion by which we can

144
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,800
extend an inner code from a bigger

145
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
finite five to a sub three and f2

146
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,479
next

147
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
as the

148
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
awareness notion is called with a

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
numerator

150
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,319
which denotes an inner code to

151
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
with the phenomena

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
for an inequality of parent term

153
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,400
kt

154
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
it's a written numerator is as follows

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
the coefficient of bi is the number of

156
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
code words of handwritten i

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
in particular bd is called the casing

158
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
number of b

159
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,360
for instance

160
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
for the linear code 844 we have a b0

161
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
equal to one

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,840
b4 equal to 14 and the p8 is a

163
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,759
one in addition we can define the

164
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,919
adjuster casing number of two linear

165
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
code c and d

166
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
so b prime d is the number of code words

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,280
such that there's a code or die

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
in

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
quantity but not in policy

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
next i will show how to measure the

171
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,680
necklace in code base masking

172
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
in this work we consider two preview

173
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,319
models

174
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
in the bit probably model each program

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
only gets

176
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
one bit of information

177
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,599
while in

178
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,199
waterproofing model each propagate

179
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
elevates the information

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,160
the corresponding security order are tb

181
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
and tw respectively

182
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
so in side channel analysis the leakage

183
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
function turns a bit vector into

184
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
a real value

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
which are denoted as a procedural

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,039
linear function p

187
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
then the numerical degree is defined as

188
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,919
the maximum number of coordinates of

189
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,120
beta

190
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
which is the coefficient

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
of z power i

192
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
in liquid function p

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
some some some examples are as follows

194
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,280
for msb and the lsb in differential

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
power analysis

196
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
which is

197
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
current

198
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
commonly known as the dom

199
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,199
z power i is

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
is always the only one called the knight

201
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
of one

202
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,719
in the midway selected model each bit

203
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,279
appears only once and they return to

204
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,080
their

205
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,200
their sum

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,080
in both cases the degree

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
equals one

208
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
and the last example has the second

209
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,560
order liquidus

210
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,640
with a product of

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
first two bits

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
it has a

213
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
it has a numerical degree equal to two

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,800
then by using liquid function p we can

215
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
define the

216
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,480
saturn linkage as

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
electrical to pj plus and with gaussian

218
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,000
noise

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
the then the problem is the how to

220
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
explode the leakage

221
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
in side channel analysis the distinguish

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
is to check whether the leakages and the

223
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
different value of x are different

224
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
correspond to whether the variance is

225
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
zero or not

226
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
therefore we can define the sr as the

227
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
ratio between the variance of

228
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,760
information and the range of noise as in

229
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
combination

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
taking hemi weight leakage into

231
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,000
consideration we have pj equal to

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,959
hemorrhage of j with power d for high

233
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,519
order moment

234
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
then it can be decomposed as follows

235
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
as in

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
equation 6.

237
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
the first part are the terms with the

238
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
numerical degree smaller than p y in the

239
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
second part

240
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,959
with degree exactly equal to d

241
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,680
therefore we have the following theorem

242
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
for asana

243
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
in code-based masking so inter it

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,800
involves the two distance t and the

245
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,079
adjacency number b prime d which depends

246
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
on both

247
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,760
uh called the cmd so it consists it is

248
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,279
consistent with

249
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
the security order improving model

250
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
next from an information theoretic

251
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,640
perspective

252
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
the mutual information between the

253
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
literature and the sensitive variable x

254
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
is computed by two entropies

255
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,000
the total entropy hl and the conditional

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
entropy h elective x are given as

257
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,920
follows

258
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,959
so

259
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
then we have the following theorem for

260
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
visualization

261
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
in code-based masking so as in equation

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
8 we have a

263
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
mutual mission between l and x equals 0

264
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
when the degree of p is smaller than

265
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
zero

266
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,079
which is a consistent with probably

267
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,040
model

268
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,079
a proven security order and if the

269
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,160
degree

270
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
of p equals the two distance

271
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
the mutual motion is linked to the two

272
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,920
distance and

273
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
adjust the casing number

274
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,040
as in asana

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
visually we industry say the impact of

276
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
two distance and

277
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
adjusted the casing number as in figure

278
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
four

279
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
in particular the slope of the course in

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
log log

281
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
representation

282
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
is equal to slope

283
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
and

284
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
uh

285
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,399
and the vertical offset is linked to the

286
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,680
b prime b

287
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,279
an example

288
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
of 4 bit cases of tuition

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,639
rpm is shown in figure 5

290
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
the slope and the vertical offset are as

291
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,560
expected

292
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,920
therefore we propose a unified

293
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
evaluation framework for gcm

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
in which

295
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,360
the side channel security can be

296
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,920
characterized by the two distance and

297
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,519
the adjusticacy number in addition

298
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
the optimal code can be given by

299
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
maximizing

300
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
the duration d and minimizing the

301
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,880
adjust the question number

302
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,399
b prime d

303
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
we next

304
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,120
apply our approach to access-based

305
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
phenomena masking

306
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
as pointed out in chest 2018 the

307
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
phenomena masking is

308
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,959
connected to

309
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,360
the reducing code

310
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,160
the

311
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,200
the ice code is defined by choosing a

312
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
phenomena with

313
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
order equal smaller than t and evaluate

314
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
its m public point

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
then

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
we can

317
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
then we can show

318
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,399
the connection exceed explicitly the

319
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,240
generation matrices of gnh as follows

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
in particular each share corresponds to

321
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,800
an evaluation unites the reduction code

322
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
next considering

323
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,480
an instance with the solutions and the t

324
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
code 21

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,399
which is the first order secure masking

326
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,720
tnh as follows for the sake of

327
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,079
simplicity and also because of

328
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
the equal equivalence of body in the

329
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,519
code we can set fi alpha one equal to

330
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,639
one

331
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,000
and

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
the other two parameters are alpha two

333
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,720
and f three i equal to alpha power g and

334
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,079
i have power t

335
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,279
respectively the sharing is that the

336
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
equation ten where we only have one

337
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
random mask want

338
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,720
so by applying sim2 for mutual mission

339
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,440
we can evaluate different code in ss

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
based masking clearly the black curve

341
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,880
the best

342
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
code

343
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
under the approximation in symmetry are

344
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,000
more accurate when the noise increases

345
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
next we give an exhaustive study list in

346
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
table one

347
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,079
different code can have various

348
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
two distance and

349
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
they're just the case number

350
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,920
as shown in the last column

351
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,199
we give

352
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
the best cases of code

353
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,079
for

354
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,000
31 as a space masking and the comparing

355
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,279
of comparing with the state of that

356
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,680
we show a systematic approach to find

357
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,199
the best code

358
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,160
innovation will show that some

359
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
parameters are

360
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
the worst

361
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
the worst cases

362
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
and are not too recommended for

363
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,800
practical use

364
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
in particular for the first time we

365
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,120
illustrated the

366
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
impact of

367
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,519
both

368
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,120
called the cnt

369
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,560
in its exceptional resistance of gcm

370
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,759
i didn't also evaluate the impact of

371
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,320
redundancy in coding in code-based

372
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
masking

373
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
again we record the sharing in 3-1

374
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,040
essays based masking

375
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,399
we have a one-chain for redundancy

376
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
we will compare the information carrying

377
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,399
in the in the section and in two out of

378
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,279
situations by using mutual mission

379
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,160
the results are shown in figure seven

380
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,759
on the left

381
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,279
we have

382
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,560
we show that

383
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
three combinations of tuitions have the

384
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
same

385
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,360
same two distance and down the right so

386
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
we

387
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
give one instance of company combination

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
that has small smaller decisions

389
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,639
two observations can be made

390
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,399
firstly solutions always carries

391
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
carry much information than tuition and

392
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
secondary

393
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
the security is determined by

394
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,720
the weak

395
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
which is combination of

396
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
two chains and in general cases it's

397
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
determined by

398
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
t out of n chancing

399
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
access-based

400
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
phenomena masking

401
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,560
assuming

402
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
a similar result is showing you guys for

403
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
different chords and

404
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,680
different combinations

405
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
finally we conclude our talk

406
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
so in this paper we perform the coding

407
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,839
theoretical approach to quantify the

408
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,240
side channel resistance of

409
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
the code the base masking

410
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
we use both asana and mri as

411
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,799
liquidity metrics and the proposal

412
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,400
unified the framework for evaluation

413
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
and for choosing optimal code in gsm

414
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,480
so our

415
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
our open source are in github available

416
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,320
by using following uniques

417
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
we also

418
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
highlight

419
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
that

420
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
we want to show

421
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
how to find the best code by

422
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
presenting detail on the investigation

423
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
on the trace of signal basis

424
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
for

425
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,360
code expansion from a big identifier to

426
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
specify basically size f2

427
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,440
improve

428
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
improves on september 17.

429
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
just have chess so welcome to our talk

430
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
and

431
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,200
please take check our paper for details
