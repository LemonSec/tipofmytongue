7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,080
virtual

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,119
chess

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,720
since last year

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
so

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
before before it starts let me give you

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
a quick report

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,399
about the organization so we have 450

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,920
participants

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
i think the data was three hours ago we

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,079
still see registrations coming

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,480
141 student registrations

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,680
we also have a uh newly created taser

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,399
workshop um i will talk a little bit in

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,480
the in the next slide

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
um we have actually 250 86 participants

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,239
for the the first edition of this

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,719
workshop which is quite good

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
and we have 32 of the registrations are

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,039
only for for the taser workshop

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,400
um the participants come from 48

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,360
countries

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
which are marked in blue in the in the

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,119
map as you can see

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
in terms of numbers uh

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
united states ranks number one with 75

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
participants

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
germany and china ranked number two and

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
three so these are the uh countries with

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
uh more than 10 participants

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
if we look at the numbers per continent

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,040
we can say that

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
europe basically accounts for half of

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
the registrations so it's still there

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
really the gravity center

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
um and china and u.s sorry asian and u.s

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
asian and america are the the second and

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
third continent with a number of

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,439
registrations

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,360
and and we can see that in terms of

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
population

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
uh africa and latin america are still

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
underrepresented so perhaps in the

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,799
future we could promote more uh chase in

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
this places

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
so this year we have a five days of

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
program um

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
