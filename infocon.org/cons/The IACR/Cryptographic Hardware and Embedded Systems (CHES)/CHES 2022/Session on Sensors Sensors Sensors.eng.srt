1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,980
okay

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,580
uh so welcome to the to one of the last

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,120
sessions of this year's chess

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,600
uh so this is a sensors session as you

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,420
know uh we have three talks in the

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,240
session two in person actually from the

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,580
same person if I'm not wrong and one

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,680
online presentation a video presentation

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,700
and the first one is why Thai a tiny

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,899
self-calibrating sensor for power

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,360
variation measurement for uh in fpgas

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,000
and our speakers Brian urugama yeah

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,780
thank you

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,059
yeah thank you so this talk is going to

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,940
be about VT and area efficient on chip

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,739
sensor that can calibrate itself to

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,079
measure power variations on an fpga

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,879
and it can be used for remote power

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,520
analysis attacks so over the coming 20

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
minutes I'm going to talk about on-chip

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
power sensors and I'm going to talk

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,060
about remote power analysis attacks and

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,799
then we are going to look at the design

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,619
of our proposed VT sensor and then we

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,119
are going to see some performance

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
evaluations of our VT sensor

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,640
so first of all anchi power sensors and

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,799
remote for analysis attacks on cheap

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,540
power sensors they basically measure

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,060
variation in Signal propagation delay

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,780
and so propagation delay variations are

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,220
related to changes in the operating

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,979
condition such as Supply voltage and

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,560
what happens when the power consumption

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,500
increases is that it causes the supply

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,079
voltage to drop and as a result the

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,020
propagation delay do vary and what we

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,939
can do is we can therefore we can use

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,400
the signal propagation delay as a

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,740
measure of the power consumption

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,920
so existing on chip sensors we have time

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,479
to digital converters and ring

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,280
oscillators so these two were actually

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
invented a while ago for a different

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
purpose but now they have been used for

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,780
remote power analysis attacks and um we

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
are going to look at VT sensor during

48
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,680
this talk and in the coming talk I'm

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
going to talk about another sensor

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,319
so remote power analysis attacks they

51
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,420
basically extract cryptographic Secrets

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,540
by analyzing the power consumption

53
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,819
and they use on-chi power sensors rather

54
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,739
than physical machine equipment such as

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,120
oscilloscopes

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,760
so um given that

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
they are using on-chip sensors we can

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,020
perform remote power analysis attacks

59
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,540
remotely without even not having

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,640
physical access to the targeted chip so

61
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,700
as you can see here the in traditional

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,260
power analysis attacks we need the

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,760
measuring equipment which would give us

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,099
the Power Trace but on remote power

65
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,840
analysis attacks we are using a non-chip

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,580
sensor that gives us the Power Trace and

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,400
deploying this request no physical

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,440
access so we can do remote par analysis

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,680
attacks on a device that we have no

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
physical access to

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,099
and the typical Target for remote

72
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,420
analysis attacks is AES and again remote

73
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,879
analysis attacks are sort of a good

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,620
indication on the sensitivity of the

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,780
on-chip sensor because we are looking at

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,060
small power fluctuations

77
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,000
and to evaluate how good the remote

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,620
power analysis attack is we are going to

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,080
use key rank as the performance metric

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,260
and key rank it's basically the key of

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,360
the correct key when all key cases are

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,099
sorted using the information that we

83
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,420
recovered with the RPA attack and uh key

84
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,140
rank being it it's a key sorry being it

85
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,720
it's a rank it gives

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,840
us a decreasing value so the lower the

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,299
value is the better the uh the remote

88
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,980
power analysis attacking so we ideally

89
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,720
want key rank to be

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,420
uh one which means we have fully

91
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,099
recovered the key

92
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,459
and some uh comparisons between existing

93
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,440
sensors uh time to digital converters

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,940
and ring oscillator so

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,239
if you look at the placement and routing

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,099
so ring oscillators we can place them

97
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,019
arbitrarily but time to digital

98
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,180
converters we can't place them wherever

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,159
we want because they got a long carry

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
chain and that constraints where we can

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,239
put them

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
and if you look at some characteristic

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,978
features ring oscillators they got a

104
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,220
combinational loop and the bad thing

105
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,779
with combinational Loop is that they are

106
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,440
used for power viruses and in remote in

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,900
Cloud fpgs now they have been blocked so

108
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,780
you can deploy uh bring oscillators on

109
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,060
cloud fpgas

110
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,639
and on the at the same time with time to

111
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,740
digital converters we have latches and

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
latches they are not very preferable in

113
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,720
sequential circuits because they are it

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,680
gives us a hard time in figuring out the

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,699
propagation time

116
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,000
so and uh in addition they got Long

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,220
Carry chains which can be visually

118
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,800
observed on the floor plan

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,680
and on the other hand

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
um time to digital converters we can

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,580
perform a successful attack with just

122
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,860
one sensor but ring oscillators we need

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,220
several of them usually about 64. and um

124
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,199
then the next thing resource requirement

125
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,479
per sensor so time to digital converters

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,060
they are pretty good at they require

127
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,820
pretty high resources they each though

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,040
One sensor Works in each that sensor

129
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,259
needs about 34 fpga slices but ring

130
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,400
oscillators

131
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,759
One sensor just needs two fpga slices

132
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,720
but

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,880
note that we need about 64 of them which

134
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,360
means we need 128 fpg slices for a a

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,880
good remote power analysis attack

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,120
and then the alignment of the samples

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,160
um time to digital converters we get

138
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,680
align samples but spring oscillators

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,840
they can be misaligned

140
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,539
and all in all we can see that there are

141
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,580
some preferable features that we would

142
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,479
like to have on and on chip sensors like

143
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,000
arbitrary replace it and Route it and

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,220
then to have an attack done with one

145
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
sensor and having lower resource

146
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,560
consumption and then producing samples

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
that are aligned so those are some

148
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,860
preferable things that you would like to

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,440
have but given that the existing ones

150
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,600
were defined for some were designed for

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,580
some other tasks they are not producing

152
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,820
they are not giving all the the desired

153
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,280
features but they do have some desired

154
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,979
features but um so with these funds

155
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,660
having in mind let's have a look at our

156
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,360
proposed VT sensor design so it's the

157
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
block diagram of VTA looks like this and

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,479
the key components are as shown here

159
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,400
so the first one we are going to look at

160
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,100
is this ideally a g element it which is

161
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,620
identical to the following ideal AC

162
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,440
element as well and so it's basically an

163
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,199
adjustable input delay element we can

164
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,759
visualize it in sort of like a volume

165
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,100
slider which we can slide it

166
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,380
ah but instead of the volume we can

167
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,560
change the delay that it induces on the

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,960
signal that it passes through it

169
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,660
and uh so the next part is this tab

170
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,780
delay line which is essentially a series

171
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,720
of uh cascaded and Gates

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,280
and um

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,460
we know the the end Gates produces one

174
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,919
as the output when only both the inputs

175
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,660
are one so we are going to use that

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,000
property here so when we want to enable

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,759
the sensor we set this enable signal to

178
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,960
one

179
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,539
then immediately these points will

180
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,160
become one as well

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,099
and then when the clock Rises what

182
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,160
happens is so we have this point

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,780
becoming one

184
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,020
and then the signal propagates through

185
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,340
this ideal AG element here and of course

186
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,860
it takes a bit of time because and that

187
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,560
time is determined by the designer and

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,699
then what happens is this TDL in becomes

189
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,620
one so now the first and gate got both

190
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,620
the inputs one and after the signal

191
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,780
propagates through the and gate we would

192
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,960
see a one at its output and this now we

193
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,060
can see that the second and Gates got

194
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,819
both the inputs being one so it would

195
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,620
the signal would propagate through it

196
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,979
taking a bit of time and we would see an

197
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,800
one at its output so the same thing goes

198
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,060
on

199
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,240
and while that's happening

200
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,340
we have another path where the signal

201
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,379
can propagate so what happens there is

202
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,300
when the clock is one

203
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,000
we have uh the signal propagating

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,460
through the ideal AC element and it

205
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,199
triggers the clock signal for these flip

206
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,080
flops now both of these things happen at

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
the same time so let's have a look at

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,299
how things would happen when uh both of

209
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,940
these things work simultaneously so

210
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,679
while the signal propagates through the

211
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,940
TDL

212
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,640
this uh and then halfway through the

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,740
clock would trigger so what would happen

214
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,440
is we would see a series of ones because

215
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,060
the signal managed to propagate through

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,339
them but for some cases we would see

217
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,500
zeros because the signal didn't reach so

218
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,300
far

219
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,800
and so the clock triggered before

220
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,320
actually the signal reached there

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,300
so um

222
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,600
then as I just mentioned a while ago the

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
power consumption is proportional to the

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
propagation DeLay So when we when the

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,019
power consumption is low what would

226
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,300
happen is the propagation delay is low

227
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,860
which means the signal can propagate

228
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,399
quickly so it would manage to reach a

229
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,100
certain and gate so we would by the time

230
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,019
the flip flops get triggered so we would

231
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,839
see some number of ones followed by some

232
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,279
number of zeros but when the power

233
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,860
consumption is high what would happen is

234
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,260
the signal would not manage to reach so

235
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,500
far so just before it reaches there what

236
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,700
would happen is the clock would get

237
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,420
triggered so we instead of having many

238
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,860
zeros we would have fewer number of

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,800
zeros sorry fewer number of ones

240
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,720
and uh

241
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,620
so that's the key part of the uh VT

242
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,420
sensor so we have few more additional

243
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,880
components to assist the key parts to a

244
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,940
this uh calibration FSM highlighted here

245
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,620
it's essentially

246
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,760
uh the control logic that controls uh

247
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,220
how much delay this this ideal AG

248
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,860
element induces and then we got a memory

249
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,060
to store the outputs from the flip flops

250
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,800
and that's where the power traces are

251
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,220
stored in and um so that's basically how

252
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,080
the VT sensor looks

253
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,320
so the four features that we discussed

254
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
and saw in the existing sensors the so

255
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,620
VT satisfies all four of them in

256
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,920
addition we managed to design a sensor

257
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
that is

258
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,440
in the resource requirement is

259
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,360
independent of the clock frequency so VT

260
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,180
no matter how freak how how the

261
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,920
frequency is we still need the same

262
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,240
number of resources

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
and then we have this built-in automatic

264
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,680
runtime calibration mechanism built into

265
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,899
the sensor design

266
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,920
so a few performance evaluations with uh

267
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,200
our VT sensor so we specifically look at

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,940
a four bit scenario

269
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,700
and um so first we'll have a look at

270
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,779
what happens when we move the AES module

271
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,700
so uh we picked six different placements

272
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,940
for the as module as shown here and then

273
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,160
we

274
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,320
uh fixed the placement of the VT sensor

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,740
and then their frequencies

276
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,579
so this is how the

277
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,779
performance varies with the placement

278
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,300
variation so as you can see regardless

279
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,100
where we put the as module we can attack

280
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,600
it

281
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,260
um

282
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,480
but of course there is a noticeable

283
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,500
difference between different

284
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,480
configurations but no matter where we

285
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,980
put the as module we were able to attack

286
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,940
it

287
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,180
then we check the very impact of the

288
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,399
placement of the VT sensor itself so for

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,140
that we varied the placement of the VT

290
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,540
sensor to 17 different placements shown

291
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,940
here and then we place the as module

292
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,800
down here

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,500
and again we fix the frequencies as well

294
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,459
and we let the uh we let we collected

295
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,740
power traces and we ran some power

296
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,000
analysis settings

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,040
so the performance variation is as shown

298
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,079
here so

299
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,100
uh the the figure to the left it's the

300
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,120
floor plan

301
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,839
and uh so we have Selected Few uh

302
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,360
placements to represent the others so

303
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,779
one corresponds to one here corresponds

304
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,500
to one here so three nine seven sixteen

305
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,880
and Seventeen so out of those 17

306
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,380
placements we pick five of them to

307
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,440
represent the all of them so as you can

308
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,140
see some of the cases we were managed we

309
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,880
managed to get the key pretty quickly

310
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,279
but some cases they were not as good as

311
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,019
the others

312
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,839
and so the color gradient we used here

313
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,260
is so we used green to say that it's

314
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,480
easy to attack and red to say it's

315
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,339
harder to attack so we can see that

316
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,160
there's sort of a clustering here

317
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,860
and um so the takeaway point is uh so

318
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,079
the placement of BT has a significant

319
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,320
impact on the attack efficacy

320
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
so then uh we looked at what effects do

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,380
the temperature change has on its

322
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,180
performance so the thing is on chip

323
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,440
sensors they are susceptible to

324
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,060
temperature changes because a slight

325
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,639
change in temperature would cause the

326
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,260
operating condition to change and

327
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,600
therefore it would uh they are

328
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,120
susceptible to on uh temperature changes

329
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,500
so what we did was

330
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,600
we slightly modify the calibration

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,399
mechanism so that it would recalibrate

332
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,700
when there is no change observed and uh

333
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,339
so we fixed uh the placements and the

334
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,200
frequencies and then what we did was we

335
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,720
while the as module is executing we blew

336
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,579
hot air over the chip so that the chip

337
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,800
gets warmer

338
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,760
and so this is how the variation looks

339
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,279
like so the graph to the left shows how

340
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,260
we met how we change the temperature and

341
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,660
the graph to the right is the

342
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,240
corresponding variation in the key rank

343
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,420
and um so with three calibration enabled

344
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,279
BT is capable of adapting to temperature

345
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,940
changes and specifically VT can respond

346
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,680
to every changes so if you look at the

347
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,800
yellow waveform a yellow plot here so we

348
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,380
blew hot around 50 000 traces and we let

349
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,940
it naturally cool down and then around

350
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,040
70 000 prices We Believe hot air again

351
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
so it it was an Abrupt change but still

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
we can see that it eventually converges

353
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,839
and we can see that we can fully recover

354
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,660
the key at the end

355
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,000
and uh we also have a comparison between

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,579
uh the resource efficiency of BT with

357
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,980
then existing sensors

358
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,660
uh so VT we we just need one sensor and

359
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,459
the Total Resource requirement is just

360
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,620
eight fpg slices and two of these IO

361
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,500
delay elements when compared to 34 and

362
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,220
1.8 refugees for the existing ones and

363
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,199
then we just need one block Ram to store

364
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,100
the samples because it's uh each sample

365
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,079
is a fever in bits and the size of a

366
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,120
Power Trace is almost half when compared

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,420
to the time to digital converters

368
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,420
so uh in addition we experimentally

369
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,440
evaluated few more effects so we checked

370
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,540
how the frequency of the as module

371
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,899
effects on the efficacy we checked what

372
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,320
is what effects do the frequency of a VT

373
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,160
has

374
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,260
and then we checked the magnitude of the

375
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,940
power variation on the attack efficacy

376
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,060
and also we checked few properties of BT

377
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,899
we checked whether it's portable and

378
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,399
also we check whether we can deploy it

379
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,740
in Cloud so we used Amazon AWS service

380
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,660
to see whether we can deploy it on cloud

381
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,519
and then we actually managed to deploy

382
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,500
on one of these MSN AWS

383
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,160
instances

384
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,620
also we checked whether it's noise

385
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,839
tolerant and we have shown the results

386
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
in our paper

387
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,899
so for more results and information

388
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,920
kindly refer to our paper here you can

389
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,839
scan the QR code and it would direct you

390
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,560
to the our paper and we have the design

391
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,560
sources and Sample data sets submitted

392
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,720
and accepted as artifacts and you can

393
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,920
refer this link for

394
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,100
for the artifacts Associated and so in

395
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,079
conclusion in this talk we looked at

396
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,639
on-chief Power sensors and their

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,079
characteristics we looked at remote

398
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,420
power analysis attacks and but key rank

399
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,420
is we looked at the design of RBT sensor

400
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,279
and we looked at performance and

401
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,839
properties of BD

402
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,019
so it's time for questions

403
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,579
thank you very much for the talk

404
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,079
I'm just checking if we have uh could

405
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,180
you help with me

406
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,560
any questions yeah

407
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,279
hello uh thanks for the presentation I'm

408
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,100
wondering how much did you experiment

409
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,220
with the oversampling ratio because you

410
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,799
have this fixed parameter of 16 times

411
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,160
oversampling uh used now I'm I didn't

412
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,199
get it though can you repeat sorry yeah

413
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,900
um how much did you experiment with the

414
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,160
over sampling ratio

415
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,520
that is 96 megahertz uh oh yeah okay so

416
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,540
um we had

417
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,760
um so the AES module was executed at six

418
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,299
megahertz and then we did uh sort of

419
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,400
over sampling just to make sure that the

420
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,380
samples actually didn't matter very much

421
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,679
though but we just did um we ran these

422
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,679
circuit data at a higher frequency just

423
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,299
um sort of having a redundancy but it

424
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,640
didn't matter anyways

425
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,320
foreign

426
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,220
yeah so there are other results

427
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,120
in fact Oh Why didn't it work

428
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,559
there are some other results actually

429
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,240
like on the paper we have shown some

430
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,880
results which we managed to break AES

431
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,160
with the same frequency as the sampling

432
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
frequency

433
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,660
all right thank you I did I answer your

434
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,240
question or yeah it sounds like I need

435
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,740
to read the paper okay

436
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,500
any other questions

437
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
from the audience

438
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
yeah so

439
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,559
oh yeah sorry

440
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,360
um can you tell me a little bit more

441
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
about how did how why you are saying

442
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,919
that it is auto calibrating and where do

443
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,320
you store the calibration data and how

444
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,059
do you utilize the calibration data

445
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,280
actually okay so there is one more

446
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,660
question maybe you can answer this I

447
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,559
think

448
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,840
okay so basically calibration what we do

449
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,299
is we so it's more like to visualize

450
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,760
it's more like I am adjusting that a

451
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,559
volume slider kind of a thing so I with

452
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,039
a with a logic circuit I let let it

453
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,140
calibrate to a point where I could start

454
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,299
seeing the variation happening

455
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,380
and um then we so we just lock it there

456
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,380
afterwards so you mean to calibrate the

457
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,440
i o delay module but not the output uh

458
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,299
of the flops which you are storing in

459
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,760
the memory no so we look at the output

460
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,100
of the flops of course but that that

461
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,440
that's being fed as an input to the the

462
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,419
i o delay the logic circuit but then we

463
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,880
just calibrate the um the iodily element

464
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,820
itself and and the last question from my

465
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,840
side is

466
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,640
um I mean what's your

467
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,740
how do you recommend this I mean what's

468
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,480
your conclusion out of this entire

469
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,940
activity do you feel that one should not

470
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,120
put sensors near the AES operations or

471
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,380
how do you recommend basically to

472
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,660
utilize this okay so I think there are a

473
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,880
couple of take away points from this

474
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,620
work I guess so the first one I think

475
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,380
it's more about the vulnerability of

476
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,419
itself so it's

477
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,600
um it's hard to assume that

478
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,340
um not having physical access means that

479
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,360
it's safe

480
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,640
given that it there could be some other

481
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,380
sensor on chip itself which could

482
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,260
measure it and then uh so in this in the

483
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,419
sense of a weak team it's there are more

484
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,620
things to consider rather than

485
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,500
physically isolating the the targeted

486
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,840
chip and then the other takeaway Point

487
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,159
probably is um

488
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,260
using these kind of sense so of course

489
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,799
blocking sensors makes uh it's not a

490
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,780
very

491
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,100
um I don't think it's the approach

492
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,080
because maybe the sensor these sensors

493
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,900
might have other use cases as well

494
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,280
so um so it's sort of a I think our

495
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,260
intention was to show that there is this

496
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,179
vulnerability and then yeah that's

497
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,039
that's what we were thinking one last

498
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,340
question sorry is uh this sensor 17 was

499
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,380
in red color that means it was not able

500
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,620
to detect the uh key with the help of

501
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,600
that sensor sensor number 17 in the

502
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,000
title yes yeah so which was very near to

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,660
the actual yes yeah design and the

504
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,720
farthest further ones work so

505
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,780
uh in fact it's it's more about the

506
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,260
routing delay so uh how the routing data

507
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,480
itself affects the sensors performance

508
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
so it's more like because all these uh

509
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,640
components they have discrete delay

510
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,280
values right so we can't have sort of

511
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,140
smooth transition so we can't have sort

512
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,700
of a smooth curve it's all sort of like

513
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,059
uh like jaggered sort of uh

514
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,840
changes so what happens is if the delay

515
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,360
doesn't align properly

516
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,179
then it would not work as we expect so

517
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,039
it's because all of these are like

518
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,820
quantized values not like Smooth values

519
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,120
um okay thank you very much uh so we

520
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,940
have the second talk like video while

521
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,340
setting that up there is an announcement

522
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,500
there's a small practical announcement

523
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,480
so the organization found the passport

524
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
of Nam Hoon KU

525
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,419
so I repeat that

526
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,880
if you are this person your passport is

527
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,400
at the registration desk in PDS okay

528
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,039
that's the other Auditorium and if you

529
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,980
know this person please uh tell them to

530
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,440
uh to come pick up their passport thanks

531
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,039
and uh

532
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,840
and I just want to thank all of you uh

533
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,240
for your attention for thoughtful

534
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,380
questions and the slide had some uh some

535
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,080
up so I would like to thank chess

536
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,380
organizers and chess organizers and

537
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,919
sponsors for sponsoring my like yeah

538
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,140
thank you thank you thank you very much

539
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,760
let's thank the speaker again

540
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,780
okay so

541
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,080
um are we ready with the video okay so

542
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,658
I'll just need to presenter its name

543
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,860
I cannot see it on the

544
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,639
Zoom yet probably

545
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,419
yep I am here uh hello

546
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,059
okay

547
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,400
hello uh let's do it from here uh so our

548
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
second talk will be as I say like

549
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,840
recorded it's a pre-m set preventing

550
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,299
magnetic saturation attack on all

551
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,960
sensors it will be uh by anoma darshi

552
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,280
barua so I think we can start a talk and

553
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,679
we can take the questions later hi

554
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,100
everyone I am from UC Irvine

555
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,799
I am going to present one of our works

556
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,380
today our work is related to a defense

557
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,419
methodology for Next Generation Hall

558
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,500
sensors

559
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,020
we name our work as Prime set which has

560
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,940
a full form preventing magnetic

561
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,880
saturation attack on Hall sensors

562
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,220
before going to present our main work I

563
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,720
want to give an outline of this

564
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,460
presentation first

565
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,980
we will start our presentation giving a

566
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,659
journalist view of how sensors

567
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,520
indicating their operational Basics

568
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,919
market growth and vulnerability in

569
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,240
detail

570
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,400
next we will Define the saturation

571
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
attack and motivate you about the

572
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,780
importance of our work by indicating the

573
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,419
lack of work along this direction

574
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,880
after that we will start explaining our

575
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,860
defense Prime set

576
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,320
we'll also present a prototype of our

577
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,480
defense with proper justification and

578
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,799
evolution

579
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
and at the end we will conclude our

580
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,299
presentation indicating the limitations

581
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,799
of articles

582
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,320
now we are going to start by giving the

583
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,320
market growth of all sensors

584
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,960
at the very beginning let's give some

585
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,940
Foundation knowledge on economic growth

586
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,400
of house sensors in today's market

587
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,919
all sensors are so abundant prevalent in

588
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,260
today's sector critical systems all

589
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,539
sensors are everywhere it has been

590
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,700
estimated that house sensors market size

591
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,620
is expected to grow from USD 80

592
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,940
31 million in 2016 to USD

593
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,460
1473 Million by 2023.

594
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,679
we can find Hull sensors in industrial

595
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,320
controllers in Power Systems in

596
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,419
automotive industry and also space

597
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,679
aircrafts

598
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,440
therefore how sensors are pervasive and

599
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
works and ears and eyes of many

600
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
sacrificial systems and therefore the

601
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,740
security of all sensors is really

602
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,600
important

603
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,700
in this slide we will discuss different

604
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,100
components of all sensor basics in

605
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,240
general

606
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,159
we'll start from the whole sensor

607
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,299
physics

608
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,299
as we can see from this figure the main

609
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,220
component of the house sensor is the

610
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,419
whole element

611
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,120
this whole element is typically is a P30

612
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,539
semiconductor a DC voltage bias is

613
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,640
applied across the whole element that

614
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,980
causes a bias current flowing through

615
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,360
the whole element

616
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,299
a magnetic field is also applied on the

617
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,860
whole element in a perpendicular

618
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,080
direction of this bias column

619
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,059
because of this perpendicular presence

620
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,400
of the bias current and magnetic field a

621
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
voltage will be generated across the

622
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,279
whole element

623
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,620
this voltage is known as Hull voltage

624
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,659
the generated Hull voltage is

625
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,520
proportional to the magnetic field

626
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,320
next we will discuss what are the

627
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,240
electronics how sensors have in addition

628
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,919
to a whole element

629
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,320
the output of the whole element is given

630
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,260
to a signal conditional block which has

631
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,240
a differential amplifier

632
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,820
the differential amplifier amplifies the

633
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,919
hall voltage and also removes the common

634
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,380
mode noise from the hall voltage

635
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,620
a regulator is also used to provide

636
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,659
Supply voltage and stable bias current

637
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,360
to the hall sensor

638
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,279
next we discuss the linear and

639
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
saturation region of the hall sensor

640
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,299
using its transfer curve

641
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,460
the output of the differential amplifier

642
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,700
is linear within a certain region

643
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,980
this is known as the linear region of

644
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,120
the sensor

645
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,240
sensors operate in this linear region

646
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,120
the sensor output voltage begin to Flat

647
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,580
when the supply voltage limits are

648
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,720
reached

649
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,059
this flattened region is known as the

650
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,700
saturation region in this saturation

651
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,100
region no information can be recovered

652
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,659
in this slide we'll discuss the

653
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,000
vulnerability of all sensor hardware and

654
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,159
also Define the attack model

655
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,559
as we can see from this figure the main

656
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,480
component of a house sensor is the hall

657
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,860
element

658
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,380
the output from the hall element passes

659
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,799
through differential amplifiers filters

660
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,539
adases and eventually arrives in the

661
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,580
main connective system

662
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,740
it is clear from the discussion that

663
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,539
there is no harness after parallel

664
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,520
present between the sensor and the

665
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
system interface

666
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
therefore this could be an entry point

667
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
of an attacker

668
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,720
a smart attacker can non-invasively

669
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
inject fake external signals into

670
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,179
sensors by using a simple low cost

671
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,860
electromagnet

672
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,260
the injected fake signals can eventually

673
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,779
spook the hull sensor in its linear

674
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,480
region or drive the sensor to its

675
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,159
saturation region

676
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,320
we name this attack as the saturation

677
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,100
attack

678
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,860
in this saturation region no information

679
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,659
can be recovered

680
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,120
and the sensor phases are denial service

681
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,658
effects

682
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,900
we already defined the saturation attack

683
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,480
in the last slide now we are going to

684
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
motivate you about the importance of our

685
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,440
work by indicating the lack of work

686
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,600
along this direction

687
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,760
there have been quite a few works on

688
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,820
sensor defense over last six years

689
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,919
this table indicates the list of those

690
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,120
work

691
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,760
If You observe this table you can see

692
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,659
that

693
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,120
no work exists to prevent a saturation

694
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,640
attack on Hall sensors

695
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,400
people are using different shielding and

696
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
filtering techniques to prevent the

697
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,179
spooking in the linear region

698
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,279
but none of them actually prevent the

699
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,159
sensor from going into the saturation

700
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,919
the reason behind this this filtering

701
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,380
techniques occur as post processing

702
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,260
after the sensor sends the data

703
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,480
therefore if sensor is already in the

704
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,820
saturation no amount of boost producing

705
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,159
after the fact can actually help

706
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
so we need a defense that can work

707
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,779
before the post-processing of the sensor

708
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,940
data

709
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,919
now we are going to discuss how our

710
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,659
defense work against the saturation

711
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,700
actor before the post processing of the

712
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,360
sensor data the main strategy is we will

713
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,279
not allow the whole sensor to go into

714
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,260
its saturation region

715
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,539
the next question comes how will we

716
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,760
ensure that the sound sensor will not go

717
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,039
into a saturation region

718
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,380
we will ensure this by providing the

719
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,419
same amount of internal magnetic field

720
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,760
in opposite polarity to nullify the

721
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,580
injected Peak external magnetic field

722
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,299
this is explained with an animation here

723
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,000
as you see in this animation if we can

724
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,799
provide the same amount of internal

725
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,899
magnetic field to the sensor in right

726
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,840
direction or in appropriate Direction it

727
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,600
can nullify the external fake magnetic

728
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,559
field

729
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,899
this will prevent the sensor from going

730
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,399
into the saturation region

731
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,559
now we explain in which direction we

732
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,720
need to generate that internal magnetic

733
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,640
field to nullify the external fake

734
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,260
magnetic field

735
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,600
we need to remember that not all

736
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,700
component of the external fake magnetic

737
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,820
field can influence the whole sensor

738
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,279
only the vector summation of all the

739
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,140
vertical components of the external fake

740
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,000
Fields can only influence the whole

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,899
sensor this is called by BV external

742
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:49,200
let's explain this with this figure

743
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,779
according to Lawrence pores the hull

744
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,299
voltage is only sensitive to Magnetic

745
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,580
pin B which is perpendicular to bias

746
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,380
current Ibis

747
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,899
therefore if there is one or more

748
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:03,179
multiple magnetic sources are present

749
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,940
for the attack the whole element is only

750
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,640
sensitive to the vector summation of all

751
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
the vertical components of the external

752
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,960
factors which is shown here with the

753
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,679
blinking Arrow

754
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,899
now we know from the previous Slide the

755
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,000
vertical component can influence the

756
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,500
whole sensor

757
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,840
to collect this vertical component from

758
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,360
the external magnetic fields we use a

759
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,220
low resistance circular toroidal

760
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,980
magnetic path made with correct code

761
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,260
and replace the target house sensor

762
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,960
within the gap of the turret

763
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,720
we use a primary coil wrapped on the

764
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,580
same toilet to generate the internal

765
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,799
magnetic field to nullify the vertical

766
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,620
component of the peak external field

767
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,380
this concept is explained here with this

768
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,520
animation

769
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,399
if you notice here the blue one is the

770
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,220
fake external field inside of the turret

771
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,320
and the gray one is the internally

772
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,600
generated magnetic field by the primary

773
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,640
coil which has same strength and in

774
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,279
opposite direction of the blue one

775
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,399
therefore the gray one is nullifying the

776
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,880
blue one inside of the toilet in this

777
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,980
way the external Peak peel can be

778
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,140
nullified to the internal screen using

779
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,880
our defense frame set

780
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,740
the right figure is the physical

781
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,720
implementation of the toilet with the

782
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,380
primary coin

783
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,659
now we explain the different blocks of a

784
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,940
difference in detail the circular

785
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,580
toroidal core is already present or

786
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,679
explained in the last slide

787
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,140
the thyroid also hosts a secondary

788
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,240
sensor to sense the magnetic field

789
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,760
present inside of the toroid

790
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,640
the output from the secondary sensor is

791
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,100
Amplified the noise cancel using a

792
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,600
differential amplifier

793
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,179
next the signal from the differential

794
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,580
amplifier is digitized using an analog

795
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,620
traditional converter and feed into a

796
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,700
CPU

797
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,520
the CPU actually runs an algorithm which

798
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,159
generates a digital signal to nullify

799
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,380
the magnetic field present inside of the

800
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,580
toroid

801
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,460
this digital signal from the CPU is

802
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,039
converted into an analog signal using a

803
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,380
digital Canal converter and speed into

804
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,980
the primary coil using a power buffer

805
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,679
next the primary coil generates the

806
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,659
internal field inside of that array to

807
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,700
nullify the big external field

808
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,980
the Nullification process already is

809
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,840
explained in the last slide in detail

810
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,500
now we discuss the algorithm which runs

811
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,640
on the city

812
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,519
the algorithm is a PID controller

813
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,159
the PID controller takes the fake

814
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,059
external field as the reference signal

815
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:49,019
the kpki and KD constants of the PID

816
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,779
controller are chosen in a way to have

817
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,039
the same response time

818
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,620
the PID controller is implemented in the

819
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,840
Z domain instead of the S domain a

820
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,880
continuous time domain to make the PID

821
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,100
controller more stable and deterministic

822
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,019
with fast response

823
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,239
the output from the theory controller is

824
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,060
converted into an analog signal using a

825
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,580
digital channel converter that is split

826
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,099
into the primary curve

827
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,500
next the generated internal field is

828
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,199
again provided as a feedback to minimize

829
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,000
the error between the external and

830
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,280
internal field

831
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,918
this iteration continues until the

832
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,659
internal field is equal to the external

833
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,119
Peak point with a minimum error

834
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
in this way the PID controller ensures

835
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,339
that the generated internal field has

836
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,500
the same strength as the external fake

837
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500
pin to nullify the external effect in

838
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,760
Click field completely

839
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,699
in this slide to discuss the Prototype

840
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,739
and the test way to evaluate our defense

841
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,940
frame set

842
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,339
we use a strong electromagnet as the

843
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,800
source of the external Peak field

844
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,160
a manganese drink software it is used as

845
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,500
a storage core in our prototype

846
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
we also use a low power oven as for the

847
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,420
differential amplifier

848
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,300
and efm32 giant gecko development board

849
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,940
from Silicon lab is also used as a CPU

850
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,280
to run the PID control algorithm for our

851
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,900
defense

852
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,540
we use an Arduino board to control the

853
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,520
external thick magnetic field generated

854
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,260
by the strong electromagnet in our

855
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,700
testbed

856
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,400
and an antenna is also used to inject

857
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,619
Emi interference into the prototype in

858
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,920
our testbed

859
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,359
in this slide we'll justify the

860
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,220
effectiveness of a defense frame set

861
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,380
against the saturation method

862
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,839
the first figure is the output from the

863
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,540
hull sensor before any attack happens

864
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,520
and the second figure is the output

865
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,619
after an attack happens

866
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,839
you can see that the output of the

867
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,300
target house sensor is driving to its

868
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,640
saturation voltage close to 4.8 volt

869
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,920
after the saturation happens which

870
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,040
results are flattened output signal

871
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,619
next we integrate our defense Prime set

872
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,420
with the whole sensor

873
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,180
the output signal after the attack when

874
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,280
you use print set is shown in this third

875
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,440
field

876
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,380
next we measure that similarity between

877
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,599
the output signal before the attack and

878
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:20,700
after data when our defense is present

879
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,339
using the correlation coefficient

880
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,680
we find that the correlation coefficient

881
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,380
between these two signal is close to 1.

882
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,720
this indicates that the output signal is

883
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,060
not parted even after the attack when we

884
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,680
use or defense

885
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,560
this gives justification of a proposed

886
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,119
defense against the saturation effect

887
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,859
this slide present a result after

888
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,960
evaluating the defense pen set with 10

889
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,520
different house sensors from four

890
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,140
different manufacturers

891
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,420
we tested frame set within the entire

892
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,040
frequency range of 10 different house

893
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,740
sensors you can see the similarity or

894
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,540
the correlation coefficient is close to

895
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,760
1 when we use a difference

896
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,980
this proves that our defense frame set

897
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,079
Works within the entire frequency range

898
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,060
of the whole sensors

899
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,099
next we test our defense frame set

900
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,720
against different strength of the

901
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,540
external fake magnetic fields you can

902
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,780
see your defense works up to 4200 ampere

903
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,940
turns which is really a strong field and

904
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,800
maintain a correlation coefficient close

905
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,420
to one

906
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,400
as we tested our defense for 10

907
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,440
different house sensors we can say that

908
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,060
our defense is quite General to the

909
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,640
whole sensor

910
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,619
now we are going to compare our defense

911
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,660
with a ferromagnetic Shield this will

912
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,460
answer the question whether a defense is

913
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,859
better than shielding we know that the

914
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,119
increase of The Shield thickness

915
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,180
provides better shielding therefore we

916
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,579
vary The Shield thickness from 0.3 inch

917
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,560
to 1 inch and measure the correlation

918
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,560
coefficient for every sensor we can see

919
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,540
that even one inch Shield cannot prevent

920
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,940
a strong magnetic field it is evident

921
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,200
from the value of the correlation

922
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,420
coefficient which are less than 0.5

923
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,180
because Shields get saturated at high

924
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,980
magnetic field therefore its shielding

925
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,260
property gets diminished

926
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,440
next when we use pen set only we can see

927
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,119
that that correlation coefficient is

928
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,000
close to 1. this indicates that Prime

929
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,020
set is more effective than ashamed

930
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,760
now we discuss on the limitations of a

931
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,099
defense temp set this limitations exist

932
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,900
because of the Practical limitation of

933
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,640
the hardware not for the design method

934
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,700
allows you preset consumes 0 to 3 watt

935
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,020
power while generating the strong

936
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,300
magnetic field this power consumption

937
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,579
may be small for power some applications

938
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,500
such as solar inverters that may be

939
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,300
substantial for few applications such as

940
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,240
proximity sensing non-zero settling time

941
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,700
of 23 micro second of the PID controller

942
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,200
contributes to the real-time requirement

943
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,060
of the defense therefore if the attacker

944
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,980
changes the impacted magnetic fields

945
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,560
within 23 microsecond the timeliness of

946
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,480
the difference may not be connected

947
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,520
in spite of the fine tuning the theater

948
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,140
controller has a non-zero statistic

949
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,060
error which may add small error to the

950
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,619
internal field while nullifying the

951
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,300
external field

952
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,820
our prototype can prevent an external

953
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,700
magnetic field up to an MMF of 4200

954
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,619
ampere turns this limit can be

955
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,960
critically increased to end to any value

956
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,000
using a stronger buffer

957
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,280
our prototype can also prevent external

958
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,640
magnetic field up to a frequency of

959
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,859
30 kilohertz this upper limit results

960
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,780
from the total time required to generate

961
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,940
the internal magnetic field this time

962
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,339
can reduce further using a faster CPU

963
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,380
having a clock frequency higher than 48

964
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,000
megahertz

965
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,040
we are close to the end of our

966
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,960
presentation now we provide a summary of

967
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,640
our work we introduce the saturation

968
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,680
attack model and lack of work along this

969
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,880
direction

970
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,680
we provide a defense against the

971
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,900
saturation attack by Hall sensors we

972
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,820
also provide a prototype justification

973
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,460
and evaluation of our defense and last

974
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,800
we also provide limitations of the

975
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,480
defense

976
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,359
yep that's all for today thank you very

977
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,040
much for your patience and time to

978
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,500
listen our work I am happy to answer any

979
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,440
question if you have

980
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,200
we thank the speaker for the

981
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
presentation

982
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,180
thank you you have one of darshi on Zoom

983
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,339
site so in case you have any questions

984
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,960
please feel free to ask can you hear

985
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,680
ushi yeah I can hear you okay that's

986
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,720
great so far I haven't seen any

987
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,320
questions on the zoom side I'll just

988
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,820
double check

989
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,560
any questions from the audience

990
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,839
I cannot see any

991
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,300
um I may have one question regarding the

992
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,940
limitations you mentioned so about the

993
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,960
publish

994
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,440
in the last I think it was the the slide

995
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,920
before the last one yep you investigate

996
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,020
anything or have you investigated

997
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,940
anything

998
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,420
uh to deal with that or would you just

999
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,599
accept it as it is

1000
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,780
so the numbers the zero to three over

1001
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,320
power consumption like uh actually the

1002
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,540
three word that is the extreme scenario

1003
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,700
so for example the power consumption

1004
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,099
hole probably depends upon the how much

1005
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,579
uh magnetic field that other is exerting

1006
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,099
into the sensor so the three watt power

1007
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,040
is the extreme condition so normally the

1008
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,200
attacker actually can generate that type

1009
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,880
of that amount of power in a practical

1010
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,040
scenario

1011
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,800
uh so normally the amount of power the

1012
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,780
attacker can generate by using the Emi

1013
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,060
or electromagnet is closely range less

1014
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,700
than one Watt that type of power is

1015
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,300
actually visible for solar inverters or

1016
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,700
the autonomous or the or the industrial

1017
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,160
controllers like the power is not an

1018
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,420
issue actually

1019
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,640
but for a few applications like the

1020
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,920
proximity sensing where the low power is

1021
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,079
actually used maybe the one what could

1022
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,700
be critical

1023
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,220
uh so one way to actually reduce this

1024
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,760
power is actually omit that power buffer

1025
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,280
thing because that is the most uh most

1026
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,320
power hungry device that actually

1027
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,119
consuming the high power

1028
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,940
so if we remove the power buffer we can

1029
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,579
actually somehow reduce the power

1030
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,900
consumption for the current scenario but

1031
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,480
if we reduce the power buffer like there

1032
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,180
one problem could occur is that like the

1033
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,099
primary coil actually cannot generate

1034
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,140
enough power to

1035
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,619
counter effect the uh exerting magnetic

1036
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,320
field so it's actually a Trader like uh

1037
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,260
how much power we actually spend or how

1038
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,420
much magnetic field we actually counter

1039
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,700
we actually now depend there is some

1040
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,520
kind of trade-off actually

1041
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,760
okay thank you very much

1042
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,079
um

1043
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,000
I think we don't have any questions and

1044
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,640
we anyways have to switch to the next

1045
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,680
talk thank you very much for your

1046
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,480
presentation let's thank the speaker

1047
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,839
again

1048
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,420
so

1049
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,119
I would just get to him to talk again

1050
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,660
okay

1051
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,119
so we again have uh Brian

1052
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,119
for the last Talk of the session a power

1053
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,240
to pass with a password modulation

1054
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,599
sensor for remote power analysis attacks

1055
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,140
so

1056
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,939
thank you

1057
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,819
um yeah so in this talk we are going to

1058
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,680
look at uh

1059
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,660
power to pulse with modulation sensor or

1060
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,020
ppwm it's a self-calibrating on chip

1061
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,760
sensor that's designed for remote power

1062
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,300
analysis attacks on fpgas

1063
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,040
so in the previous talk we looked at

1064
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,560
what on chip power sensors are and we

1065
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,940
looked at what remote permanent analysis

1066
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,200
attacks are

1067
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,140
and in this talk we are going to look at

1068
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,780
few design insights to design for

1069
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,599
Designing better RPS sensors

1070
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,460
and then we are going to look at the

1071
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,160
architecture of the proposed ppwm sensor

1072
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,660
and then we are going to see some

1073
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,819
performance evaluations of the ppwm

1074
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,140
sensor

1075
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,839
so the design insights first of all we

1076
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:19,980
are going to look at the sensor

1077
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,680
resolution and so we are motivated so

1078
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,839
for this we were motivated by the sense

1079
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:27,480
output of VT in fact VT had a lower

1080
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
resolution compared to then existing

1081
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,920
sensors but its performance was no worse

1082
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,540
than them

1083
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,480
so what we did for because of that what

1084
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,160
we did was we synthesized a set of power

1085
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,920
traces with eight level resolution and

1086
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,200
we added white gaussian noise to

1087
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,359
simulate a real world scenario or a real

1088
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,240
world on chip sensor and the outputs we

1089
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,180
had them in the range of 0 to 7. and we

1090
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,060
use uh data binning to bin them into

1091
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,160
different number of so just to reduce

1092
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,339
the resolution we did data being so

1093
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,619
we had the original traces as it is with

1094
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,040
eight bins and then

1095
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,619
we combine few beans together to get six

1096
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,440
beans and then we pairwise bin them so

1097
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,599
we have four bins and then we split them

1098
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,680
into

1099
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,260
two halves so we got two bins

1100
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,119
and um

1101
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,339
then using those places we performed

1102
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,460
remote par analysis attacks and this is

1103
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,180
how the result looked like so here what

1104
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,180
the plot but it's what it shows is uh so

1105
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,099
we have overlaid

1106
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,380
we are the attacks were successful with

1107
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,819
eight beans on top of that we have

1108
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,680
overlaid the places where we were able

1109
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,680
to attack with six beans four beans and

1110
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,780
two beans so and then our

1111
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,640
y-axis top to bottom we have increased

1112
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,220
the noise in log scale and x axis again

1113
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,380
we have increased the noise in log scale

1114
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,500
sorry we have uh Power traces increasing

1115
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,060
in the log scale

1116
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,940
so you can see at a glance that the

1117
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,280
place almost all the circles we where

1118
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,579
this the lighter color circle is you can

1119
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:08,220
see the darker dot so which sort of

1120
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,200
means that

1121
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,460
um

1122
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,319
the number of beans doesn't matter

1123
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,720
because with eight beans almost all the

1124
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,160
places where you could attack with eight

1125
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,079
bins you could attack with two beans as

1126
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:19,859
well

1127
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,800
so um

1128
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,839
in the in a way what that means is like

1129
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,339
the attack efficacy is not compromised

1130
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,640
by lowering the resolution so we could

1131
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,800
make a two level sensor which actually

1132
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,480
which means like there's only two beans

1133
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,220
we could make such a sensor and that

1134
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,319
should be sufficient for remote par

1135
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,859
analysis attacks and why we could why

1136
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,140
why such a motivation because with two

1137
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,060
level sensor we could possibly lower the

1138
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,680
resource requirement of the sensor

1139
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,359
because it's smaller

1140
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,960
and given that it's just two levels it

1141
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,599
just uh the information is just one bit

1142
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,540
and therefore the bandwidth requirement

1143
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,240
is lesser if you want to transfer the

1144
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,920
trace from the sensor to attack setup

1145
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,200
the Randy requirement would be lesser

1146
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,900
and given that we could make it smaller

1147
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,160
we could make it stealthier when

1148
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,380
compared to Bulky sensors

1149
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,560
so next we are going to look at uh the

1150
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,960
impact of the threshold value so what I

1151
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,700
mean by threshold value is where we

1152
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,339
should split these eight levels into the

1153
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,680
two into two beans which place we should

1154
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,140
do that being

1155
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,819
so for that we investigated the ideal

1156
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,180
threshold value so we tried splitting it

1157
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,960
between 0 and 1 so 0 goes to one bin and

1158
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,440
the rest goes to another bin so we tried

1159
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,300
changing the changing the bins to

1160
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,619
different values

1161
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,260
so we cried all the way up to seven so

1162
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,260
we had eight different uh Bean

1163
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,640
configurations

1164
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,400
and so we used those Bean traces to

1165
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,220
perform RPI attacks and this is how the

1166
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,619
results looks like for that so again in

1167
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:59,520
this plot what I have shown here is

1168
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,660
um

1169
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,339
we have

1170
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:05,700
um so this purple dot it's it's showing

1171
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,700
the thresholding happening at zero and

1172
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,099
then on top of that we have overlaid uh

1173
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,859
different places that be threshold

1174
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,859
and again like in the previous plot we

1175
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,380
have y-axis noise increasing in log

1176
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,359
scale from top to bottom and x axis

1177
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,280
number of power traces increasing in log

1178
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,900
scale from left to right

1179
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,420
and so again here you can see at a

1180
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,520
glance that uh

1181
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,760
the dark dots are not as widespread as

1182
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,900
the lighter one so you can see more the

1183
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,420
lighter ones are widespread more

1184
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,160
widespread compared to the darker ones

1185
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,440
so if you look at specifically this a

1186
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,520
square

1187
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,680
It's At a Glance you can see it's darker

1188
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,319
when compared to the other which is

1189
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:52,319
because you can see these edge cases uh

1190
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,520
in that square

1191
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,700
but if you look at B we we can't

1192
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,160
we don't have this the darker the

1193
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,859
outermost ones so in the sense we were

1194
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,980
only able to attack with if we were

1195
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,020
splitting it in the middle

1196
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,359
and then C it's the lightest which means

1197
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,880
none of these darker ones exist so we

1198
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,859
were able to attack only with the

1199
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,460
innermost uh thresholding values so

1200
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,760
essentially we would have a thresholding

1201
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,619
between two and three three and four

1202
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,140
four and five here

1203
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,079
and uh so that's where where we would

1204
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,640
like to have the thresholding happening

1205
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,500
with the sensor

1206
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,060
so um

1207
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,680
the takeaway point is so the attack

1208
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,839
efficacy is significantly reliant on the

1209
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,160
thresholding value

1210
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,099
and incorrect threshold value in this so

1211
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:43,920
it actually causes a significant uh

1212
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,220
performance degradation and uh

1213
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,560
then so income when compared to the

1214
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,359
sensor resolution we just discussed a

1215
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,400
while ago threshold value actually

1216
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,040
matters so it's actually important to

1217
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,480
make sure that we threshold it at the

1218
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,800
correct point

1219
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,079
and so with those things in mind let's

1220
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,060
have a look at the architecture of ppwm

1221
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,900
so this is how the sensor design of ppwm

1222
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,040
looks like and the key components are as

1223
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,319
the ones that are shown here

1224
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,420
so um

1225
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,300
we are using EXO gates in this design so

1226
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,220
EXO gets the key property that we are

1227
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,500
going to utilize here is that EXO Gates

1228
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,359
would give us a one when the inputs are

1229
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:25,319
different

1230
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,599
so um

1231
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,599
for the moment let's assume the sensor

1232
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,420
is stable and the clock is zero so all

1233
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,960
the points all the Junctions in the

1234
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,900
sensor are they are settled to the zero

1235
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,940
logic zero and

1236
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,980
we for for the moment we'll just worry

1237
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,960
about this part because the rest it's

1238
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,540
pretty simple similar to the the part

1239
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,859
that we are going to discuss

1240
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:52,980
so when the clock Rises what happens is

1241
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,800
this would become a one and immediately

1242
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,540
these two points will become once

1243
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,059
because it's just a straight wire

1244
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,240
then now uh unlike in the previous case

1245
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,680
where this was Zero

1246
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,440
the EXO Gate C is two different values

1247
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,180
in its inputs so

1248
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,319
what that makes what that does is that

1249
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,359
the EXO gate would output a one because

1250
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,640
the inputs are different now and after

1251
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,440
the signal propagates through this

1252
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,660
buffer

1253
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,400
this input of the xor gate would be

1254
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,980
gamma 1. so now again the EXO gate would

1255
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,440
have the same inputs which would cause

1256
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,619
this to become a zero

1257
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:33,540
so um if you look at it again what

1258
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,180
happens is when the clock rises from 0

1259
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,119
to 1 we would have a pulse generating at

1260
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,880
the EXO gate output

1261
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,339
so um

1262
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,859
we know that as I discussed in the

1263
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,020
previous uh presentation as well so the

1264
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,540
power consumption is uh proportional to

1265
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,819
the signal propagation DeLay So What

1266
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,800
happens when the power consumption is

1267
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,540
low is that it would

1268
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,540
cause less delay on propagating the

1269
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,880
signal along the buffer so it would

1270
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,040
quickly propagate therefore we would

1271
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,740
have a narrow pulse occurring at the end

1272
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,680
of this EXO gate but when the power

1273
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,780
consumption is high it would cause

1274
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,579
higher propagation delay so it takes

1275
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,740
time to proceed the times to the signal

1276
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,220
to propagate so the result would be that

1277
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,960
the EXO gate would generate a wider

1278
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,400
pulse because it the signals were

1279
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,640
different for a longer period of time

1280
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,020
so now

1281
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,099
um

1282
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,339
the so the the Blue Gate network is the

1283
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,020
one that we discussed so we see that the

1284
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,780
red one it's identical to the this the

1285
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,380
Blue Gate network but in addition to uh

1286
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,119
in addition we got an ideal element

1287
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,160
connected to that

1288
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,619
so ideally element it's the same thing

1289
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:47,640
that I discussed in the previous

1290
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,900
presentation it's more like a volume

1291
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,359
slider but in this case what happens is

1292
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,920
when you slide the the delay we could we

1293
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,140
could uh offset where these policies

1294
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,960
appearing so we could use that to sort

1295
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,500
of slide where the pulses appearing and

1296
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
um

1297
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,740
then we have an N then we have an n gate

1298
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,040
which is driven by these two uh

1299
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,780
waveforms

1300
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,660
so and gate it would output a one when

1301
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,880
both the inputs are one so when the

1302
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,400
signals are aligned we would see that we

1303
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,740
we should be getting almost almost

1304
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,339
identical pulse but if we use this ideal

1305
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,140
element and shift the value what happens

1306
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,599
is we can control the width of that

1307
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,940
pulse appearing at the end of this and

1308
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,619
gate

1309
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,859
and then what we do is we use this and

1310
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,859
gate output to drive the clear input of

1311
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,720
a flip flop

1312
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,420
and the flip flop is constantly fed with

1313
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,520
one so we use that to drive the clear

1314
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,819
input so

1315
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:56,040
and all the signals they they need to be

1316
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,500
held for a certain period of time for

1317
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,260
the effect to get uh for for its effect

1318
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,800
to get uh actually affected so if we

1319
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,940
have

1320
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,740
um if we have the

1321
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,140
um so if you have the um

1322
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,740
ideally value at a certain if you use it

1323
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,660
at certain point regardless the power

1324
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,180
consumption we can see that this

1325
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,880
waveform satisfies the minimum time that

1326
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,119
the clear input request so regardless

1327
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,920
what the power consumption is it would

1328
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,500
always clear the flip flop but if we

1329
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,260
switch it if it move it a little bit you

1330
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,480
can see that the pulse width gets

1331
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,000
narrowed but still regardless the power

1332
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,280
consumption you can see like it when the

1333
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,720
power consumption changes the weight

1334
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,460
changes but still it satisfies the

1335
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,660
minimum time required for the clear

1336
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,900
input so no matter what it is it would

1337
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,280
still clear the flip flop but if you

1338
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,680
move it a bit further you can see that

1339
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,400
in some cases it satisfies the minimum

1340
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,960
time required for the clear input but in

1341
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,339
some cases it's narrower than the

1342
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,900
minimum time required so it's not

1343
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,700
satisfying that requirement so it's not

1344
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,680
going to clear the flip flop

1345
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,440
so when the power consumption is low we

1346
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,140
saw that the pulse width is narrower so

1347
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,420
with for a given ideally a setting let's

1348
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,180
see let's assume that it gives us this

1349
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,800
sort of waveform so it's not going to

1350
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,660
satisfy the minimum time required for

1351
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,240
the clean input to get affected so as a

1352
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,880
result we should be seeing a one at the

1353
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,500
flip flop output because the clear

1354
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,720
signal is not affecting and we should

1355
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,400
see the data reflecting at the queue

1356
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,420
output

1357
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,000
but if the power consumption is high

1358
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,800
for the same idelay setting we would

1359
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
have a wider pulse

1360
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,140
and what happens is so it should no

1361
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,359
matter what the data value is it should

1362
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,119
clear the free flow so we should see a

1363
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,940
zero at its output

1364
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,440
so um

1365
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,800
that's the core part of ppwm and then we

1366
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,780
have few more components to assist with

1367
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,339
functioning so

1368
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:58,920
uh this control FSM it's basically the

1369
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,300
one that determines whether we should

1370
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,640
adjust the idelay or not and then we

1371
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,319
have a memory to store this flip flop

1372
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,240
output

1373
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,720
and few performance evaluations of ppwm

1374
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,540
so we checked the impact of the AES

1375
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,240
module the frequency of the as module so

1376
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,880
we place the ppwm sensor there and the

1377
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,680
as module here and then we varied the

1378
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,300
frequency of the as module

1379
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,520
and um

1380
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,740
so the results looks like this

1381
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,180
so you can see that the perform the key

1382
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,000
rank variation it's sort of encapsulated

1383
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,520
within an arrow envelope oops

1384
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,099
uh

1385
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:41,220
so specifically you can see that the

1386
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,740
sampling frequency to the AES frequency

1387
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,260
seems to be not that relevant because

1388
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,839
the sum we have varied the frequency in

1389
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,000
a quite a wide range but the performance

1390
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,579
field looks the same sort of and then

1391
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:56,160
specifically the spread waveform the set

1392
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,400
the red variation the a is

1393
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,280
was running at 96 megahertz and the

1394
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,260
sampling was done at 96 megahertz in the

1395
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,579
sense both were running at the same

1396
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,800
frequency and still be able to attack

1397
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,839
the as modules

1398
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,819
and uh we checked the cloud

1399
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,640
deployability and portability of uh ppw

1400
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,980
for that we used Amazon ec2 AWS instance

1401
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,500
so to check portability we actually

1402
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,900
deployed the experiment setup

1403
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,500
concurrently in two different instances

1404
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,460
and so these mod these I find instances

1405
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,440
they got new silence Ultra scale plus

1406
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,079
fpgs and we use these frequency settings

1407
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,839
so we used the sensor 200 megahertz and

1408
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,119
the victim areas at 10 megahertz and

1409
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:45,240
this is how the key rank varies

1410
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,540
and so as you can see that in both the

1411
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,960
experiment setups uh the efficacy was

1412
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,500
pretty similar and the conclusion is

1413
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,119
that we can

1414
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,640
an attacker could use

1415
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,480
a different instance to design and test

1416
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,859
and

1417
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,020
a sensor and then deploy it along with a

1418
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,900
victim and expect any identical

1419
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,040
performance on that uh setup as well

1420
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,079
also we did some comparison with

1421
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,300
existing sensors so we compare ring

1422
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:24,740
oscillators tdcs and VT and ppwm and

1423
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,240
for ring oscillators we use 64 instances

1424
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,160
but for other sensors we just use one of

1425
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,880
them

1426
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,200
and we use same frequencies for all the

1427
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,299
test setups

1428
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,760
and this is how the performance varied

1429
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,859
so um

1430
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:42,540
we can see that for the given

1431
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,359
configuration ppwm outperformed all the

1432
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,720
other sensors but we can consider them

1433
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,359
to be of comparable to efficacy because

1434
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,520
with a small change in the routing delay

1435
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,579
this could actually change

1436
00:58:56,579 --> 00:58:59,640
um how long it takes to recover the key

1437
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,400
so it um in a way we can consider them

1438
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,500
to be of comparable efficacy but with

1439
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,900
our recalibration mechanism we have made

1440
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,000
sure sort of uh

1441
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,500
the

1442
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,680
key of the thresholding point of the

1443
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,760
routing delay impact would be minimal

1444
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,859
so in addition to those results

1445
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,660
presented we experimentally evaluated

1446
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,420
the effects of the placement of both the

1447
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,819
as module and the ppwm sensor and then

1448
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:28,859
we check the impact of the temperature

1449
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:29,880
change

1450
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,640
and we experimentally evaluated few

1451
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,819
properties uh specifically the bandwidth

1452
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:37,559
requirement of the sensor

1453
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,319
and for more results and information

1454
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,660
kindly refer to our paper and we have

1455
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,359
submitted design sources and Sample data

1456
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,680
sets as artifacts and they have been

1457
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,079
accepted so I think they should be

1458
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:51,059
available with ISR soon

1459
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,920
and if anybody needs them up front

1460
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,319
please do email us we can send them uh

1461
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:57,960
if you want to do uh before they become

1462
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,880
available through is here

1463
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,180
so in this talk in uh we looked at the

1464
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,799
impact of the sensor resolution on RP

1465
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,079
attacks the impact of threshold value 1

1466
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,660
RP attacks and then we looked at the

1467
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,480
architecture of the proposed ppwm sensor

1468
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,480
and its performance and properties

1469
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,240
and it's time for your questions thank

1470
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,439
you very much for the talk

1471
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:28,319
any questions from the audience

1472
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,200
I haven't seen anything so far on Zoom

1473
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,040
let me double check

1474
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:38,460
there is one meanwhile for the audience

1475
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,079
um

1476
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:41,760
the the new sensor that you introduced

1477
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,900
yeah

1478
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,420
what was its characteristics to the

1479
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,339
temperature changes if you have done

1480
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:50,400
that oh yeah so we have them in the

1481
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,859
um in our paper so given that it's

1482
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,380
almost the results so we picked few for

1483
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,540
the ppwm when we picked

1484
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,119
remaining set for VT so just so that

1485
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,920
they are they're sort of

1486
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,140
um so you can get some idea because it's

1487
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,119
we didn't choose the same to show

1488
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,460
because it would look like the same so

1489
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,780
you can actually go through the paper

1490
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,520
and we we have the results there which

1491
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,700
one is

1492
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,700
more uh

1493
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,660
uh I would say it's um of course we

1494
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,760
um the performance of course for the

1495
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,260
tested conditions they were pretty

1496
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,240
similar

1497
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,020
um

1498
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,119
I think we should we should properly do

1499
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,559
an experiment and conclude something

1500
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,420
like that it's a bit hard to conclude

1501
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,180
with that new architecture this one ppwm

1502
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,799
would be less resilient to temperature

1503
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:40,559
than the the previous one because you

1504
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,960
might increase the resolution of your

1505
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,859
measurement by adding so many

1506
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:50,040
um and gate structures as compared to in

1507
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,140
this where your uh there's only one

1508
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,420
point that the one I would delay only

1509
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,160
basically

1510
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,540
uh

1511
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,780
I suspect that though but the thing is

1512
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,880
by recalibrating what I do is basically

1513
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,760
I change the the i o delay setting so

1514
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,559
it's the same IU delay setting change

1515
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:10,200
happening on both the sensors the only

1516
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,540
thing which I could think why BT would

1517
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,520
work better is there are

1518
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,799
four more place like three more places

1519
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,200
where we could we could have

1520
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,879
the change trapped

1521
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,119
any other questions

1522
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,500
anyways we're

1523
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,380
quite out of time actually is there any

1524
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:38,099
do you see oops yes so um to get to the

1525
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,319
PDS as quickly as possible we will go

1526
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,940
via these doors to make okay so now we

1527
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,579
conclude our session here and also the

1528
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,440
last sessions of Chess thank you very

1529
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,299
much for attending let's thank the

1530
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:53,839
speaker again

1531
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,339
and

1532
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:59,339
um as they said you can use these doors

1533
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:03,500
to reach PDS again thank you
