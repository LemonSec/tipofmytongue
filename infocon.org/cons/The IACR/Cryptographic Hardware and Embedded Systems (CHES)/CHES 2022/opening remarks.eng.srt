19
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,780
bit more involved than um a regular

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,840

there's no single bed left

37
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,959
in this town There's no single bed left

38
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,000
in a circle 10 kilometers around this

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,940
town next free bread is a bed is in

40
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,359
Brussels

41
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,099
so sorry for that we warned you we had

42
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,239
it written on the website we had it

43
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,739
written on Twitter

44
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,660
book early at least your your

45
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,819
accommodation

46
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,540
so well done

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,040
next of course yeah we have to speak

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,300
about covet

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,940
I guess by now everybody should be

50
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,360
familiar with how to deal with it

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,040
nevertheless so we have a few things to

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,940
say

53
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,860
currently there are no official

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,659
restrictions

55
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,459
by

56
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,180
the Belgian state or by this University

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,159
so we don't have to wear masks we don't

58
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,659
have to disinfect the hands all the time

59
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,060
and so on of course these things are

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,860
still recommended

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,519
right so be sensible right we have

62
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,580
if everybody comes we have 515 people

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,680
from all over the world

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,540
right I mean we don't want to be like

65
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,519
you know the super spreader event

66
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,620
of the millennium

67
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,040
masked are not obligated but are

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
recommended if you want to wear a mask

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
and you don't have one we have some at

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,440
the at the registration desk for you you

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,000
can go and ask for one we'll give you

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
one

73
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,599
if you feel any kind of symptoms please

74
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,459
test yourself it doesn't cost you

75
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,959
anything we have tests again at the

76
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,299
registration desk yeah

77
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,879
um it takes it takes 30 seconds swap

78
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,879
swap and done right if in case of doubt

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,940
it's better to check right if the test

80
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,199
is positive

81
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,760
don't come to us right

82
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,960
so

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,060
isolate yourself send us an email and

84
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,620
we'll tell you where you have to go to

85
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,199
do a PCR test and then and we take it

86
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
from there okay

87
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,780
so

88
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,860
you know when you buy a house location

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,139
location is everything it's the same for

90
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,880
Jess

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,220
um so just grew too much so we have two

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,259
locations this year we couldn't fit

93
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,540
everything into the single place

94
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,580
so the people who are here in the room

95
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,820
with us you are in Peter the zamaola

96
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,460
okay roughly five minutes walk from here

97
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,080
is the second location which is called

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,580
grow taola

99
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,800
and it's really like a copy and paste so

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,419
there's a there's an auditorium like

101
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,500
this one

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,600
there's a coffee break area there are

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,759
sponsors over there everything okay so

104
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,400
it's it's a complete secondary copy of

105
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,758
this thing

106
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,500
the program chairs kind of made sure

107
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,540
that it doesn't matter in which topics

108
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,340
you're interested you will always have

109
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,919
to switch between these locations every

110
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:23,820
day

111
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,400
yeah so all everybody gets to see all

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,020
sponsors everybody gets to see all

113
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,259
locations and so on that's the idea

114
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,300
um

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,220
there's Steve Williams those who came to

116
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,139
the reception yesterday evening you know

117
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,820
it you've been there

118
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,139
the other ones we'll find out today

119
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,660
where it is

120
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,240
we have um we have once more glitch in

121
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,979
the program

122
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,539
um because yeah so when we plan this

123
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,680
thing we had to move a lot of stones

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,780
around because it was very late that we

125
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,580
started planning it and so on

126
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,139
because chess was supposed to be in

127
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,240
Beijing

128
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,639
um one rock that we couldn't move was

129
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,979
director of this University

130
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,259
Vice Rector sorry

131
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:04,860
um

132
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,419
so on Wednesday afternoon there's one

133
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,060
session that should be here but the vice

134
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
Vector is going to be here

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,300
and so for this one session we're going

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,160
to be somewhere else that's right after

137
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,139
lunch on Wednesday and we will just

138
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,699
guide you to that other location there

139
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,860
are no signs there's nothing it's just

140
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,319
when Wednesday after lunch don't Auto

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,120
magically run here

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,460
Wednesday after lunch wait for us and

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,620
we'll bring everybody in a group to that

144
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,240
other location it's just one session the

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,860
coffee break afterwards is already back

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,699
here it's really just one session

147
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,979
yeah and so lunches

148
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,560
and today in the evening the walking

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,380
dinner will be in the U Williams are

150
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,660
which is yeah roughly seven minutes from

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,120
here or two three minutes from the other

152
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,419
location

153
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,199
another important location is this one

154
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,039
it's called

155
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,699
that's important for Tuesday evening

156
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,759
that's where the Bankhead will be

157
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,699
it's it's on the Ring of leuven

158
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,979
so it's roughly a 15 minutes walk from

159
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,159
here

160
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,240
we think it's best if you know if you

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,740
just put it into your phone Google Maps

162
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,520
whatever

163
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,340
and you go there by yourself

164
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,960
if you're unsure if you don't have a

165
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,940
phone whatever

166
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,479
we will walk from here at 6 15 Sharp

167
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,220
so if you if you want to walk with us

168
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,919
that's fine then be here before 8 16 8

169
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,919
16 we start working yeah but yeah it's

170
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,419
probably not smart that we start working

171
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,819
