I'm sorry I missed your referencing me

4
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,038
because I'm too busy writing a report

5
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,140
and everyone apparently you said my name

6
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,220
everyone looked at me and I was just

7
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,080

someone don't do it here come here

12
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,879

13
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,220
a picture holds back in front of that

14

18
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,920
people are not stupid

19
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,640

now okay

53
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,539
okay okay it seems that you need to hear

54
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,400
loud sound yeah

55
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,259

00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,160
ceremony just 2022 yeah

57
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,680
I have to say that this is the first

58
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,960
time that we have this ceremony in

59
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,500
present no we had the chess a test of

60
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,699
time award uh since uh 2020 and it was

61
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,740
of course during the pandemy and an

62
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,139
entire ceremony was just online and

63
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,900
virtual and I'm very glad that we have

64
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,479
this time at this in presence and the

65
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,760
authorities actually are here Ah that's

66
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,620
very nice

67
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,899
um tell you a story probably not all of

68
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,120
you are informed about this and how this

69
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,140
works

70
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,080
um it's actually the idea is to give

71
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,540
this this a bar to a paper with lasting

72
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,820
impact in the field with respect to

73
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,800
Academia industry

74
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
um how it's used by the other people how

75
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,899
let's say many many times cited how it

76
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,240
changed the field whether it was seen

77
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,820
very um impactful by the industry or not

78
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,180
yeah and and the idea is to select a

79
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,000
paper from chess or teachers you know of

80
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,140
course at that time we didn't have

81
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,240
teachers yet but just

82
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
um at the year of X I mean X is for this

83
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,060
year 2022 minus 21 to minus 20 minus 19

84
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,200
means that from chess

85
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,080
2001 till chest 2003 you know a paper

86
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,140
for three years wow and Alia is to

87
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,240
select one of those papers and also give

88
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,880
this award to um The Archers and ask

89
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,640
them to also present the paper not

90
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,440
really completely technical but for

91
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,420
example the story behind the paper which

92
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,560
is made

93
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,660
and of course the process is like this

94
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,060
that anybody or anyone is able to

95
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,339
nominate and there is a deadline for

96
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,480
that and if you are not available

97
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
um it's also a yearly um process and

98
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,600
it's um the committee is also rotating

99
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,300
every year and two members are appointed

100
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,300
by their student committee and these two

101
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,000
paper these two members invite three

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,820
other members and usually these three

103
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,279
invited members are from the program

104
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,399
committee or program shares of those

105
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,279
chess you know it means that chess 2001

106
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,220
till chest 2003 usually it should not be

107
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,079
or it must not be what is usually the

108
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,240
case and also we usually try to have

109
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,160
someone from the industry to have also

110
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
their their opinion and idea from the

111
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,640
industry

112
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
yeah and then what happened

113
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,620
um Ingrid um verbal weather and also

114
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,320
myself were two members appointed by the

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
steering committee and I chaired this

116
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,519
process I mean sure doesn't mean that I

117
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,860
had any particular vote no it means that

118
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,779
that's just the organization yeah just

119
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,459
make it clear

120
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,940
um and then we invited um who is also

121
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,540
here very thankful for his dedication to

122
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,420
this and he was the PC member of Chess

123
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,760
2003 and at the same time he was the

124
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,160
awardee of the last year yeah if you

125
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,100
have uh attended a chess last year of

126
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
course ritual you have seen that he

127
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
received an award for the chess uh test

128
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,660
of time 2021 and then also okay um the

129
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,740
PC member of 2001 and 2003 and Verna

130
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,200
Schindler who is also not and we'd like

131
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,300
the archives and not here I have not

132
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,320
seen him

133
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,899
um he's in PC member of 2003 and also he

134
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,700
played somehow the role of the industry

135
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,339
I mean he is not directly in Academia

136
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,920
good what happened then we had a

137
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,959
deadline of second of may we received

138
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,600
three nominations uh from chess 2001 to

139
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,839
chess 2003 for sure as I explained

140
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,060
um and of course we have selected or we

141
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,700
have considered um a couple of criteria

142
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,040
like um

143
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,399
um uh like the citations and how it has

144
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,800
been seen by the community how many

145
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
other researchers followed these works

146
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
and how many other works have been built

147
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
based on this work and so on and I have

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,540
to say that I mean the paper I mean um I

149
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,040
I want to give actually some information

150
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
about the paper or the award is um

151
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,200
and most of the time now if you are

152
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,660
doing for example a deep learning cycle

153
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,180
or write paper about these deep learning

154
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,100
certainly you talk about for example

155
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,320
some attacks or it's like many other

156
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
attacks but one paper is actually common

157
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,600
in all of those citations because you

158
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,300
know uh for example you can imagine that

159
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,339
you have seen the non-profiling attacks

160
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,019
and also profiling attacks and at the

161
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,240
start you say yeah I mean in in chess

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,519
2002 there was a paper showed that okay

163
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,500
if you have a clone of the circuit then

164
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,139
you can do the profiling and perform the

165
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,600
template attacks and actually the award

166
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,459
goes to the template attack

167
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,139
um yeah

168
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,680
foreign

169
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
we are very thankful that at least two

170
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,839
authors showed up here and it's very

171
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,899
nice

172
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,860
congratulations

173
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,620
of course not only one yeah every

174
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,500
researcher will get one yeah and I will

175
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,420
actually carry this for the missing

176
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,839
Outlook

177
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,620
good thank you so much now this stage is

178
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,380
yours and we are going to listen to The

179
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,360
Talk by

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,940
um by pankaj and also by a good start

181
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,760
all right okay you can have this mic and

182
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,740
it's the problem with me yeah I think

183
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,620
people can hear me yeah

184
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,639
okay yeah sure

185
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,360
so uh let me get started while the

186
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,339
slides come up

187
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,279
um first of all I must say that uh very

188
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,079
very pleased to be here I was there at

189
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,899
the very first chess conference that was

190
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,880
held and in in WPI and uh I was lost at

191
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,600
chess in 2004 but and had many papers in

192
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,899
chess uh but what's very enhartening for

193
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,360
me to see is the turnout even at that

194
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,880
time pankaj and I used to talk with how

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,399
great a conference chess was because of

196
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,800
its interdisciplinary Focus bringing

197
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,339
people from uh all all works of uh you

198
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,860
know cryptography hardware systems

199
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,959
Engineers together and to be in such a

200
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,820
big Hall with this kind of a turnout is

201
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,560
a testimony to the longevity of the

202
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,560
conference uh so that's that's

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
absolutely wonderful so uh thank you

204
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,260
very much to the chess Community for

205
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,540
recognizing this award two of us are

206
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,199
here so Suresh of course

207
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,579
unfortunately could not join and send

208
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,279
his thanks so that's Punk think he's

209
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,079
much more well known in the community

210
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,060
because I think he was working with you

211
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,940
guys for about eight years after when I

212
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,519
I sort of disengaged and that's the

213
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,740
paper so what we're going to be doing

214
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,600
right now is trying to take you through

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,639
a very quick journey I will tell you

216
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,260
very quickly what template attacks are

217
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,740
about right and then we'll try to give

218
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,480
you you know somewhat of a colorful way

219
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,820
some of the background that actually led

220
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,160
to the work that we did together and I

221
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,380
must confess that that was probably the

222
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,019
most enjoyable part actually I've I've

223
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,940
been working at IBM for 30 years and

224
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,459
that that part of my career that's four

225
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,380
five six years when pankaj and I worked

226
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,380
together were very very enjoyable uh and

227
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,760
then we'll talk a little bit about the

228
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,699
Legacy and some future directions and so

229
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,120
uh let's get started pankaj

230
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,300
okay so this is uh the way to kind of

231
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,639
quickly describe template attacks so you

232
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,740
have a Target card and here it's doing

233
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,320
rc4 it's basically putting three bytes

234
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,720
uh secret bytes into the state byte one

235
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,339
by two by three that's the signal you

236
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,620
get and what template attack showed you

237
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
is you could build these templates which

238
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,399
are basically average signals and noise

239
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,459
distributions for all possible values of

240
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,140
the first byte and then you can do a

241
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,819
maximum likelihood test and do this

242
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,339
right and so this the techniques that

243
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,140
were developed actually you know led to

244
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,059
many other things like quantifying

245
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,280
leakages from a device and there's

246
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,839
different types of attacks that worked

247
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,140
on masking next slide

248
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,240
and so this is my favorite part I'm

249
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,339
going to go into the details of the

250
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,980
temporary attack so of course you have n

251
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,919
samples over to overl from some device

252
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,860
and they are K equally likely hypotheses

253
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,760
H1 to HK about some secret unknown value

254
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,340
let P of O slash H be the probability

255
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,640
that hey

256
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,840
you know I don't know if you know about

257
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,000
it this might have been two decades ago

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,919
but this stuff is taught in high school

259
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,840
today so all these guys know this stuff

260
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,320
already let's get to the real part right

261
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,760
actually we went about doing this work

262
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,100
okay so

263
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,059
um

264
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,160
because everybody knows this is folklore

265
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,460
right I mean 1998 Paul culture Joshua

266
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,700
Jaffe benj Benjamin Yoon they did the uh

267
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,940
prior analysis attacks SBA DPA and

268
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,760
literally the uh sales of smart cards

269
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,820
prompted by about 50 so IBM at that time

270
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,880
had a a thriving business in smart cards

271
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,559
and of course this is not something that

272
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,179
they would let go it's something you

273
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,799
need to solve because it affects the

274
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,900
business and typically if with

275
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,360
Industrial Research you've got to solve

276
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,919
the problem before even it gets out into

277
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,799
the domain so this colorful cast of

278
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,240
characters were brought together some of

279
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,000
you can recognize uh don coppersmith

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,480
there challenge myself

281
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,640
and it was like a tiger team that was

282
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
get together the Mandate was very clear

283
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,260
go reproduce these attacks figure out

284
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,720
what enables them and then come up with

285
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,240
counter measures and that was also the

286
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,740
time that we were actually trying to

287
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,220
standardize AES and I remember what we

288
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,780
actually did was analyzed a lot of the

289
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,240
submissions to the AES conference and

290
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,179
pankaj had a great time going to Rome

291
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,880
yeah and and presenting all the problems

292
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,400
side Channel problems with uh all the

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
candidates the 15 candidates that have

294
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,120
been submitted and then we had a paper

295
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,700
that actually followed Paul's paper in

296
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,620
crypto 99 talking about countermeasures

297
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,320
so uh you know the problems got solved

298
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,539
confidence was restored people thought

299
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,640
hey you know we can work we we can work

300
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,919
we have counter measures but then pankaj

301
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,120
and I got together said you know maybe

302
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,799
we can do something more not looking at

303
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,840
power but looking at em and

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
electromagnetic emissions and so we went

305
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,580
and recruited Bruce our Shambo who had a

306
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,039
very uh good background in what was

307
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,039
called EMC Ami it repriminated into uh

308
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,320
you know compatibility and uh in

309
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,580
interception

310
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,000
and so he got for us uh this Broadband

311
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,240
receiver that was Contraband I believe

312
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,280
you can't really get this on the market

313
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,799
and so we put stuff together these

314
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,900
multiple cards put some antennas

315
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,760
together and you know you can actually

316
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,559
see can you read this on the screen that

317
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,840
shows up here and we started showing

318
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,059
many of these kinds of attacks

319
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,700
and and then in the meantime you know

320
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,500
the competition is catching up and

321
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,380
Professor kisketer Raja I'm sorry he's

322
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,840
not here but I love to see him here he

323
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,480
and David samadhi started publishing the

324
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,720
semi and demo attacks and now they

325
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,520
required some carefully positioned

326
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,179
probes they required antennas and

327
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,039
electromagnetic

328
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,780
electromagnetic field probe CNN Pro

329
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,039
field probes

330
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,720
so what our approach was very different

331
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,240
so we decided to publish our results in

332
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,160
the ePrint archives and that was only 15

333
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,860
pages uh that we did there and that

334
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,480
showed up as empowering site Channel

335
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,799
attacks

336
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,780
and then we went and got this guy a

337
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,600
signal Theory expert dakshi Agarwal he

338
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,960
joined the team and uh and using some of

339
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,820
the techniques he provided which pankaj

340
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,400
was alluding to using modeling of noise

341
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,100
and gosh gaussian noise modeling

342
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,840
techniques we were able to attack

343
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
multiple cards and secure crypto

344
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,919
processors but in the space of six

345
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,380
months what we saw was the amount of

346
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,840
stuff that we had on electromagnetic

347
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,059
Emissions on using signal Theory

348
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,860
template the paper was just burgeoning

349
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,160
it was like 42 Pages at that time using

350
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,039
this and and actually just one page was

351
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,340
about signal theory in what we did

352
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,720
so okay so that was very well the 42

353
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,539
pages of em analysis one page was some

354
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,179
theory on on how to do signal processing

355
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,860
and you know this maximum late

356
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,960
likelihood and all of that stuff

357
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,480
so this is the beginning of template

358
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,280
attacks so at the same time we got a car

359
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,320
to IBM hey you know here's the card it

360
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,419
has a Hardware Des engine and we've

361
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,640
deterred it so much that it can you can

362
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,500
see in this there's a section you have a

363
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,480
clicker yeah

364
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,659
foreign

365
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,280
you can see where you see the little bit

366
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,020
rise in the trace that is uh uh let's

367
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,360
clear it this way the rise in the trace

368
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
is where the hardware dies is and so

369
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,620
it's jittered so the 16 clock Cycles is

370
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,419
in some way in this region and if you

371
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,740
take the average Trace you'd see nothing

372
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,000
and you have to do a lot of signal

373
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,620
processing to pull out those 16 Hardware

374
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,000
tests and they thought this is great

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,740
this is the best thing and now side

376
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,539
Channel problem is solved but I don't

377
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,059
IBM why don't you buy this stuff right

378
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,760
but then Suresh who among all three of

379
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,919
us has the best you know nerves were

380
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,419
looking at signals and you know an

381
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,640
eyesight figured out that there is a

382
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,020
structure before it

383
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,820
and this structure is they are trying to

384
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,039
do a CRC check on the key before they

385
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
send it to hardware

386
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
okay and so he spotted this and he said

387
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,159
oh this is something this and this does

388
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,159
not depend on the data okay so then the

389
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,080
idea of doing profiling came into

390
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,320
feeding so you know we could do CRC you

391
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,460
know separate card you can type

392
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,020
different Key by it's still the one you

393
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,760
matches the first and then second byte

394
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
and so on so that's the idea that came

395
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,140
to us hey profiling can be done right

396
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,780
and I would say at this point that Jr

397
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,000
was my manager so let's look at this the

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,980
the

399
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,900
what happened next okay and this is I

400
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,700
think Jr is kind of responsible for this

401
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,340
so I go to Jr hey JR we have tested a

402
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,320
way to break the car we are done right

403
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,640
and he says no no we're not done

404
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
you should try something based on this

405
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,820
bakshi's theory that sit there in this

406
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,020
em paper

407
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
and maybe you can even do it with one

408
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,179
trace and maybe you publish this okay

409
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,640
so then like you know we were we could

410
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,320
do that but then the problem is in those

411
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,140
days it was not kosher to publish attack

412
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,840
on actual Hardware you can't just say

413
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,520
this is a commercial card I broke it

414
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,720
this way because that was really bad

415
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
right so we can't publish right and so

416
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
JL again in the you know his wise

417
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,039
management ways said something like okay

418
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,659
then do it on your own rc4

419
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,059
implementation so that's why we did it

420
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,679
on rc4 although the first thing was

421
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,900
actually on this CRC okay

422
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,240
okay so now we have this Theory it's

423
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,860
just like in theory here this you know

424
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,260
nice thing about noise models and so on

425
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,000
and trying to actually get it to work

426
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,820
was extremely hard so not to say that it

427
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,280
was anything easy right like the signal

428
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,320
is pretty long right I mean there's a

429
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
and you don't know like you know if you

430
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,140
try to take the whole signal it doesn't

431
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,940
work because there's so much noise you

432
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,440
can't put the whole thing through this

433
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
and there's people who have done

434
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,559
template attack knows there's a matrix

435
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,679
inversion that comes in trying to invert

436
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,179
it like a big Matrix that didn't work so

437
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,640
this results were terrible so then we

438
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,980
invented some practical simplifications

439
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,200
and and you know I don't think we link

440
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,539
them very well so things like we call

441
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,000
things interesting points okay so that

442
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,020
we don't have to look at the whole

443
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,400
signal

444
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,500
and so and then we found out that

445
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,059
sometimes we lose the most important

446
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,039
hypothesis so we created this what we

447
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
call the broader approach to building

448
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,179
right so you keep more hypothesis that

449
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,200
way

450
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,780
but after a lot of pain we succeeded and

451
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,460
I think the reason why this paper is

452
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,960
being recognized today

453
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,900
is this result was unexpected single

454
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,080
trace rc4 you get the key that was not

455
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,080
you know expected at this time so I'd

456
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,760
like to apologize to all those who

457
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,039
followed us and went through the turn of

458
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,780
doing The Temper attack but also to

459
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,740
thank them

460
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,600
for all the work that them have done

461
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,159
subsequently to make them more and more

462
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,260
practical so there will be really it was

463
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,240
tough but the thing we we are really

464
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,860
happy to the community for actually

465
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,960
taking it further than than we could

466
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
ever do it okay

467
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,059
so going back what happened to the em

468
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,980
paper that started all this

469
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,100
so it's now 42 pages so again this is Jr

470
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,720
with his infinite business term who's

471
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
going to talk about this so here's your

472
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,460
chest based limit is only 15 pages what

473
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,140
should we do we've got 42 Pages here

474
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,220
okay

475
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,419
and so Jr

476
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,340
that's yeah okay the advice manager

477
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,760
right all right so chess committee comes

478
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,799
back paper is very nice but absolutely

479
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,140
no way we're going to accept this length

480
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,880
work with the shepherd and cut it down

481
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,620
right

482
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,500
so a very limited version called em site

483
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,240
channels also appears in the same chess

484
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,460
but all the maximum likelihood

485
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,320
multivated gaussian noise is out not

486
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,100
there

487
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,659
but I do want to acknowledge that was

488
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,460
how the 42 Page was

489
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,340
okay and a lot of people have complained

490
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,860
to me your initial papers are very dense

491
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,260
well you know Jr and I spent nights and

492
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,080
you know evenings you know arguing about

493
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,059
every sentence how to squeeze as much as

494
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,559
possible into every sentence so that's

495
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,600
what happened 42 pages to like the limit

496
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,880
so that's why they became so dense okay

497
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,880
and so the storm is published in another

498
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,779
place yeah all right Cheers Cheers so

499
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,480
that's the paper uh

500
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,039
yes 2002 it had uh you know we're very

501
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,900
impressed with how it caught on and uh

502
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,460
the citation so there was really no

503
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,860
design behind writing a very impactful

504
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,720
paper we got some results we put it out

505
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,559
there next chart and uh you know several

506
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,539
researchers various team researchers

507
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,520
certainly better researchers than us I

508
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,620
would say pick this up you know went

509
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,539
with it showed you know how one could

510
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,539
make it much more practical and how one

511
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,700
would actually to measure the security

512
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,980
of it and so on especially this last

513
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,679
paper I think I gather this is catching

514
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
on more these days about using AI as a

515
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,299
tool and deep learning techniques uh to

516
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,299
do uh to to break implementations

517
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,000
uh it also had the effect of influencing

518
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,340
some standards especially the ASI and

519
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,179
AIS 19 standard from the BSI both for uh

520
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,279
traditional publicly cryptography as

521
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,100
well as for elliptic curves so very none

522
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,299
of this was planned none of this was

523
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,520
thought but very happy that some of

524
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,320
these things actually came to be

525
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,640
yeah

526
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,440
Okay so

527
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,539
we were

528
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,580
what's the possible future from for

529
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,039
template attacks right and so I think

530
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,620
the opposite here that you know AI is

531
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,419
becoming a very powerful tool and that's

532
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,100
kind of the direction where temporary

533
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,380
attacks are going so if you look at AI

534
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,240
it's revolutionizing the world like you

535
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,980
know there's some picture here of you

536
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,539
know self-driving car there's this

537
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,760
protein folding over there one thing

538
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,640
about AI is that if you make progress in

539
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,659
one field

540
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,880
you typically can use techniques to

541
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,220
improve another one so for example the

542
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,140
protein folding work I've been told

543
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,059
benefited a lot from natural language

544
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,919
processing techniques so those things

545
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,240
came in and that's why they could get

546
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,940
the accurate protein folding right

547
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,980
so deep learning can also be applied to

548
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,240
crypto analysis I know a lot of people

549
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,760
here work on this already right but

550
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,140
there's something about deep learning

551
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,480
and this that actually make it suitable

552
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,039
suitable because this problem that is

553
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,900
suitable right inside Channel you can

554
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,400
collect a lot of data right there is

555
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,740
some ability to do a gradient descent so

556
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,240
there is like differentiable structure

557
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,700
in there and then you can provide some

558
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,400
statistical biases so when AI works it

559
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,960
works very well and it scales the most

560
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,820
so if you look at here deep learning is

561
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,100
kind of the one that will scale whereas

562
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,860
other techniques we do not right

563
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,380
so you know this is kind of the

564
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,360
temporary tax and how you can extend

565
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,820
them to use with using AI so there are

566
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,980
some advantages no Trace processing this

567
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,500
means that there is no uh finding those

568
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,600
interesting points which was which is an

569
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,919
interesting exercise you know by itself

570
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,659
it's not necessary you don't have to

571
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,059
have a leakage based model right and you

572
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,559
can just take a signal and their neural

573
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,360
net will tell you some you know Keys

574
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,980
what's the probability of that being the

575
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,179
right key and then you can if you have

576
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,620
many of those signals you can sum them

577
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,600
up and you do this right and so this is

578
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,279
somewhere that goes on and I think a lot

579
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,340
of people here working on this right now

580
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,380
one thing that was good about those uh

581
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,899
interesting points were you knew you

582
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,159
know you had to figure out first where

583
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,600
the leakage is and then do the template

584
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,240
attack but if when you use uh AI

585
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,580
basically you know just tells you the

586
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,220
answer so here is this picture right so

587
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,539
one neural net is telling you that

588
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,580
they're seeing a dog breed called boxer

589
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,860
in this right another neuron that is

590
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,059
telling you that they can see a tiger

591
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,740
cat right

592
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,720
so now the question is like where is

593
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,980
that information where are you getting

594
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,360
it from so that this thing is called

595
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,679
explainability

596
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,779
which will tell you exactly where

597
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,279
actually this neural net is actually

598
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,600
looking and there is getting the

599
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,179
information about each of these I think

600
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,340
the same can be done with the with side

601
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,480
Channel and there's people who are

602
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,220
working on this already you know so

603
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,440
yours your your neural net tells you you

604
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,360
know that this is there's a leakage but

605
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,799
then you go back and figure out where

606
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,299
the leakage is and then go back to the

607
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,799
code so that's one way to kind of

608
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,440
protect your implementation and this and

609
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,720
get back this interesting points through

610
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,419
through this chain okay

611
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,600
all right so last we mentioned a couple

612
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,480
of things uh you know people here are

613
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,980
very active in this space people are

614
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,179
doing temporary attacks and other things

615
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,399
I would mention two projects where if

616
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,919
you can you know take your knowledge and

617
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,200
put them there in these open source one

618
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,820
of them is open Titan that Dom talked

619
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,440
about there's a lot of places there for

620
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,059
you to actually put temper attacks

621
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:00,720
through

622
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,000
and the other one is open security keys

623
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,799
this is what you know people are who are

624
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,140
you know at risk of getting hacked by

625
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,940
governments they get these security Keys

626
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,860
that's uh you know it's open source you

627
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,720
can you know put good crypto algorithms

628
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,460
on those keys also there are two

629
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,679
possibilities for people to contribute

630
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,559
their technology and make it happen

631
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,840
yeah and so where we'd like to really

632
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,520
end is to provide a little bit of

633
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,500
guidance perhaps for some of the budding

634
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,240
researchers as to where they might Focus

635
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,740
some of their energies in terms of

636
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,820
attacks

637
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,039
purely there are if you see it you know

638
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,559
more and more uh in the industry the

639
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,000
attacks are going deeper into the stack

640
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,399
we know this and this is not just in

641
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,159
consumer devices you're talking about uh

642
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,159
server boards and processors as well

643
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,140
um and that's what has inspired I think

644
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,000
uh some of the chips act that you've

645
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,620
seen in the United States and the

646
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,059
European chips act that we hear about

647
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,580
here and really four areas right

648
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,740
confidential Computing we've been at it

649
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,480
now for more than a couple of decades

650
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,880
but there's a lot that remains to be

651
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,760
done here uh not just in terms of

652
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,860
monitoring uh you know building this

653
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,679
stack the use confidential containers

654
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,899
but to take the bread and butter of this

655
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,700
community things like template attacks

656
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
and look at what those counter measures

657
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,779
would look like on what is called secure

658
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,940
enclaves so even after two years it's a

659
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,919
cross-industry effort uh this is

660
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
something that needs to be done same

661
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,640
thing for fully homomorphic encryption

662
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,640
we all the promise was made about 13

663
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,220
years ago with Craig Gentry uh We've

664
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,720
chipped away at it it's coming within

665
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,700
the realm of practicality there is

666
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,260
Hardware acceleration programs that

667
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,659
DARPA has to build accelerators but at

668
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,039
the end of the days we still have to

669
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,260
prove that secure right I mean there are

670
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,360
formal models that are being brought up

671
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,340
but somebody has to test them and look

672
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,020
at things like side channels template

673
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,360
attacks on such accelerators to make

674
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,240
sure that these are going to be secure

675
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,640
and then finally you know I I you know

676
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,679
there are things like Quantum Computing

677
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,960
and secure chiplets there's going to be

678
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,419
lots of good opportunity to do lots of

679
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,659
good work so with that on behalf of my

680
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,840
uh co-authors uh we thank you very much

681
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,880
ever forward

682
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
thank you

683
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,679
foreign

684
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:08,339
so we're changing a little bit the the

685
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,020
sequence of the program and we're going

686
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,580
to do now the award session then we do a

687
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,020
break so everybody can go outside and

688
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,940
catch a drink and then afterwards we

689
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,739
start to run session and otherwise you

690
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,300
guys have to wait

691
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,080
until 10.

692
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,099
all right so

693
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,599
um

694
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,599
the award session is uh the the purpose

695
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,159
of the award session is basically to to

696
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,440
to thank the people behind the scenes

697
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,859
who make all of this uh possible and

698
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,099
um I would like to start by calling

699
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,960
Thomas and Sonia on stage

700
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,619
under here

701
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,420
so ladies first

702
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,099
is the camera that's for you

703
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,839
Thomas that's for you

704
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,040
okay so just two words because I think

705
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,359
probably most of the people in the room

706
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,160
have no idea what what's the role of a

707
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,240
program shares these are the program

708
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,220
chairs so they are responsible for the

709
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,200
technical contents of the conference

710
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,300
meaning that their job started around

711
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,400
one and a half years ago by first of all

712
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
observing the previous program chairs

713
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,300
for half a year and learn all the tricks

714
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,579
of the trade then they have to write and

715
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,380
publish a call for papers

716
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,839
they have to invite a large

717
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,119
competent program committee that you

718
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,800
know covers all the different topics

719
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,839
that can happen here chess from Puffs to

720
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,820
white box crypto of course side channels

721
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,140
countermeasures faults everything

722
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,420
efficient implementations now you have

723
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,800
to select all these people get them

724
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,599
together kind of convince them that they

725
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
have to invest their time for this

726
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,800
then comes of course the actual work of

727
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,180
you know you get you get in your

728
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,680
submissions you have to check them if

729
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,180
they follow the rules then you have to

730
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,880
assign them to people which is really a

731
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,740
lot of it is really hand work where you

732
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,359
have a huge Matrix with you know

733
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,040
reviewers and papers then you have to

734
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,619
assign them and it's a lot of fun it's

735
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,500
like Tetris for professionals it's crazy

736
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,480
yeah and since just changed to the

737
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,980
journal mode we don't do this once per

738
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,359
year we have to do this four times per

739
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:28,380
year so it's more fun right so

740
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,660
a warm Round of Applause

741
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,899

Peter and Erica

744

because they did this they did it before

745
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,760
and they got this only virtually

746
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,220

748
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,260
get a video from Edgar Leonard

749
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,820
can you switch it around

750
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,619
okay if you switch on your webcam people

751
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,420
are going to see you

752
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,180
so I don't know just just be warned

753
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,960

754
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,820
so I'm always gonna already gonna give

755
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,339
this to Peter we go here

756
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,740
there's Niger Niger is the one with the

757
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,859
camera

758
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,240
and here's Erica

759
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,420
whoa

760
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,800
so that was the last minute you two are

761
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,940
supposed to be here there was some last

762
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,260
minute hiccup with a passport or

763
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,700
something I don't know and she was very

764
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
very upset I'm not going to say the

765
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,180
words that she said but she was not

766
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,640
happy and value that

767
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,560
so

768
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,279
that's it

769
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,040
okay I'm Gonna Mail this to you or give

770
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,200
it to one of your colleagues thank you

771
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,880
so

772
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,740
there's still some people that need a

773
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,000
big thank you

774
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,460
so usually

775
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,780
um when you organize the chess

776
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,460
conference we decide two years in

777
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,579
advance where we have the next chess

778
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,280
around two years in advance but you have

779
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,520
to call it this was all kind of messed

780
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,839
up you know we didn't have physical

781
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,900
chances in the last years and then at

782
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,300
some point during last four we had to

783
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,339
reschedule things and we had to decide

784
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,619
for a location for chess

785
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,800
and so we were looking for crazy people

786
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,839
um that were following that essentially

787
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,040
needed to do the following jobs

788
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,800
essentially organize a conference for

789
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,040
the first time with two tracks

790
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,680
um with let's say yeah less than a year

791
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,320
in advance of organizing this catching a

792
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,119
location

793
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,460
um in a time where essentially all other

794
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,440
events that have been canceled are also

795
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,260
looking for new yeah looking for a lot

796
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,079
of getting a their events done

797
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,359
and we were looking for volunteers that

798
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,160
actually could do their job

799
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,940
and in the end we were very happy that

800
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,980
uh Benedict and svetler then stood up

801
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,480
and said we will do this we will

802
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,780
organize chess 2022 for the first time

803
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,380
with two tracks here in 11 and so please

804
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,020
come on stage so there is a big Applause

805
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,280
for them I think

806
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,820
