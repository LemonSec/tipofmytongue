1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,120
thank you

2
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,300
all right

3
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,920
welcome back everyone

4
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,800
um before I head over to my co-chair

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,920
Jacob to open the wrong session

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,379
officially I have to make one very very

7
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,000
important announcement

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,219
I mean I've just been told by the

9
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,980
general chair that outside there's all

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,420
kind of signs saying that you're not

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,640
allowed to drink in this room so please

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,719
enjoy the wrong session

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,500
hi everyone I hope people online can use

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,420
if there is someone online can you

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,280
please scream and tell you can hear us

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,760
internet people can you say something

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,860
we can't hear you yes

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,780
I I heard her yes I don't know if it was

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,979
someone impersonating the internet

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,420
people I hope not

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,680
so

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,659
last year I co-chaired the room session

23
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,240
with you over yaron and you will ask me

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,820
to do to share bits of wisdom

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,500
with the chess community so I'm doing

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,479
the same so I will share some bits of

27
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,280
wisdom I hope you appreciate

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,740
uh what I'm about to share

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
so first I need to figure out how to

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020
yeah so this is the cryptography

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,540
Multiverse right

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,540
you have the trunk in the middle which

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,119
is like mainstream cryptography research

34
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,820
and then something happens in time where

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
a new timeline is born right you have

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,520
the TCC one the chess one FSC and so on

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,079
there might be even a new one for the

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,360
new Journal right it's we branching

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
timelines all the time but this actually

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,880
creates tension right as this timelines

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,979
diverge and they fragment the community

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,640
there's tension between these timelines

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,920
and that can create hostility timelines

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,959
can become hostile against each other

45
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
and that's not a good thing

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,080
so one reason the incursion of the chair

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,760
subcommunity to the theoretical

48
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,980
cryptography Community was chess people

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,620
submitting papers to your Crypt and it

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,540
seems we did quite well we had the

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,280
highest acceptance rate of eurocrypt

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,560
let's celebrate that is yeah

53
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,800
that's all don't come on there this

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,920
image is used without permission

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,200
and this talks about the Multiverse

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,060
right last time I gave this talk we're

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,260
like oh are you talking about the

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,599
metaverse no it's not this nft crap it's

59
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,760
not about apes

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,959
if there is someone from ABC mint here

61
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,260
by the way Matthias is here too you owe

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,599
him money

63
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,980
please pay

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,260
it's not about this matter verse crap as

65
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,239
well right it's if you work at Facebook

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,340
I'm sorry your life must be very sad

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,019
now to the serious part

68
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,180
so there's some fascinating applied uh

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,040
crypto research being done or in crypto

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,420
engineering research being done out

71
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,819
there and we in particular think that

72
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,340
zero knowledge probes and NPC research

73
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,379
is not being properly represented at

74
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,400
shares

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,980
so together with Marcel we decided to

76
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,780
extend the cfp for next year you

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,980
probably have seen this in the website

78
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,440
already to include two new topics which

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,940
is exactly engineering of zero knowledge

80
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,680
proof systems and also privacy

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,299
preserving competition in general we

82
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,159
received already enough uh not enough

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,739
It's never enough right some fhg papers

84
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,080
but we also want NPC papers

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,180
and we need the community to contribute

86
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,819
such that one particular set Feature

87
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,519
Future never happens so

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,220
we don't want one particular feature to

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,640
happen which is like this one so we want

90
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,560
many privacy preserving computation

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
papers on chess especially the crypto

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,980
engineering aspects of that if you want

93
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,900
to submit talk to us talk to me Marcel

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,459
send us an email if you have questions

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,459
so now to the ramp session program I'm

96
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,919
absolutely appalled to announce that

97
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,440
received 17 submissions which is nice a

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
prime number one had to be withdrawal

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,340
because of censorship one one submission

100
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,620
was withdrawn because of censorship it

101
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,020
was a top level management order we

102
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,580
cannot talk much about it because we

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,320
receive a gag order at the same time

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
it's like I think this will change from

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,820
sessions forever and we need to make it

106
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,400
stand the protest against censorship

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,240
so we got 16 still find power of 2.

108
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,580
as co-chairs we shortlist candidates for

109
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,320
you to decide on the room session award

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,680
also called RSA

111
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,540
and then

112
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,880
Peter had an adventure today he went out

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,120
to buy RSA and actually somewhere here I

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,259
don't know exactly what that is but he

115
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,180
told me it's down here

116
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,280
and one thing for sure is it was cheaper

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,860
than the 10 million that the NSA paid to

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,620
buy RSA and back toward their crypto

119
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,479
Library

120
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
not much though

121
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,419
so you get to decide or you get to vote

122
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,860
but at the end we decide who wins

123
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,419
anyways right but you know voting is

124
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,000
important democracy is important

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,940
this is the uh Rim session program so we

126
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,039
start with the serious stuff the chairs

127
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
report that's Tonya and then we go to

128
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
announcements right and then we have a

129
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,220
break a 10 minute a 20 minute break it

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,960
seems for you to maybe review and

131
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,000
recharge and then we have some amusing

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,960
talks

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,199
some two important logistic information

134
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,419
um time limits will be enforced so we

135
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,280
actually do our best to move you away

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
off this stage if you're taking too much

137
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,740
time

138
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,259
the other thing is if you submitted a

139
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,600
token was accepted by the way if you

140
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,520
were not you know a victim of censorship

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,160
uh I should also if you want to protest

142
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
against censorship talk to Benedict he's

143
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,780
responsible for that so hey pay

144
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
attention to the program and Community

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
stage such that we can have like a

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,120
smooth pipeline of Speakers Going

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
through now I give the word to uh Tonya

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,979
to share the report

149
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:25,758
are you recording this

150
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,239
foreign

151
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,400
yeah hi so we would like to give a short

152
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
report on how the program about the

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,660
chess program and how it came to be

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,560
and um as it goes with conferences and

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
transactions it usually starts with good

156
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,280
research which then is written up at

157
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,500
some point and um submitted

158
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,840
being reviewed and then finally

159
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,479
presented as a conference so with chess

160
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,639
you have four um opportunities per year

161
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,699
to submit your um your papers if you do

162
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,400
so you will be reviewed by um for peers

163
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,440
that are experts in their field they

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,900
will take about two months to review and

165
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,180
discuss your work in the middle you have

166
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,400
um you have a chance to interact and

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,620
actually look at the reviews and clarify

168
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,660
misunderstandings um in the rebuttal

169
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,120
phase all right so far so good a few

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,860
things we tried um to do differently

171
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,860
this time we included an appendix uh the

172
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,560
appendix in the revenue process making

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,740
sure it gets reviewed and um we also

174
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,539
introduced the PC meeting towards the

175
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,360
end of the reviewing phase to Foster

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,039
discussions and actually

177
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,699
um yeah so people um papers that were um

178
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,160
where there was a discussion going on

179
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,960
and there was contentious discussions um

180
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,240
so to come to a good decision in the end

181
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,419
and about 18 papers uh 18 of the papers

182
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,400
went through this process so I think

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,919
that was quite a nice change in total we

184
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
got the 283 uh submissions

185
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,319
um that resulted in a total of 1200

186
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,660
reviews most of those reviews were

187
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,259
completed by the members of our program

188
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,020
committee consisting of 66 people

189
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,560
and in addition we had about 83 external

190
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,919
reviews from other experts in the field

191
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,840
and as we are at a deadline driven

192
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,940
Community you all know that if you

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
submitted usually um the number of

194
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,660
submissions spikes towards the end of

195
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,819
the deadline the same is also true for

196
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,500
uh for the reviews which need to be

197
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,180
already in time before the rebuttal

198
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,039
phase and we'll see the same behavior

199
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,620
there right so we see a nice Spike and

200
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,880
of course there are a lot more

201
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,219
interesting

202
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,820
statistics yeah so Thomas and I worked

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
very hard in building a nice great

204
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,339
program committee so for that we tried

205
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,940
to balance it uh according to different

206
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,339
aspects and some of them are displayed

207
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,620
here so we tried to balance the gender

208
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,660
of course we couldn't have we cannot

209
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,500
achieve half-half but we tried I will

210
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,360
also try to balance the affiliation

211
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
between Academia industry and government

212
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,300
and we also tried to balance uh the

213
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,480
country like the continents where the PC

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
members came from between Europe Asia

215
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,820
and Americas something which is not

216
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,160
displayed on this slide is we also try

217
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,580
to have uh fresh blood namely uh new

218
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,339
people in the community with absolutely

219
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,800
no istrpc experience and so we had uh 27

220
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,380
percent of fresh blood in our program

221
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
committee and we are very happy with

222
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,300
that because they did a great job and

223
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,580
they did yeah nice reviews and we are

224
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,700
super happy that we had them

225
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,399
now some statistics as usual on the

226
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,920
submitted and accepted papers so here

227
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,899
you can see the the submitted and

228
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,959
accepted papers for the past 20 years so

229
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,180
the number of the mission is growing

230
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,720
especially since uh 2018. now we are in

231
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
German mode and of course the number of

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,800
accepted papers is growing as well

233
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,080
because we have quite a constant

234
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,040
acceptance rate

235
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,040
uh if you submit it to chess last year

236
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040
or this year you probably know that when

237
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,620
you submit a paper of the the program

238
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,839
committee is working very hard on it and

239
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,720
then the reviewers converge towards uh

240
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,940
one of these five decisions so either

241
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,339
you pay so your paper is accepted is

242
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,560
there uh it's a minor revision meaning

243
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,200
that you have you are followed by your

244
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,940
Shepherd for one month to improve your

245
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,300
work all of them were finally accepted

246
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,700
either uh you receive a major revision

247
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
decision meaning that you have a list of

248
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,160
criteria a list of improvements from the

249
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,899
reviewers and you can resubmit your

250
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,260
paper with these improvements done to be

251
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,339
accepted you can also um get a reject

252
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,860
decision with encouragement to receive

253
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,339
it meaning that the Rogers uh decided

254
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,260
that your paper is not ready yet but has

255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,600
a potential of course you can be

256
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
rejected as well so he has here are the

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,339
statistics for these five decision for

258
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,820
issue

259
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,279
now the statistics of submitted and

260
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,459
accepted papers per category so you can

261
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,459
see that of course if you a reasonable

262
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,800
observation is to see that the paper we

263
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,279
got which got a major revision decision

264
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,160
have a much higher acceptance rate than

265
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,160
the regular paper so the regular paper

266
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,620
you have 29 person acceptance rate and

267
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,380
the major revision people it grows to 80

268
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,839
percent which means that I want to

269
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,120
believe that the the job made by the

270
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,339
Australian Observer viewers is important

271
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,640
to increase this this number also if you

272
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,500
have a paper which got rejected with

273
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,600
encouragement to recipe you also have a

274
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,279
higher acceptance rate

275
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,860
probably because of also the the work of

276
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,720
the Austria sensor of yours

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,620
and now uh a paradoxical observation is

278
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,720
that if you submit a long paper you also

279
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,019
have a higher acceptance rate which is

280
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,640
product because personally when I

281
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,980
receive a long paper I'm not super happy

282
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,800
I prefer reviewing regular shorter

283
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,500
papers but so my intuition my guess

284
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,779
would be that the reviewer they want to

285
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,279
make sure that they won't review your

286
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
paper again and so

287
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,620
just my intuition

288
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,160
a last a last graph maybe my favorite

289
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
one the number of submitted elected

290
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,140
papers according to the number of

291
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,839
authors paper paper

292
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,839
so a stupid advice that I can give you

293
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,360
here is that don't submit a paper with

294
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,480
nine authors go in the streets ask your

295
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,940
husband your wife your kid to go sign

296
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,220
the paper because you will multiply your

297
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,380
chance to be accepted to be accepted by

298
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,279
fall

299
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,920
but don't go over that number because

300
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,740
otherwise it got down to zero right be

301
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,720
careful

302
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,019
foreign

303
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,880
that brings us to the program which you

304
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,860
have already enjoyed for a day now so we

305
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,920
accepted a total of 83 papers most of

306
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,720
them are presented in a double track

307
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,120
fashion there's only a few presentations

308
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,579
that are an exception to that so one

309
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,260
will be the best paper which will be

310
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,000
presented on Wednesday in single track

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,279
and then there are the two invited talks

312
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,380
one was already given today by Dominic

313
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,600
Rizzo and the other one will be given

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,019
tomorrow by Martin Albrecht

315
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,300
besides that we had some other

316
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,519
components in the program as well

317
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,320
um the tutorials and the taser Workshop

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,220
which happened on on Sunday and we also

319
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,560
have to continuously ongoing poster

320
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,060
sessions so if you haven't used the

321
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,040
chance to look at the posters and to

322
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,260
talk to the authors

323
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,880
um yeah make sure you grab a chance at

324
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,680
some point they are actually shown

325
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,620
outside the lecturing Halls so please

326
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,380
yeah use that chance

327
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,700
um one other thing we would like to

328
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,560
point out is the artifact evaluation

329
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,420
which we have had for the last um two

330
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,180
years and it continues on so if you are

331
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,980
publishing if you have a paper accepted

332
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,959
at chess you have the opportunity to

333
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,480
submit artifacts such as code or data

334
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,440
sets

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,360
um to be reviewed and then

336
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,399
um

337
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,620
included with a

338
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,260
um

339
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,579
on the website with the with the paper

340
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,420
basically and um please please consider

341
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,100
that because it helps increase

342
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,980
reproducibility and the uh at the moment

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,440
it's voluntary but definitely it's also

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,019
encouraged and um as it's an important

345
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,459
Point Peter will talk a bit more about

346
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,100
it in a moment right so

347
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,019
um so overall

348
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,600
we hope you enjoy the program so um

349
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,180
there were many people working very hard

350
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,760
to get it ready for this conference of

351
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,260
course there's a program committee and

352
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,420
the external reviewers who invested a

353
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,820
lot of time in in the reviews there's uh

354
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,220
the managing editor Tim and with the

355
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,220
support on of Marcus and our web chairs

356
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,800
Peter and Reuben

357
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,600
um the tutorial speaker who makes it

358
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,579
possible to access the work there's a

359
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,260
tutorial speakers posters and session

360
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,579
chairs who have been helping out

361
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,680
throughout the conference on the

362
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,320
artifact and evaluation committee and

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,240
most importantly of course the people

364
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,279
who actually produce the work on the

365
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,660
authors and the people who actually

366
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,579
presented in nice presentations

367
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,139
throughout the conference the speakers

368
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,019
so um yeah let's let's thank them right

369
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,899
all right as already announced

370
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,420
um I have the honor of talking about the

371
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,180
teachers artifact evaluation I should

372
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,139
say that really should be Martin

373
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,540
standing here but Martin can't be

374
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,880
addressed while at least not today

375
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,199
um so I have been volunteered to give

376
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,220
this talk

377
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,019
and I thought well if I give this talk I

378
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,540
would start with a short review of the

379
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,399
rich history of the chess artifact

380
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,139
evaluation

381
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,000
which basically means that it started

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,699
all in 2021 and I must say that Douglas

383
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,500
uh Stabila did an amazing job at

384
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,959
actually establishing all of this

385
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,240
um it continued in 2022 with Martin

386
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,579
Albright who should be standing here and

387
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,980
it will be continuing in 2023 with me

388
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,540
probably again standing in front and

389
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,980
giving this talk

390
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,019
by the way if you're wondering

391
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,360
um how you're becoming artifact chair it

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,740
basically works as follows at least from

393
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
my limited experience I can speak here

394
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,060
you get invited to become a PC member

395
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,620
and then at some point you receive a

396
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,180
message from the PC chairs telling you

397
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,040
that you're Uninvited to be a PC member

398
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,259
but that the job of artifact evaluation

399
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,779
share would still be available so

400
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,360
so here I am

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,160
thanks Diego thanks Diego yeah

402
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,880
um now now given that this history is

403
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,860
rather young um some people here may

404
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,360
actually not be super familiar with the

405
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,939
concept yeah so I thought it probably

406
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,199
makes sense to at least say a little bit

407
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,599
about what this whole thing is so the

408
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,059
idea is that authors of accepted papers

409
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,520
at teachers are invited to submit

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,380
artifacts which could be software or

411
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,880
Hardware implementations could be data

412
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,799
sets but could be all kind of things

413
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,020
that basically add value to the paper

414
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,220
um the goal of the artifact evaluation

415
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,260
process is then to ensure that these

416
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,880
artifacts are functional for example

417
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,580
that software compiles and runs and that

418
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,260
it's reusable so for example that

419
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,940
there's a proper readme that there's the

420
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,260
code is commented that you might be able

421
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,600
to easily modify it

422
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,940
um we're not trying to uh actually go

423
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,700
into reproducing the scientific results

424
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,919
that are presented in the paper so we're

425
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,600
helping reproducibility with this of

426
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,919
course by making sure that at least it

427
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,440
runs but we're not looking into uh

428
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,860
actually reproducing the results

429
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,840
how's this done well there's a hot crap

430
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,460
instance so you can just submit your

431
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,559
artifact on hot crap and these artifacts

432
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,820
will need to include of course the

433
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,980
actual code or data they also need to

434
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,440
include a readme and a license file and

435
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,160
then

436
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,020
um so the artifacts um themselves

437
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,340
they're not anonymous because we know

438
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,600
anyway who wrote the paper because

439
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,740
that's already published on the

440
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,120
teacher's website or the list of

441
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
accepted papers

442
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,980
um and then they receive three Anonymous

443
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,200
reviews so the reviews remain anonymous

444
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,539
and usually after the reviews there's an

445
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,160
interactive process of improving the

446
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
artifact so usually one of the reviewers

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
at least on their system was not able to

448
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
build it or run it or the output was not

449
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,299
as expected or something and then

450
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,980
possibly there's a Shepherd being

451
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,160
assigned and the shepherd then uh well

452
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,320
helps improve the artifact

453
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,200
the goal is essentially to accept all

454
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,179
artifacts that and at least will bring

455
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,919
them to a point that they're you know

456
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,660
functional and reusable and then accept

457
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,820
them and once they are at that State

458
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,940
they get archived at

459
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,539
artifacts.icr.org that's the website

460
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,580
that was also well introduced with this

461
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,100
process in 2021 and then you get a link

462
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,660
from the paper to that artifact from

463
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
teachers.icr.org

464
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,299
so there's a lot of being said about

465
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,039
evaluation criteria on a website

466
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,140
actually this is the website so if you

467
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,460
want to read all the details go through

468
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
that but essentially the the idea behind

469
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,820
it is imagine you're a student in a

470
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,340
couple of years say 2029 first year grad

471
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,020
student who's told by their advisor so

472
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,299
just take this artifact from chess 2022

473
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,460
and just do something with it change it

474
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,039
to do X and what we want is that the

475
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,539
student has the best chance of success

476
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,820
and the least amount of pain

477
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,799
and that's also why often the artifact

478
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,539
evaluation committee there's a lot of

479
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,039
young researchers there's PhD students

480
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,900
there's postdocs um because those are

481
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,820
the people who would go through the pain

482
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,559
usually of making these things work if

483
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,900
they're not properly written and it's

484
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,400
also I think a very nice way for for

485
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
young people in the community to get

486
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
involved um in the in the chess

487
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,039
reviewing process

488
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,039
now as an author you might feel like why

489
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,020
would I do this right so my paper's

490
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,179
already accepted so why would I spend

491
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,580
additional effort more time on an

492
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,660
artifact

493
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,340
oh it's essentially two ounces to this

494
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,559
one is it's a service to the community I

495
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,120
mean there's many people we've already

496
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,799
got quite a bit of Round of Applause but

497
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,120
you can do it again for all of the

498
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,740
people sitting here in the front really

499
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,780
doing all of this work here to run Jeff

500
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,260
locally

501
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,940
but making your software available

502
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
making your Hardware available making

503
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,179
sure that it's still available in a

504
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,740
couple of years and it still runs in a

505
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,720
couple of years makes the scientific

506
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,460
aspect of our community so much more

507
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,980
rich and valuable and and helps people

508
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,679
actually contribute to this community

509
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,120
but you might ask okay but but still but

510
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,640
what's in it for me and it turns out

511
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,559
that it really increases the relevance

512
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,260
of your paper and of your results so for

513
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,600
example it increases your visibility by

514
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,419
up to 72 percent

515
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,660
it also brings up your citation count to

516
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,380
up by 43 if you submit an artifact

517
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
you get more future collaborations from

518
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,460
this so it goes up to about 2.3

519
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,039
collaborations if you submit an artifact

520
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,919
and you get more future funding So at

521
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,280
around 60k per artifact that you will

522
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,260
get in future funding as you may have

523
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,460
noticed these numbers are completely

524
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,960
made up right

525
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
but really it's it's it I think it does

526
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,620
really help and it does really improve

527
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,120
the value of your paper and the

528
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,100
visibility

529
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,200
so with this I would like to actually

530
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,940
thank the artifact evaluation committee

531
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,980
for 2022 there's a lot of people who did

532
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,600
an absolutely amazing job at evaluating

533
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,580
these artifacts except for this one guy

534
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,559
Peter Schwab he's still um shepherding a

535
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,120
paper from issue three and he's super

536
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,440
slow it shouldn't be reinvited to the

537
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,480
committee it's really terrible but aside

538
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
from that you know amazing job and maybe

539
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,480
you can also give these people a round

540
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,980
of applause

541
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,200
[Music]

542
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,320
now you've seen already lots of lots of

543
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,120
Statistics the statistics are very

544
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,919
simple for artifacts uh they were all

545
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,840
accepted

546
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,460
um there's maybe one thing that is

547
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,200
noticeable about the slide still for

548
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,700
issue two there was only one submitted

549
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,559
artifact that might be just a statistic

550
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,179
outlier or maybe advertisement when

551
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,100
wrong or something we don't know it was

552
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,220
just one but in a sum

553
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,440
um we got more than 30 percent of the

554
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
chess 2022 papers they come without

555
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,340
effects I think this is pretty pretty

556
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,360
cool

557
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,820
well but you could also say those are

558
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,640
rookie numbers right so for 2023 when

559
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm sharing this let's get these numbers

560
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,900
up and please submit your artifacts and

561
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,340
if you have a paper already accepted the

562
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,159
issue one of t2s2023 the deadline is

563
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
October 28th thank you for your

564
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,080
attention

565
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,640
good evening my name is macho Rivera

566
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,039
sorry I won't be doing a funny talk and

567
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,980
this one at least it's funny it's uh not

568
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,720
on purpose

569
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,059
um just a short announcement that we are

570
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,280
looking for organizers for the next

571
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,380
edition of the chess challenge

572
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,260
so as you might know we have a challenge

573
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,880
Associated to chess since 2015 but not

574
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,760
this year which is unfortunate so we'll

575
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,620
have a lot of expectation for the

576
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,559
Challenger of the next year

577
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,799
um so we welcome any proposal of uh

578
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,380
challenge organization

579
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
um so it should be related to Chester

580
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,140
Beach it should Target the chess

581
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,400
audience

582
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,880
and uh that's about it so you can find

583
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,940
all the information on this webpage and

584
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,419
chess 2023 website

585
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,299
and uh yeah that's it for me enjoy the

586
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,840
ramification

587
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,120
and I'm back but this is actually a

588
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,919
remote talk so I think we may need a

589
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,780
little bit of tech support now Abdullah

590
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,159
you should be sharing your screen but

591
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,380
maybe we should be un sharing it and I

592
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,000
don't know I don't have the power here

593
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
so uh there's only one remote talk we

594
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,080
need to do this only once at the very

595
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,059
beginning now

596
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,020
thank you

597
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,419
can you guys hear me we can hear you

598
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,360
okay

599
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:43,039
okay let me know when I can start

600
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,539
okay

601
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,140
yeah

602
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,159
please go ahead

603
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,159
okay

604
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,620
so hello everyone I'm Abdullah uh today

605
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,059
we're going to talk about solving the

606
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,620
code star problem for reading research

607
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,480
papers with ask crypto

608
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,620
so I don't know if you remember in

609
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,400
eurocrypt 2021 uh I made another ROM

610
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,799
session talk titled decode start problem

611
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,440
for reading research papers and

612
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,820
basically today we're going to talk

613
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,580
about solving this problem but before a

614
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,960
small reminder about what the problem

615
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,700
was

616
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,860
uh so this is the Journey of a person

617
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,679
who is uh reading a paper and naturally

618
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,720
there are questions

619
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,299
and when we have questions we

620
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,700
try to ask the authors or some other

621
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,340
people that we know and this interaction

622
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,900
is usually private

623
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,120
and no other people can benefit from it

624
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,539
usually you can argue that this does not

625
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,100
necessarily occur in private you can

626
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,740
also ask it on Twitter but public does

627
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,080
not necessarily mean easily locatable so

628
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,960
these are also uh not very convenient

629
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,779
for other people to find later and this

630
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,700
is for a single paper so that's why it

631
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,320
is called the cold start problem it

632
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,360
basically says whenever you're reading a

633
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,279
paper it's as if you're reading it

634
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,679
you're the first person who's reading it

635
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,760
in the world

636
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,279
and when you go to the references this

637
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,460
basically blows up exponentially

638
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,460
and what I proposed last time was to

639
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,380
pre-compute construct lookup tables and

640
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,299
make them publicly available this is a

641
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,760
direct analogy to a naive solution for a

642
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
exponential size problem

643
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
and basically since that talk I tried to

644
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
execute the solution and now we have as

645
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
cryptography it's a non-commercial

646
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,360
platform to basically discuss and ask

647
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,400
questions about papers on ePrint

648
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,260
cryptology archive

649
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,260
and let's see how it works so first

650
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,419
thing we need to have is to we need to

651
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,000
have a single page per paper because for

652
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,460
making things easily accessible we need

653
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,500
good indexing and luckily we already

654
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,360
have that index it's the ePrint

655
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,299
cryptology archive and the indexing is

656
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,860
actually very simple this is just a year

657
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,620
and the sequence number so

658
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,419
we did the same we have a single page

659
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,960
per paper and not only that the URLs are

660
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,700
almost identical you just change the

661
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,440
root domain and then you land on the

662
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,580
main page

663
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,679
so what's on the main page for a paper

664
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,080
you see some basic information on the

665
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
top and in the bottom uh there are

666
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
certain there's certain you can see all

667
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,279
the topics about this paper so far note

668
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,020
that this is not this is not simply

669
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,179
attaching a comment section to papers if

670
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,940
there's a organized way of doing this

671
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,799
and there there are different topics and

672
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,360
you can basically click to them and then

673
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,679
expand

674
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,900
so what kind of topics we have

675
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,480
three of the we have three of them First

676
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,100
Resource this basically includes some

677
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,140
metadata and then other people can

678
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,539
basically post any kind of resource

679
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,240
about this paper uh for instance like

680
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,740
chess is a good audience for this

681
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,679
because artifacts are motivated and for

682
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,380
ISR conferences if available talks and

683
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,000
slides are automatically added to these

684
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,500
resources

685
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,120
then we also have questions and

686
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,980
discussions these are self-explanatory

687
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,380
but the important thing is that all

688
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,179
topics are related to at least one paper

689
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,700
if your question is not related to a

690
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,960
paper but it is still related to

691
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,059
cryptography they're already very good

692
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,220
platforms for doing this

693
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,559
what this platform aims is that to

694
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,419
collect the questions about papers and

695
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,100
make them stick to the paper so that

696
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,860
other people can look at them easily

697
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,720
all right so this is for like a reading

698
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,740
experience

699
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,260
what do we have for authors you can

700
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,880
basically become a verified author if

701
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,820
you have any paper on ePrint and there

702
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,740
are some functionalities for them

703
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,080
for instance your username usernames are

704
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,640
displayed on related topics to your

705
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,620
papers so that when you whenever you

706
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,240
post

707
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,740
um people will know that you are the

708
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
person who is the author

709
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,419
secondly maybe more importantly you can

710
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,620
choose to receive automatic

711
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,360
notifications about new topics on your

712
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
papers and lastly this is Neo I just

713
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,039
enabled this feature just before this

714
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,500
talk there's now that my papers drop

715
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,179
down where you can quickly access your

716
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,159
papers search through them then go

717
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,679
through the main Pages easily

718
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,460
okay some so some stats uh the platform

719
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,559
was publicly announced in 22nd of August

720
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,559
so we're three days short of a month we

721
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,140
currently have 178 users for the seven

722
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,539
of those are verified authors and there

723
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,399
has been 10 questions so foreign six of

724
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,899
them were already answered and I'm

725
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,460
pretty sure the rest will be answered as

726
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,240
well so that's it from my Slide the

727
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,399
takeaway is that the takeaway is that

728
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,260
the platform is there now it is

729
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,419
functioning as intended and the more you

730
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,700
use it the more it will be useful so if

731
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
you have questions about papers that you

732
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,419
read just bring them all to ask crypto

733
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,899
thanks

734
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,059
all right thank you very much

735
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,059
okay Colin are you here you're behind me

736
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,179
that's great all right what was yours

737
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,380
all right

738
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,120
um thanks very much so before I begin I

739
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,159
have an even less funny quick story um I

740
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,020
have to thank pankaj it sort of seems

741
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,520
fitting with the test of time award

742
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,100
about 10 or so years ago I forget

743
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,440
exactly now there's the chess challenge

744
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,720
you could get this acebo board

745
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,279
um if you email them and you say like

746
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,899
please I would like this board to do

747
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,220
some fun stuff so I was one of the

748
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,640
recipients of this as Colin unknown guy

749
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,640
who claims to be doing a PhD at the time

750
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,080
um and you can see that board in some of

751
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,580
the original chip Whisperer papers so I

752
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,659
have to say thank you you know the test

753
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,760
of time it's not only a testament to the

754
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,120
work then but what happened later so

755
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,380
unrelated but

756
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,380
um so here I am to talk to you before

757
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,700
the last uh chess event in person I had

758
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,740
some discussions on post Quantum crypto

759
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,179
and what I saw is the most important

760
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,220
thing about post Quantum that there is

761
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,679
other problems like time travel could

762
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,020
exist and other things could exist so

763
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,700
then I said okay what if I indulge you

764
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,940
what if I accept these people that claim

765
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,179
a post quantum computer could exist one

766
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,520
day maybe and if we look at the story

767
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,140
the story is always very simple there

768
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,760
will be a post quantum computer but

769
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,559
don't worry we will solve the post

770
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,960
Quantum problem and the world will be

771
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,760
fine but is that what will happen if we

772
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,279
have them and we accept this we say well

773
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,679
okay RSA is broken all of the internet

774
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,559
banking is broken everyone can steal

775
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,179
money from everyone right the world will

776
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,279
not look like a nice world with post

777
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,260
Quantum enabled right it looks something

778
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,880
like this world

779
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,760
um and so my question is is post Quantum

780
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
crypto actually targeting a post Quantum

781
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,980
world and are these constructions

782
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,140
relevant for a post Quantum world so I

783
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,299
thought I would do a very short survey

784
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,179
of the proposals around post Quantum and

785
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,799
how they apply to the the post Quantum

786
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,799
world we might see okay so I picked a

787
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
few I I didn't have much time to look

788
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,700
into it I admit so um correct me later

789
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,220
if they're wrong uh oil and vinegar

790
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,140
signature scheme so this one I think

791
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,580
will be very relevant because if we

792
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,799
think about the post Quantum World

793
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,600
um if we look on some verified websites

794
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,039
like YouTube we find some very

795
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,140
interesting things about how oil can be

796
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,940
turned into a flamethrower so I think

797
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,919
this is immediately yes this is a check

798
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,760
mark for post Quantum so we are good

799
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
um another popular proposal is around

800
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,260
lattice based post Quantum crypto

801
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,580
um so this one if we consider the

802
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,899
structure of lattice and the strength it

803
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,580
gives us we can see that there is

804
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,260
actually really good applications for

805
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,779
lattice based systems in a true post

806
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,399
Quantum world because this strength you

807
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,840
need in this sort of cow capture is

808
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,399
critical right and the lattice provides

809
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,919
this this sort of strength to you

810
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,960
um the final one I very quickly analyzed

811
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,820
was sort of a sponge-based thing and you

812
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,500
might think the sponge base immediately

813
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,940
lends itself to this sort of

814
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,740
post-quantum world because

815
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,299
um you notice everyone's quite dirty so

816
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,679
you expect they would need like sponge

817
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,260
bass type things but you are forgetting

818
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,419
a post Quantum world no because there is

819
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,520
no water in this post Quantum world we

820
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,860
we have ruined the resources that is

821
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,059
stolen

822
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,860
um and so the sponge based is written

823
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,899
off immediately

824
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,299
um so yeah and quick conclusions right

825
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,919
these constraints have been dreamed up

826
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,600
by the cryptographers the future world

827
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,820
and we didn't let the wolf guard the hen

828
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,620
house they designed the hen house right

829
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,240
that's Insanity

830
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,580
um so I implore you the chess Community

831
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,399
we need to spend more time applying

832
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,440
these post-conomy algorithms to a true

833
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,120
post Quantum world thank you

834
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,580
oh okay good evening I'm dongjun Park uh

835
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,519
unfortunately I need this huge script

836
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,740
book because I'm a family of the English

837
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,779
please understand me

838
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,159
uh

839
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,679
this is my first time in chess and I'm

840
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,140
glad to stand here in front of you I'm

841
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,299
going to talk about the end accelerator

842
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,700
and its challenges in terms of side

843
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,200
channels

844
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,720
everybody knows about DNA dolls even

845
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,418
though nobody knows how it works uh

846
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,599
since training on creates DNA means a

847
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,800
huge effort

848
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,560
the structure of the network and the

849
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,918
exact value of parameters should be kept

850
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,480
secret

851
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,260
however in the real world there are too

852
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,599
many bad guys trying to steal variable

853
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,359
DNA models from accelerators

854
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,520
do you know guys

855
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,659
do you guys know here

856
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,760
thank you something special and

857
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,879
occasions developed by experts in the AI

858
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,760
field and you know the sense Decay they

859
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,580
utilize also sign chain and fault

860
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,639
injection attacks as well

861
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,239
another example of that act is to derive

862
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,200
the misclassification last night I took

863
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,960
a hot shower without noticing the door

864
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,859
was open what happened next

865
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,680
please your head

866
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,920
yes the smoke detector went off due to

867
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,770
the steam

868
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,460
[Music]

869
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,579
a lesson love you should book a large

870
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,980
and expansion Loom if you wanna take a

871
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,540
long shower

872
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,720
this might be an example of

873
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,190
misclassification right

look at the lizard

876
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,980
look at the lizard that shows a lot of

877
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,380
people saying yes we could steal your

878
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,920
mothers uh please notice that I'm not

879
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,740
saying these authors are bad guys I

880
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,920
absolutely respect them it's hard to

881
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,160
defend against all the attacks but we

882
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,220
should do our first

884
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,320
willing to do the most difficult works

885
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,420
because they are difficult not easy

886
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,920

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,359

908
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,900
some oh a lot of people that's great so

909

I forget what it stands for sometimes

912
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,859
it's cryptography robustness and

913
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,260
probably secure schemes for female young

914
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,119
researchers so it's a workshop on this

915
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,800
topic

916
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
um so we are having this this year in

Passau I'm organizing with Juliana Crema

918
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,380

next talk is also yours you can just

934
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,740
push the space bar and don't need to get

935
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,859
up

936
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,560
so again me but together with me help

937
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,400
from Technical University of clinic so

938
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
she said I have to say something

939
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,680
well you know the situation yes uh it's

940
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,119
15th October

941
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,400
the last deadline is over

942
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,099
and you don't know what to do and where

943
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,099
to push your PhD students huh and that's

944
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,800
a situation we want to help you out and

945
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,680
so we set the deadline for the crusade

946
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,859
in Munich this next year next year next

947
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:59,700
year to 28th of November for a moment

948
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,260
so

949
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,460
that will be in Munich beautiful Munich

950
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,980
I mean it's not just possible it's you

951
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,359
know because it's so great

952
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,780
so I could tell you mention I think why

953
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,000
to go there but there are many people

954
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,680
here in the room just coming from Munich

955
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,680
so just maybe show up who's in Munich

956
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,339
wait

957
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,140
don't be shy

958
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,579
so you see there are sufficient people

959
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,980
just go to them ask them why to go to

960
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,660
Munich yeah

961
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,940
yeah and maybe also spring beard Fest

962
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,820
around that time so maybe you catch at

963
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,680
least there will be some beer there will

964
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,919
definitely be

965
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,859
so maybe even

966
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,940
thank you

967
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,079
so

968
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:55,680
um

969
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,140
I have a friend by the name of Peter

970
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,640
Schwab

971
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,020
and yesterday he approached me and said

972
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm really short of drum session talks

973
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,119
give me something funny

974
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,220
or maybe he didn't actually say that but

975
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,299
but pretty much

976
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,980
and I said okay I'll come up with

977
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,859
something and this is what I'm giving

978
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,660
him

979
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,780
and what I'm giving you guys

980
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,900
for those who are at all or interested

981
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,740
in those things like you know MPC

982
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,359
and all that

983
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,320
you would love Asia Crypt 2022 and it's

984
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,400
going to be in Taipei

985
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:45,020
I mean we have some of the best places

986
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,740
we have very nice food

987
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,859
and one of my employees wants to make

988
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,819
this announcement

989
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,209
[Laughter]

990
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,900
you know when I took one of my friends

991
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,060
out for seafood

992
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,000
like a shrimp actually left off the

993
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,800
plate trying to get away

994
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,380
actually maybe not necessarily the

995
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,680
always the best food but I would say on

996
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,540
average we have the best safe point

997
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,160
and if you are into hiking we have some

998
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,599
of the best heroes to climb

999
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,560
so please those who like Taiwan come to

1000
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,720
Asia Crypt and if you don't like Taiwan

1001
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,220
you will like it after you come

1002
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,140
thank you very much and maybe just

1003
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,700
before the break let me add to this

1004
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,619
brilliant talk that also you'll be

1005
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,119
allowed to drink during the rum session

1006
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,060
so um

1007
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,020
so with this we go for a break I would

1008
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,480
say until quarter past so that really

1009
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,859
everybody has enough time to get enough

1010
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,140
drinks and then we we start with the

1011
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,119
second half

1012
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,480
before you leave before you leave you

1013
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,040
know I didn't see you brought the

1014
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,380
glasses and the bottles inside it's not

1015
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,680
allowed please let me not see them lie

1016
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,900
here after you leave otherwise I have to

1017
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,520
go and pick them up you don't want this

1018
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,920
to do it for me right

1019
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,140
don't leave anything here which should

1020
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,859
not belong here

1021
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,240
all right

1022
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,420
okay

1023
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,099
[Music]

1024
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,440
so we have Firefox here it's yeah okay

1025
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,819
it doesn't matter

1026
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:31,380
okay sure so it's some groups

1027
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,440
um

1028
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,619
and then for one three three uh

1029
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,859
foreign

1030
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,890
[Music]

1031
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,130
[Music]

1032
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,180
foreign

1033
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,500
right there

1034
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,680
foreign

1035
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,000
all right

1036
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,219
welcome back everyone

1037
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,679
to the second half of the one session of

1038
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,899
Chess 2022

1039
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,698
it was a short moment until everybody

1040
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:27,120
found a seat and hit that rings

1041
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,318
and um

1042
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,198
all right not silent perfect and now

1043
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:35,939
it's my pleasure to hand over the floor

1044
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,859
to our first Speaker of the second half

1045
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:40,140
Thomas

1046
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,859
thank you

1047
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,759
so yeah the the title of this talk will

1048
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,500
be crypto Ai and I would like to take

1049
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,759
you on a journey

1050
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:54,540
I took so this is my AI Journey as an

1051
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,040
Hardware engineer

1052
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,340
um it was end of 2021 so this is all

1053
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,160
outdated by AI standards yeah it's one

1054
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,199
year old basically

1055
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,000
completely outdated but there was the

1056
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,440
covet lockdown

1057
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,060
um and then we thought that the NIS

1058
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,640
competition was about to end um uh and

1059
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,320
uh and I was thinking okay and this

1060
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,699
competition is ending you hope it's

1061
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,140
getting kicked out

1062
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,480
I need a new skill I need to get into

1063
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,880
something new I I cannot continue with

1064
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,080
this post Quantum stuff and then

1065
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,659
everybody's talking about AI okay so

1066
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,320
what do you do

1067
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,300
somehow I have to get into this topic so

1068
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,280
I played around a bit and uh and there's

1069
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,380
a model which is which is called gpt2

1070
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,080
and can tell a lot about a lot of

1071
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,420
stories about unicorns so it's a text

1072
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,040
completion model

1073
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,800
um you can enter a text here in bold

1074
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,780
um in a shocking finding scientists

1075
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,699
discovered a herd of unicorns living in

1076
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:50,159
a remote previously unexplored Valley in

1077
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,800
the endless mountains even more

1078
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,239
surprisingly to the researchers was that

1079
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,920
the fact that the unicorns were perfect

1080
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,620
English and then this AI model it will

1081
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:01,199
just continue the story and it's super

1082
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,719
nice you can play with it it will tell

1083
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:06,060
you a lot of stories about unicorns here

1084
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,440
it tells you the stories that

1085
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,239
researchers have found the mysterious

1086
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:12,300
rare and endangered Indian unicorn also

1087
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,480
known as the Llama Antelope horse which

1088
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,640
is living in a remote Valley

1089
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,080
um but then the next question was okay

1090
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,880
this is nice um

1091
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,460
everybody loves unicorns but what does

1092
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,380
this thing know about crypto

1093
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,480
and then the thing is

1094
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,600
I think it was basically trained on the

1095
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,980
internet

1096
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,920
and the internet is

1097
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,940
somehow full of Bitcoin and Quantum and

1098
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,739
this happens if you enter post Quantum

1099
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:42,719
crypto and then it asks about Bitcoin

1100
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,460
and the idea of quantum crypto systems

1101
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,199
like Quantum pointing pre-distribution

1102
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,960
the quantum resistor and that is not new

1103
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,820
crypto and security and I was like okay

1104
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,800
what what's going on here yeah this is

1105
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,500
this is stupid we need something better

1106
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,320
so I got into this and um I played

1107
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,320
around with this um and also word of

1108
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,140
warning from my side these AIS

1109
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,060
can really suck you in

1110
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,460
so um I was playing with it my

1111
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,080
girlfriend was coming home from from

1112
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,420
getting a haircut I was getting out of

1113
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,760
the room or smiling she was expecting a

1114
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,770
compliment and I was it can talk yeah

1115
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:22,140
[Laughter]

1116
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,120
yeah you have to see it it's so smart

1117
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,280
and yeah this obviously was not so well

1118
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,140
received don't do this

1119
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,540
um and yeah what can you do so the model

1120
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,460
is is kind of smart because it was

1121
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,080
trained on the internet and it can

1122
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,420
understand English English but it can

1123
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,640
also be fine-tuned and so I thought okay

1124
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,080
how can I find through it I played

1125
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,360
around with it a bit so um I started

1126
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,040
with a model that can generate ircr

1127
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,500
fellows but this kind of boring and

1128
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,120
there are not too many of them and then

1129
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,679
I thought okay maybe ePrint is a good

1130
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,900
source so what you can do is or what I

1131
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,520
did I just downloaded all the abstracts

1132
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,040
from ePrint 1969 uh to end off

1133
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,440
2021 and then you can just fine tune the

1134
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,219
stuff

1135
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:05,400
um in Google collab really easy thanks a

1136
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,960
lot to Google for for making graphic

1137
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,520
cards available

1138
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,560
um and then I I yeah had the model and I

1139
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,420
put it into the cloud um there's a very

1140
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,120
nice very fast implementation

1141
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,340
um and I always wanted to dabble a bit

1142
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,500
with JavaScript and fast API and all

1143
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,940
this new stuff because the last time I

1144
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,040
did web development there was PHP and

1145
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,640
and like static HTML pages and um yeah

1146
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,460
never never bet to learn something new

1147
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,699
and um yeah this is what what came out

1148
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,020
of this

1149
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,780
and I'm I'm doing a live demo here so

1150
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,340
this is the the crypto abstract

1151
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,199
generator and what you can put into it

1152
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:43,140
is a title and an abstract and it will

1153
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,420
then continue and will write the

1154
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,440
abstract for you and um

1155
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,900
so I will I would like you to yeah to

1156
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,480
enjoy this um and I I will also give you

1157
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,179
the link later and um so what you can do

1158
01:13:57,179 --> 01:14:00,679
you can just let it write an abstract

1159
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,120
so here on new frequency records for F0

1160
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,500
in this article we give some new

1161
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,900
frequency reactors for F0 with new names

1162
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:16,159
but now I got a bit stuck

1163
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:21,719
but of course we can also we can also

1164
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:24,000
give it a hint what we want to see so

1165
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,560
something obviously

1166
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,239
um so this paper should definitely be

1167
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:29,159
written

1168
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:31,260
see them New Hope is better and we can

1169
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,219
just let yeah I do it

1170
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,139
I can shoot against this

1171
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,659
so yeah

1172
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,520
seems legit

1173
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,620
and maybe maybe in this made a terrible

1174
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:52,099
mistake

1175
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,760
and then um what I also discovered is um

1176
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,760
di the AI learns

1177
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,400
so it also noticed ah there are these

1178
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,500
dollar signs and stuff like that in a

1179
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,679
paper

1180
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,440
and if the title has a formula then

1181
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,080
probably the abstract should have two

1182
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,080
laughs

1183
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,739
so we can apply the markup I think come

1184
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:24,179
on make sure

1185
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:27,560
oh yeah here it is

1186
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,159
so and maybe to wrap up um maybe we can

1187
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,560
do something nice maybe Peter give me a

1188
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,120
keyword

1189
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,920
well I would go with side channels here

1190
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,280
chess

1191
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,080
let's get inspired

1192
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,400
watching

1193
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:17,580
so the model is really good on

1194
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,739
blockchain stuff because

1195
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:22,560
it was trade on the internet and then it

1196
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,719
was made really smart smart with all the

1197
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,960
knowledge of ircr ePrint but it returned

1198
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,120
some of this blockchain knowledge and

1199
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,400
then for for it crypto is still

1200
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,199
blockchain

1201
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:38,699
um so yeah this uh this is um

1202
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,340
my contribution to the ram session and

1203
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,960
um there's of course also now the

1204
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,659
question what would be what would be um

1205
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:49,500
future work what can we do with this

1206
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,480
um of course we could build and we could

1207
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,179
build a game

1208
01:16:53,179 --> 01:16:58,679
identify AI generated versus ePrint

1209
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,440
and I have this here so this is a paper

1210
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,920
that one of the uh one of the chairs

1211
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,440
wrote and um

1212
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,860
I would like you to vote which one is

1213
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,280
the real

1214
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,040
it wasn't me

1215
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,580
yeah the left one is the correct

1216
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,400
so so this might be a nice game to do

1217
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,760
and then um of course there's also the

1218
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,560
challenge to the audience uh generate an

1219
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,719
abstract get inspired write the paper

1220
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,239
and then get it accepted I will knock

1221
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,040
that

1222
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,800
and um of course this this approach can

1223
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,940
be extended

1224
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:47,460
um so for example one thing that I

1225
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,679
thought of is just training a model for

1226
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,420
a single offer

1227
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,179
but of course we need data um on the

1228
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:55,620
other hand I think Army would be a good

1229
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,540
Target with all his papers yeah I think

1230
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,960
we can make an AI out of out of his work

1231
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,360
um we could also do maybe an AI that

1232
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,739
does the flame war on the nist mainly

1233
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:08,340
list for us um I I tried a bit but

1234
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,960
so far the results were just

1235
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,640
incomprehensible

1236
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,020
um

1237
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,000
and what you could also do is maybe an

1238
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,620
AI issue in the Journal of cryptology

1239
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,960
training AI to write abstracts training

1240
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,199
to review them and then train an AI to

1241
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,699
give the talk on YouTube and it would be

1242
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,500
beautiful yeah the whole thing would

1243
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,120
just work

1244
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,640
without human intervention and we could

1245
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,400
have coffee and beer and um yeah if you

1246
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,840
want to play around with this this is at

1247
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,020
cryptan.com at the Port 1337 it's

1248
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,400
running in the cloud but clouds are

1249
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,320
expensive um the server may get

1250
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,719
overloaded I'm working on it probably

1251
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,219
try a bit later

1252
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,699
um and I hope it survives it and um yeah

1253
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,980
with this let's hope the AI is wrong in

1254
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,540
the end because I asked it about the end

1255
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,820
of crypto and basically the answer was

1256
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,440
that cryptographers are dying and will

1257
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,000
be replaced by Machine learning in our

1258
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,159
lifetime

1259
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,260
so thank you for your attention and have

1260
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,440
fun

1261
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,199
yeah

1262
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,060
so after this important contribution to

1263
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,940
the field of cryptology it's going to be

1264
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:23,400
Gustavo who has the challenge of taking

1265
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,920
the next slot in the swamp session yeah

1266
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,780
it's a little bit hard but at least I

1267
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,340
will try to enjoy for some people so

1268
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,560
just say AI

1269
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,080
yeah

1270
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,400
I'm going to say a lot during the talk

1271
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,219
even having no relation with it just to

1272
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:40,380
you guys to be drunk sir

1273
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,219
um

1274
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:44,340
okay so this is like the exogenic club

1275
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:46,199
um the the original it's Jonathan and

1276
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:49,380
Kyrene they're like uh creating this

1277
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,960
um misogyny club which is the first rule

1278
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,280
we should not talk about but we're

1279
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,540
talking about

1280
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,460
and uh since they don't care about like

1281
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,199
implementations I was like they are not

1282
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:58,920
here

1283
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,320
and then I was like hey they want me to

1284
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,840
sponsor this they're like yeah go ahead

1285
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,060
I was like thank you can I make it fun

1286
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:10,699
you can try no AI

1287
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,580
so

1288
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,380
so then I mean the question is if you're

1289
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,480
like on Twitter you know that a surgeon

1290
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,840
is might be dead especially after some

1291
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,699
Belgian people uh

1292
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:25,679
just attack them

1293
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,020
so but

1294
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,900
yeah I am moving to it there's one tag

1295
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,520
like stop like because there is the

1296
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,199
first paper and then the second paper

1297
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:36,239
and someone like we can just start it

1298
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,540
from random curves nope you cannot

1299
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,760
but the thing is this is the surgeon is

1300
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,020
really bad AI

1301
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,239
um in fact not today we still have like

1302
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,179
some um things to break if you want if

1303
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,040
you're a Belgian we can we well we have

1304
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,199
like the next weekend coming up so you

1305
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,560
can just uh attack this and then well

1306
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,080
you have a nice publication

1307
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,300
but if you are not like in the attacking

1308
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,739
side or you are in the attacking side

1309
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,679
you can drive there um misogyny Club

1310
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,179
it's uh oh wait AI

1311
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,739
um so it's the it's such a club it's a

1312
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:19,140
directly virtual seminar so you can just

1313
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,719
even use as a background noise like for

1314
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:24,239
example you're like doing some let's say

1315
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:27,840
challenge during your conference AI

1316
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,600
um and then if you really wanted you

1317
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,440
just reach them by um email you can

1318
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,659
follow them on Twitter they even have

1319
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,760
early can a really nice page which is

1320
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,580
just a static page with the next talks

1321
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:44,400
and they usually have this like on

1322
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,400
well on Zoom so everyone knows those on

1323
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,000
Zoom so it's this so thank you for this

1324
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,980
and AI

1325
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:57,019
and then we have the next one

1326
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,719
all right then next up is gaito

1327
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,040
it was yours thanks so I'm delighted to

1328
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,540
learn that this thought is supposed to

1329
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,760
be funny

1330
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,800
so to be more funny it will be very

1331
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,920
serious uh there will be no AI there so

1332
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,739
no crop topology we'll just speak about

1333
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:25,020
or just artifact that many of you

1334
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,060
submitted this year

1335
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,860
um so this project that you launched

1336
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,000
with some

1337
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,060
um people from UCLA University but that

1338
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,620
we would like to open to anybody here

1339
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:37,380
the fact that when you write a nice

1340
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,719
paper to chess maybe people want to use

1341
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:41,940
it you wrote very nice code but nobody

1342
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,560
can understand it because of course you

1343
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,360
run the code for yourself and not for

1344
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,520
anybody else even if it's for an

1345
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,640
artifacts we all know that so maybe

1346
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,040
today we could do something better for

1347
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,820
that

1348
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,400
just like uh open assistant or kidney

1349
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,760
liberalism uh maybe better than openssl

1350
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,640
and do some things they use about uh

1351
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,679
embedded implementation for cryptography

1352
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,179
that we could share among this whole

1353
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,140
community

1354
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,100
so our projects uh is try to gather open

1355
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,960
source implementation high quality ones

1356
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,300
that you can use in real Industrial

1357
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,900
Products or made products if you want to

1358
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,300
um and the idea would be to make it done

1359
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,100
by the people who know that the best to

1360
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,540
achieve the best security that is the

1361
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,460
researchers but of course we all know

1362
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,840
that researchers

1363
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,719
end of PhD PhD student postdocs and so

1364
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,120
on are not always the best as at writing

1365
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,820
industrial quality code so the idea is

1366
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,640
to make a kind of clearing by starting a

1367
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,880
non-profits foundation that would fund

1368
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,100
researchers to write industry quality

1369
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,280
code for their scientific contributions

1370
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,560
um so that's one of the proposals and

1371
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,000
the other proposal is to be able to

1372
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,760
train all the people to use that code

1373
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,719
uh so how could we do that uh first

1374
01:23:57,719 --> 01:23:59,760
gather help from the community to

1375
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,159
identify what could be cool and

1376
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:05,580
interesting contribution uh to do maybe

1377
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:09,120
ask AI to do it uh issue or the fight is

1378
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,940
then you ask a very senior scientific

1379
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,760
Council to to validate these decisions

1380
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,800
then you try to find someone who wants

1381
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,620
to work on this uh hiring from an

1382
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:22,560
internship uh try to gather good

1383
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,719
supervision and guidelines for high

1384
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,219
quality implementations

1385
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:28,920
you make it open source everybody likes

1386
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,300
a challenge so you can challenge and

1387
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,739
break it

1388
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:33,360
or improve it

1389
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,060
and then finally uh we need some people

1390
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,219
to to fund all of this so we will look

1391
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,800
for sponsors who will pay for the

1392
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,360
internship but then receive like

1393
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,860
permissive license and then in the end

1394
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,940
we will want to maintain these

1395
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,260
implementations if people are interested

1396
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,300
so these are all super nice project but

1397
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,320
concretely

1398
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,380
uh what are we doing now so we have in

1399
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:01,140
the works uh start project which is a

1400
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,060
higher order mask as implementation

1401
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,080
Hardware

1402
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,900
stay tuned for CTF coming soon

1403
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,760
we have a side Channel evaluation

1404
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,100
Library we want it to be efficient

1405
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,500
usable and so on this is already online

1406
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,480
full documentation you can look at it

1407
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,218
and we also have a poster somewhere

1408
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,360
and then in the longer term we look for

1409
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,460
other project proposal sponsors that's

1410
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,480
already know

1411
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,880
and we will try to put together a

1412
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,739
training on all of these topics for

1413
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:31,199
people to use the implementations

1414
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,820
so thank you for listening don't

1415
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,760
hesitate to school and talk to us so to

1416
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,880
me or either look at our websites uh

1417
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,580
there will be some knowledge soon thank

1418
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,699
you

1419
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,679
all right and the next talk is about

1420
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:54,840
beep beep

1421
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,440
hi uh I'm shahram and unfortunately I

1422
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,580
don't know how to make full

1423
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,940
presentations I'm just here to

1424
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:06,000
announce our recent design it's it's it

1425
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,820
shouldn't work with uh JanSport and Juan

1426
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,860
Damon from Bad Val and Christopher

1427
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,219
Browning and santoshkosh from intellect

1428
01:26:13,219 --> 01:26:18,420
studently Intel uh introduced uh CQ it's

1429
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,780
a Memory cell mechanism and it is used

1430
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,420
for preventing some of uh physical

1431
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:28,199
attacks on uh CPU architectures and it

1432
01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:31,760
heavily relies on uh ultra low latency

1433
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,500
cryptographic Primitives such as a to

1434
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,320
equal life cycle with special

1435
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:40,800
requirements it has uh 24 bits of block

1436
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,840
size

1437
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,480
40 bits of Twix size and more especially

1438
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,900
it has to provide decryption in uh two

1439
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,659
or three cycles of

1440
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:53,760
four to five gigahertz and Intel

1441
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,900
technology

1442
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,840
uh these requirements makes this design

1443
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,960
very challenging because uh with all

1444
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,540
these restrictions it has to provide a

1445
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:07,080
cryptography cryptographic Security in

1446
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,900
the same level as a typical tweakable

1447
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,080
black ciphers and uh we accept this

1448
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,020
Challenge and designed with it its name

1449
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,060
is taken from this uh

1450
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,980
character that you may know from the

1451
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:24,060
cartoon PP pancotti it's General is its

1452
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,639
generally structure is shown in this

1453
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,460
picture it has 11 rounds in a data pass

1454
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,380
and

1455
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:35,219
there are three children followed by

1456
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:36,900
five four runs and then you can see

1457
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,600
shell runs it uses a

1458
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,500
12 round Keys which is derived from a

1459
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,460
master key of 20 uh 256 bits and under

1460
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,540
tweak

1461
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:52,320
uh in the in the data pass rounds we use

1462
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,980
uh s-boxes

1463
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:01,280
which is uh

1464
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,679
shown in this picture it has it it is

1465
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:07,380
possible to be implemented in uh gate

1466
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:10,560
set support uh in the basis of two bit

1467
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,320
nands or north and depending on your

1468
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,020
library you can make it more simple

1469
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,440
uh for diffusion we use a different type

1470
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,520
of linear layers uh which can be a bit

1471
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,739
different patient in the Shell rounds or

1472
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:29,360
in the current we use uh

1473
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,219
ixor of three bits for each output bit

1474
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:36,239
and in The Tweak pass round we use uh 53

1475
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:39,120
bits of estate size it's based on a

1476
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,100
sheet function of the same size and

1477
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,400
again linear layer can be dependent uh

1478
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,540
different depending on the run time

1479
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:53,159
we claim it has a 90 96 bits of security

1480
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:54,840
uh

1481
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,340
in all of these adversary models and

1482
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,739
this claim is based on an extensive

1483
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:05,520
crypto analysis using most known attacks

1484
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,400
and also we use some customized attacks

1485
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,659
for small size block ciphers and we also

1486
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:15,300
verified the micro Cipher's Market

1487
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,300
Cipher's Theory be implemented in the

1488
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,460
unrolled architecture it can be

1489
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,780
implemented in about a latency of 6

1490
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,219
600 pickle seconds in the Intel 10

1491
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:31,620
nanometer technology technology and

1492
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,600
Independence in the pipeline

1493
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,239
architecture which will be the use case

1494
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,820
it can be implemented in three cycles of

1495
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,159
4.5 gigahertz

1496
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:43,199
uh finally we are looking for some

1497
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,780
qualities to catch a BP if you are

1498
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,199
interested uh please uh have a look on

1499
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,900
it and if you can capitalize it we are

1500
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,040
looking forward thank you

1501
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,280
thank you and now we will learn how to

1502
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,239
break RSA

1503
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,980
space space key just space okay hi

1504
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,139
everyone I was hoping to get the first

1505
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:15,960
slot in this session because I have one

1506
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,080
of the very few serious topics here but

1507
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,940
this is about a topic that was really

1508
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,159
surprising to us when we discovered this

1509
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,440
last year and I'm trusting that despite

1510
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,000
the wine and the beer there's still

1511
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,100
enough scientists in you to enjoy this

1512
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,120
topic

1513
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,540
so it's about brute forcing private RSA

1514
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,239
keys now with side Channel attacks

1515
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:39,120
typically one recovers a part of the key

1516
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,460
but not always everything and the figure

1517
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,860
here shows that in a graph you can

1518
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,840
immediately see the bits that are

1519
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,820
probably a zero and the bits that are

1520
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:49,620
probably a one but there's always this

1521
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,020
middle section and this can be a lot

1522
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,120
more than you can actually Brute Force

1523
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,520
so the big question is how do we find

1524
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,080
the missing bits

1525
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,080
and there's existing methods but these

1526
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,020
require missing bits to be groups for

1527
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,080
instance all in the left key half so

1528
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,080
when we try to do brute forcing we run

1529
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,880
into the problem that RSA is a

1530
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,920
relatively slow algorithm and typically

1531
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,800
a a full private key operation takes

1532
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,659
about a milliseconds on standard

1533
01:31:18,659 --> 01:31:20,760
Hardware so that means that brute

1534
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,159
forcing more than 30 bits becomes

1535
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:26,100
Troublesome and a high degree of leaking

1536
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,440
leakage confidence is needed to complete

1537
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,940
the attack

1538
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:32,940
so how do we solve this

1539
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,320
um and there's a couple of formulas here

1540
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,540
so I hope you can still stand with me so

1541
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,060
there's three steps the first and second

1542
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,460
step you do that once and the third step

1543
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:44,159
you're gonna repeat endlessly so first

1544
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,880
you initialize your crypto you have a a

1545
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,679
public key and a private key you don't

1546
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,440
know the private exponent D but you do

1547
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,260
know the modulus n and the private the

1548
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,020
public exponent e so you choose a

1549
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,540
signature s and then you compute message

1550
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,960
M as s to the power e mod M and of

1551
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,840
course uh s can be recomputed if you

1552
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,900
knew the private exponent but we don't

1553
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,699
so the next thing that we're going to do

1554
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:14,820
is to prepare a signature table and what

1555
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:17,219
we'll do is to compute signatures for

1556
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:20,820
consecutive values of D without knowing

1557
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,020
the how can we do that so the first

1558
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:27,960
signature that we compute is S1 which is

1559
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,960
m to the power D plus one which is

1560
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,340
actually equal to S times s mod n and

1561
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,380
that is a value that we have so we can

1562
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:40,199
actually compute as one we can also

1563
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:42,719
compute S2 and we can continue doing

1564
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,639
that so we can create a very big table

1565
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:47,280
with consecutive signatures

1566
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:51,600
for consecutive uh private exponent

1567
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,060
values even while we don't know the

1568
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,920
private exponent yet

1569
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,739
so this is a step we do only once and

1570
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,360
then we start the enumeration process

1571
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,360
which can be repeated billions of times

1572
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,940
so we generate candidate values D Prime

1573
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,940
for the private exponent D that we don't

1574
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,820
know and here we enumerate the most

1575
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,500
significant bits

1576
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,080
and we set the least significant bits to

1577
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,679
all two ones okay then we compute S

1578
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,400
Prime as m to the power V Prime mod n

1579
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,500
and we're going to check whether S Prime

1580
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,380
T equals any value in the signature in

1581
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,699
the signature table

1582
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:32,940
if it does in case of a match with the

1583
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,460
signature at position I we actually

1584
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,040
learn the correct value of the private

1585
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:42,780
exponent d as D Prime minus I so this is

1586
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,420
a a process that will make the brute

1587
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,820
forcing much easier so we replace the

1588
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,880
exhaustive key testing by table lookups

1589
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,980
and The Brute Force problem is now

1590
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:55,139
reduced with the table size

1591
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:57,239
and with some additional tricks we can

1592
01:33:57,239 --> 01:34:00,060
now Brute Force up to 70 randomly

1593
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,520
distributed bits just instead that

1594
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,300
Hardware

1595
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,460
with a more advanced computer we can do

1596
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,620
more with 70 bits is already quite

1597
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,820
impressive

1598
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:11,400
now before I walk off um there's one

1599
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,260
little secret I wanted to share with you

1600
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,840
probably only very few of you know that

1601
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,739
already

1602
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:19,139
behind this Auditorium there's an

1603
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:22,080
exposition space where the sponsors are

1604
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,300
showing their demos and knowledge their

1605
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,800
wisdom

1606
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,500
um only very few know that because today

1607
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,600
I've seen maybe a dozen of you over

1608
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,420
there so I'm gonna invite all of you to

1609
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:35,400
come over to tomorrow during the coffee

1610
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,980
breaks and with every coffee break the

1611
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,260
first person to visit our booze will get

1612
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:42,360
this book this is the hardware hacking

1613
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:45,239
handbook written by Colin and Jasper

1614
01:34:45,239 --> 01:34:48,199
thank you

leakage elected Victor

1617
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,780
hi everybody

1618
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,460
so our

1619
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,040
when I present humor I like my last

1620
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,780
research works that I made on Saturday

1621
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:12,960
on the train for 11. called title

1622
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,699
attacks and bread

1623
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:17,280
so what's the starting point it's this

1624
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,860
famous work from Daniel jenking and Al

1625
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,320
called the pita bread attack

1626
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,080
and actually what's the what is the

1627
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,800
attack so UI reportable electromatic

1628
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,139
sectional attack setup in a pita bread

1629
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:33,840
you bring your pita bread to a meeting

1630
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,659
where your victim is attending and you

1631
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:38,400
put the pita bread in the middle of the

1632
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,659
meeting table

1633
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:41,760
so you send an encrypted email to your

1634
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:42,780
victim

1635
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,000
uh you and then you record the EM

1636
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,040
activity of the victim's laptop during

1637
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,980
email decryption and so you analyze the

1638
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,739
sea traces and x-ray a resale private

1639
01:35:52,739 --> 01:35:54,719
key so you can use pictures from

1640
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,880
original article

1641
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,219
but what is the main uh attack

1642
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:01,679
requirements you have to be in a region

1643
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,940
of the world

1644
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,159
well it's normal to bring a picture pita

1645
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:06,719
bread to a meeting

1646
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,380
and from Wikipedia Peter bread is common

1647
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:12,179
in Mediterranean Middle East and

1648
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:14,340
neighboring area so what about other

1649
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,380
places in the world

1650
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,600
so that's the first contribution of my

1651
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,500
work

1652
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,780
how to adapt the intro attack scenario

1653
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,300
to other places in the world so let's

1654
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:28,380
from Studio civil use cases first India

1655
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,300
what's the most famous bird in India

1656
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,239
it's none huh it's really good

1657
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:37,820
so the the drinking at all

1658
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,520
so it's okay the attack scales to India

1659
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,739
so let's move to Poland

1660
01:36:43,739 --> 01:36:45,840
what's the most famous branded Poland

1661
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,679
it's bugger and once again the the SDs

1662
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,500
that fits in the bagel bread just take a

1663
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:55,080
question about the bagel ore

1664
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,179
and so the attacks came to Poland and

1665
01:36:57,179 --> 01:37:00,320
it's also work in New York

1666
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,239
next use case Mexico

1667
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:07,199
so Mexico tortilla and tortilla is like

1668
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,199
Cinema but it can fit so the attack also

1669
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,880
scales to Mexico

1670
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,460
another use case Italy

1671
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:17,840
Italy your several choices

1672
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:20,159
okay it works

1673
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,900
and then

1674
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,260
friends huh what's the most famous word

1675
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:27,060
is France it's a baguette it's a French

1676
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,940
baguette and it doesn't fit the you know

1677
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:32,580
the antenna doesn't fit in the French

1678
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,920
baguette so it doesn't work in France

1679
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,520
so second contribution of his work you

1680
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,860
know you know that any uh SC attack

1681
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:42,960
paper should always propose the contamin

1682
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,239
zero huh right like you're proposing

1683
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:48,000
your attack so a new solution

1684
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,179
so new contingency for the for this

1685
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:53,460
attack is like organizing meetings in

1686
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,100
France and you refuse any attendee with

1687
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,320
non-local bread so it's the only

1688
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,219
baguette meetings

1689
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,840
so yes thanks for attention and if you

1690
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,060
have any question go to the toilets

1691
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,440
battery

1692
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,040
foreign

1693
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,280
thank you very much

1694
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,699
now Mike

1695
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:24,420
take the mic continuing the uh trend of

1696
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,120
non-funny talks in the funny section

1697
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,580
um so glow stick so this is a a toy

1698
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,320
algorithm

1699
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,440
um that uh the goal is to to take these

1700
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,900
lattice chems and then see how small can

1701
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,639
you possibly make them if you throw away

1702
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,040
you know all requirements other than

1703
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,800
size right so CCA security we don't need

1704
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,040
this uh high speed we don't need this uh

1705
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,840
side Channel even the requirement that

1706
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,460
it actually works we throw away it's

1707
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,340
allowed to fail you know a few times in

1708
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,199
a million because uh we're just gonna

1709
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,480
bolt this to TLS so you can uh you can

1710
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,040
try again

1711
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,320
um so

1712
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,600
um uh this you know you could imagine

1713
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,040
deploying this as a countermeasure

1714
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,380
against uh like store into grip later or

1715
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,880
somebody having a surprise quantum

1716
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,139
computer and you want to make this a

1717
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:11,219
little bit harder for them but we're

1718
01:39:11,219 --> 01:39:13,500
imagining this is hybridized with ECC or

1719
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,699
something right

1720
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,380
um and the goal here is to develop ideas

1721
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:18,659
that could be used for uh Real World

1722
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:20,639
Systems eventually not to actually it's

1723
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,560
self be a real world system so how do

1724
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,679
you do uh one of these chems right so uh

1725
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,719
you have a ring and then

1726
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:29,820
um uh there's a random element a in the

1727
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,600
ring

1728
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,760
um Alice and Bob have small values s and

1729
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,560
t they send each other as and a t

1730
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,179
rounded and then they both can compute

1731
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:38,100
AST right

1732
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,679
um so just stepping through what uh I

1733
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:42,120
ended up finding for the smallest

1734
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,400
possible things here so R is the entry

1735
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,920
ring thanks to the round five team for

1736
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,020
discussions on this

1737
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:50,040
um

1738
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,679
uh the secret is a fixed weight ternary

1739
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:55,199
or possibly some other fixed weight

1740
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,060
um thing that maximizes entropy usually

1741
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,040
that's ternary

1742
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,280
um uh instead of sending a seed well

1743
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,719
you're insane if you want to try to use

1744
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:05,219
something like this without hybridizing

1745
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:07,380
it with something classical so this is

1746
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,719
just Alice's ephemeral ECC key is also

1747
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:11,580
the seed

1748
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,300
um

1749
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,159
there's a problem with entry rings that

1750
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:16,380
you can evaluate at one

1751
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,199
um so we'll just mix that by uh setting

1752
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:22,679
a so that it evaluates to zero at one

1753
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:24,239
um and then that property also carries

1754
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:28,080
over to as so as if one is also zero and

1755
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,760
so you can round it so that it's still

1756
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,380
zero

1757
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,560
um and then you've uh you know avoided

1758
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,900
uh avoided that problem

1759
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,639
um but then the the real key is how do

1760
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:39,960
you do the reconciliation right because

1761
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,239
the better reconciliation you can do the

1762
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,980
more noise you can tolerate the more you

1763
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,540
can round everything before all of this

1764
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:46,980
falls apart

1765
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,380
um and of course the more you more bits

1766
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,880
you round off of these messages the

1767
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,040
fewer you actually have to send and the

1768
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,719
higher security you get so that's the

1769
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:56,340
main lever that you have

1770
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:58,440
um so there's two layers of this

1771
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,420
um so one of them is uh well you just do

1772
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,000
the usual thing of like send uh send the

1773
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,440
second highest bit and then the key is

1774
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:06,960
the highest bit uh maybe you can get a

1775
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,520
little bit extra if you do it in E8

1776
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,000
instead of Z8 but same same idea and

1777
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,580
then uh maybe more importantly you put

1778
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:17,280
on a giant error correcting code

1779
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,679
um so uh this is actually maybe the the

1780
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,480
part that I could use the most help on

1781
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,400
or the where the most Improvement is

1782
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,840
possible maybe

1783
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,880
um which is that ldpc codes and other

1784
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,880
sort of you know Communications noisy

1785
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,380
Channel error correcting codes are a bit

1786
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:33,360
of a Dark Art and uh I'm not a

1787
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,739
practitioner of that art so if somebody

1788
01:41:34,739 --> 01:41:36,179
is

1789
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:39,300
um hit me up uh but so anyway so you uh

1790
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,920
you can then use maximum likelihood

1791
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,800
decoding to find the most likely key uh

1792
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,360
you know Alice finds the most likely key

1793
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,340
given Bob's hints and then what she's

1794
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,840
computed

1795
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:49,500
um

1796
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:52,080
so uh if you go through Martin

1797
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,239
albrecht's estimator to try to find

1798
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,719
parameters for this that uh mostly work

1799
01:41:57,719 --> 01:41:59,060
um then uh there are some like

1800
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:01,860
especially toy instances that are like a

1801
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:04,080
hey break this uh so that we can find

1802
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,480
out you know how how many bits they

1803
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,280
actually are secure

1804
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,199
um and then the the quote unquote

1805
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:12,060
serious instances

1806
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,100
um for class one you can get under half

1807
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:19,440
a kilobyte of uh key plus uh ciphertext

1808
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,840
um so it's uh you know about uh a third

1809
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,540
the size of kyber or something like that

1810
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:28,080
um uh uh and uh

1811
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,580
uh yeah so there's a bunch of

1812
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,920
possibilities that we could uh improve

1813
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,600
on here

1814
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,400
um you know are there attacks against

1815
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,500
this all these insane things that I'm

1816
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,639
doing

1817
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:40,920
um Can Can somebody improve these codes

1818
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,020
uh and like are there other tricks that

1819
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,639
we should use

1820

made sure that he has to walk twice to

1827
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:07,500
the stage

1828
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,139
in the program so there you go stage is

1829
01:43:10,139 --> 01:43:13,020
all yours Hey look it's me again yay I

1830
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,100
really want the prize just give to me

1831
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:23,360
okay yeah okay anyway AI uh

1832
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,199
but who doesn't know why I'm saying yeah

1833
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,420
like like people in the Internet it's

1834
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,040
because there is a group here every time

1835
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,960
that they say AI they needed to drink

1836
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,440
you didn't drink yeah thank you

1837
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,440
okay so

1838
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,639
now it's a little bit more serious

1839
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,159
because we have like this uh big Latin

1840
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:43,679
American but

1841
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,139
um if you don't know Latin Americans we

1842
01:43:46,139 --> 01:43:48,119
are not exactly known to do like uh

1843
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:50,400
crypto so we have like a lot of people

1844
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,560
outside of Latin America which it's

1845
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,600
basically a lot of

1846
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,280
um

1847
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,219
I really like how Peter is running okay

1848
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:01,440
it's it's a beer oh yeah he wants to

1849
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,600
challenge it

1850
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:06,239
okay Peter

1851
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,780
yes

1852
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,239
yeah

1853
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,320
so let's just see

1854
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,960
you drink AI

1855
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,960
nice

1856
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,520
yeah

1857
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,440
so what are we we are like just the

1858
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,739
community of Latin Americans because

1859
01:44:31,739 --> 01:44:34,260
we we Face similar problems everyone

1860
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,840
that it's from like any place in Latin

1861
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,199
America or Caribbean and um usually we

1862
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:43,139
have like this um community that we are

1863
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:46,020
like trying to build to teach people

1864
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:49,139
that it's outside of like um

1865
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:51,840
this area because English it's not our

1866
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,239
main language as you might know because

1867

you play any if you talk with any person

1869
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,199
that it's not from like English speaking

1870
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,239
country and it's from Latin America they

1871
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:05,580
have like a really strong accent accent

1872
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:07,199

thank you

1880
01:45:20,699 --> 01:45:23,840
um and who are we here we are like a PhD

1881
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,820
students post docs Professor researchers

1882
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,980
it's resurgences of nice it's the thing

1883
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:30,420
that we and we're like you don't know if

1884
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:33,179
you're like in Academia or in the in the

1885
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:36,060
industry and you you just do research

1886
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:38,400
um we usually have like a bi-weekly

1887
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,820
meetings again like uh so same thing

1888
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,380
that's before

1889
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:46,380
we sometimes do workshops online because

1890
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,380
it's easier uh and we have like a slack

1891
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,300
if you want to do this just go point

1892
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,639
this and uh you're going to the hours

1893
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:57,000
like usually there is like a lot of um

1894
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,179
conversations and uh translation of the

1895
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:04,800
material to to the like Portuguese or uh

1896
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,900
Spanish

1897
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,940
um and this is who are the people and

1898
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,679
that's why I can stay like longer here

1899
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:12,420
because there is one of these guys which

1900
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,940
is the chair and he's laughing like hey

1901
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,739
I'm laughing

1902
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:18,480
AI

1903
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,340
just to you

1904
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,679
my problems you you mean visas right

1905
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:25,739
yeah for problems I say visas and even

1906
01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:28,020
like sometimes the language it's a it's

1907
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,100
a barrier

1908
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:33,420
so if you if you haven't been in crypto

1909
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,280
um you have seen this same talk with

1910
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,100
like more slides about wizard

1911
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:38,699
um

1912
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:41,340
and then we have much more people we

1913
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,739
have like 80 members so it's 80 members

1914
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:46,320
and we are basically

1915
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:47,280
um

1916
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,460
across the globe we have people here in

1917
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,560
Europe we have people in in New York we

1918
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,139
have people in in us I say that New York

1919
01:46:55,139 --> 01:46:57,360
is different because like uh they have

1920
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,000
like even different brands from the

1921
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,739
previous stock

1922
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:05,100
um so we we try to do something like

1923
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,920
promote this try to inform that students

1924
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,440
they can have like stipends which

1925
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,880
sometimes we don't know that have

1926
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,860
stipends and if you are like from Latin

1927
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,199
America you have no idea sometimes that

1928
01:47:16,199 --> 01:47:17,580
you can travel

1929
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:20,880
so if you are like um watching this or

1930
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,100
if you know someone just please let us

1931
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,500
know and then it's going to be nice

1932
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,780
uh and one more time AI

1933
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,920
um

1934
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,540
and then this is like we have like a

1935
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,119
Twitter account again

1936
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:38,219
um we have a website which is crypto

1937
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:39,780
Latino

1938
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,239

of the Brazilians which is like uh Diego

1950
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,320
Gustavo and well me and Fabio everyone

1951
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,820
needed to speak in English because we

1952
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:14,400
don't speak Spanish so

1953
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,460

1958
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:27,619

1972
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,679
meetings at Georgia Tech

1973
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:21,540
half the time I get stopped at the

1974
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,679
entrance

1975
01:49:22,679 --> 01:49:24,900
why are you here

1976
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,440
because

1977
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,040
so I could join your meetings and

1978
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,880
understand in Spanish

1979
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,800
um so I wanted to start with a serious

1980
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,659
concern there's a lot of focus on

1981
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,219
Quantum Computing and I've said these

1982
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:47,280
comments at dinner and with other folks

1983
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,480
look

1984
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,719
to measure a Quantum bit this is serious

1985
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,880
there's an issue with the Heisenberg

1986
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,460
uncertainty principle which means that

1987
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:59,580
the measurement process disturbs the

1988
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:00,960
quantum state

1989
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:04,199
so look I'm not against post Quantum

1990
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:06,420
crypto I think we should do it and it'll

1991
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:09,719
have a high impact but there's a serious

1992
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,219
issue in the community of quantum

1993
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:13,679
Computing which is noise so I put the

1994
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,760
picture there

1995
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:16,619
and the issue is

1996
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:18,480
you're do they're doing so much to deal

1997
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,760
with noise it's hard to get the actual

1998
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,520
Quantum state so I just put that as a

1999
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,159
canary in the coal mine

2000
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:27,600
um another concern this is partly

2001
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,520
serious

2002
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,860
elliptic curves and weak Keys we know

2003
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,300
with Des there's a bunch of keys you

2004
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:36,540
can't use in Des right are there keys in

2005
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,100
an elliptic curve right because industry

2006
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,480
is moving towards elliptic curves

2007
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,520
because they're much easier to compute

2008
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,980
than RSA but are there a bunch of weak

2009
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:45,360
keys

2010
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,340
now the third comment I wanted to ask

2011
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,739
all of you to talk to me over the next

2012
01:50:49,739 --> 01:50:52,500
few days because if you go back to the

2013
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:53,760
title slide

2014
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,619
I was asked to be the director of the

2015
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:57,900
on-campus master of cyber security for

2016
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,420
cyber physical systems so I had some

2017
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:02,820
meetings and I said okay

2018
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:06,000
what is a master of science degree

2019
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,679
what is a master of arts degree

2020
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,020
traditionally science would be you have

2021
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,880
mathematical models

2022
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,699
that predict the physics or the biology

2023
01:51:14,699 --> 01:51:16,159
or the chemistry

2024
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:19,619
Arts there's no pure mathematical model

2025
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:21,840
it's practice right

2026
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:25,260
master of business being expert in what

2027
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:29,159
works in practice for economics

2028
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:32,100
um I live in Atlanta next to Emory they

2029
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:35,639
have a masters of public health degree

2030
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:36,719
um there's a master of engineering

2031
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,119
degrees some universities are starting

2032
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:41,639
at Georgia Tech we started the master of

2033
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:43,500
cyber security degree so I had a recent

2034
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,580
meeting

2035
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:46,980
and one of the professors said we should

2036
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,860
teach control theory as a core class in

2037
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,139
the Masters of cyber security you know

2038
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:54,179
poll zero notation Etc

2039
01:51:54,179 --> 01:51:56,040
and I said well

2040
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,020
if you're going to include control

2041
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,239
theories of fundamental Concept in cyber

2042
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,580
security and by the way

2043
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,619
um I don't think I think chess has maybe

2044
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:06,480
one paper in control theory over the

2045
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,600
past five ten years so the point is

2046
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,219
maybe I said

2047
01:52:11,219 --> 01:52:13,860
all the electrical engineering courses

2048
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:16,260
and computer science forces

2049
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:17,880
should be considered cyber security

2050
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,199
courses

2051
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,420
so of course no one agreed with that but

2052
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,040
what does it mean to have a masters of

2053
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,360
cyber security this is a serious

2054
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:27,179
question I'm interested in feedback uh

2055
01:52:27,179 --> 01:52:29,280
during this week just come talk to me

2056
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,540
and thank you very much

2057
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:36,380
thank you

2058
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:41,400
for the last talk we need a short moment

2059
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,020
of setup but trust me it's going to be

2060
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:45,440
worth it

2061
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,219
yeah we need help from The Incredibles

2062
01:52:50,219 --> 01:52:54,619
there yeah incredible exactly

2063
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,719
we're just destroying the equipment here

2064
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:00,540
let me let me put this back on yeah

2065
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:05,840
almost like this maybe put back on no

2066
01:53:07,219 --> 01:53:11,840
if you destroyed it I can't fix it

2067
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,619
that's maybe maybe re-fixed okay maybe

2068
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:21,000
yeah but not over here okay good yeah

2069
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,199
you said I bring

2070
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:26,820
yes I'll take that in a second if that's

2071
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:30,780
okay yeah go okay

2072
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:33,560
um so yeah my name is

2073
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:36,179
for short so please join uh the rest of

2074
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:37,920
the world in calling me turn instead of

2075
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,960
the name that's up there

2076
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:43,619
and so I'm from from Kosik at q11 as you

2077
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:47,040
may have seen by the the yellow t-shirts

2078
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,320
um and that means I'm a Yorker

2079
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,679
and that means I get an extra privilege

2080
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:55,320
which is I can take uh something like

2081
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:59,420
this to a an academic conference

2082
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,000
um without having to explain to

2083
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,480
um a confused airport officer like why

2084
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,119
are you bringing your guitar to a chess

2085
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,380
tournament right so

2086
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:22,440
and for this I will get some help from

2087
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:26,100
you get help from me yeah right okay but

2088
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,940
I have some slides first can I yeah okay

2089
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:30,960
all right okay

2090
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,560
foreign

2091
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:43,320
I'm going to play play a silly song but

2092
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,940
I am

2093
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,880
um yeah

2094
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,020
and that's that's

2095
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:51,239
um you know you in the audience are very

2096
01:54:51,239 --> 01:54:53,040
skilled

2097
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,020
um and you're kind of good with the side

2098
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,420
channels and I don't want to reveal

2099
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:01,440
uh what the next sentence in the song is

2100
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,500
so I need to up the game

2101
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,880
um a little bit

2102
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:10,679
so your skills preclude me from

2103
01:55:10,679 --> 01:55:13,980
you know rhyming with differential hour

2104
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,800
analysis because you know with your

2105
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,500
admission expertise you will immediately

2106
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:20,880
know

2107
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,020
um

2108
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,880
you know what I'll what I'll be riding

2109
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,080
with

2110
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,300
so I'll try to keep as much as possible

2111
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,159
secret from you

2112
01:55:29,159 --> 01:55:32,760
but there's one public input and that's

2113
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,340
those two phrases you know if you feel

2114
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:36,540
like it

2115
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,639
maybe you can join maybe not we'll we'll

2116
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:39,659
see

2117
01:55:39,659 --> 01:55:42,420
um and so now the mic Bearer will join

2118
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:43,500
me

2119
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,080
which is fantastic so can you hold it in

2120
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,880

[Music]

2172
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,940
so this was uh the last Talk of the ROM

2173
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:50,520
session which leaves us with a very very

2174
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,679
responsible task namely to hand out the

2175
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:54,659
RSA

2176
02:00:54,659 --> 02:00:57,420
the Run session award

2177
02:00:57,420 --> 02:01:00,440
um do we need to vote

2178
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:04,139
I think I think it's a very tough vote

2179
02:01:04,139 --> 02:01:06,719
so I think actually

2180
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:07,380
um

2181
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:10,760
I I can we just decide this by by

2182
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:13,260
democracy between the two of us yes yeah

2183
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:15,780
I think we can right yeah so

2184
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:19,860
um now well okay so so we do a vote we

2185
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:21,420
do a vote between two things so there

2186
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,219
was two things that really I think stood

2187
02:01:23,219 --> 02:01:27,860
out there was crypto Ai and there was

2188
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,599
insecurity

2189
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:34,280
so this is about clapping

2190
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,960
to say

2191
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:48,239
all right

2192
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:53,659
who is for insecurity to get

2193
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:59,340
[Applause]

2194
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:01,619

2195
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:02,700

[Music]

2197
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:21,659
I should say having this to someone from

2198
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:24,540
Belgium is is kind of ridiculous but

2199
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,460
also it has a there's a real advantage

2200
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:29,040
and it's easy to transform right so

2201
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,630
congratulations

2202

02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:56,119
