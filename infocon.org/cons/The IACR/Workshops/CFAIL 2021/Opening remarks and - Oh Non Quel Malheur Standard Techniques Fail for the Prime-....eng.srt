the third iteration of this conference

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,680
so just for those of you who may not

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,760
have joined one of our previous events

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
uh here's a little brief history uh we

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
launched in 2019 um back in the olden

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
times when we had an in-person event at

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
columbia university uh if if you want

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,120
you can check out our highlight reel

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
from our powerpoint karaoke duel to get

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
a sense of the kind of things we'd like

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
to do and we're able to be in person

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,920
again

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,800
um

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
we also made one major mistake which was

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
our original website had 2019 in the

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,800
donaire mate

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
that was not very forward thinking so we

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,800
fixed that don't go to the old name by

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
the way big mistake checked it out

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,400
yesterday not a place you want to be

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,799
so in 2020 we

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,880
relaunched as an affiliated workshop for

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,000
crypto

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
we went virtual at a more sustainable

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
web address which you can find all the

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,159

um in between the sessions i'm gonna

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
have some trivia questions playing in a

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,119
slideshow um on on the background of the

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
and get your and get your talks ready

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,479
for next year there's plenty of time but

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,079
you want to be careful because you know

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,360
the first few times you might

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
accidentally succeed so you want to make

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,038
sure you know you have you have enough

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,200
time to get those failures in so think

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,239
about that

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,680
um

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
try to make it possible

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
for you to hit both of those things

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
and then we'll be back for uh another

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
two sessions then starting at two

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
o'clock with a 15-minute break in

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
between

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,760
and so that is all that i had for the

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
intro

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
so i'll pass it over to our program

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
chair

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
thank you i actually don't have much to

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
add except that it's great to see the

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,760
attendance here so and to thank

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
everybody for coming and that we have a

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
great program that you've just seen

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
and i think it is customary for the

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
program chair to give some statistics um

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,519
the numbers are actually too small to

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
have something meaningful but still

98
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,879
um

99
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
so we got received nine submissions

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,640
which is a

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
whopping 180

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
increase from last year

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
and of this we accepted six papers

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,560
um

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
and for the first time vc we partnered

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
with the computer journal in order to

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
encourage people to make submissions

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
some of the accepted papers

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
will be invited for to submit a full

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
paper subject to a second round of

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
reviews to the computer journal so out

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
of the six accepted papers

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,160
four will be folded to the journal

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
um and i think at this point i don't

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
have anything more to say so i'll just

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,479
give the flow to tanya which is the

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
chair for the first

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
session um i hope you enjoy the program

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
today

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,919
all right now we get serious here

121
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,600
so

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
the papers which have not failed to get

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,960
into the program

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
it's always interesting to see that

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
people can fail at seafair

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
um so the papers that um we're gonna see

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
today the first one i guess i got the

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,479
challenge of speaking french here

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,280
um let me also say a moment that we have

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
that of course there is a zoom chat but

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
i prefer people asking questions for the

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
for me okay

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
all right thank you

171

javier from universitat

172
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,360
barcelona the title of the talk is

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
standard techniques fail for the prime

174
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,560
order petite evil

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
or a very sad story about how long time

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
ago

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
linear algebra painfully enlightened us

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
and we gave up hope on ever solving a

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
problem

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
and now for the first time we feel

181
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
capable of telling you all about it

182
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,400
so listen carefully

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
the problem

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
like all good work we started with the

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
promise the promise that behind the

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
mountains there is a land of

187
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
sunshine so if we manage to solve this

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
challenging task we would get a very

189
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,319
nice result

190
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
in particular

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,919
in this case we started with

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,599
the work of we whom at tcc

193
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,800
2016 presented an ib encompasses other

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,039
billionaire groups with very nice

195
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
features namely very simple

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,479
efficient meaning short cipher tests and

197
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,360
keys

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
and secure under standard assumptions

199
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
meaning that the assumptions in

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
particular were independent of the

201
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,199
number of

202
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
secret keys queries made by the

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,879
adversary

204
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
also it was anonymous which is a very

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
nice extra features in some applications

206
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
unfortunately composite order bilinear

207
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
groups are inherently inefficient so we

208
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,840
also presented a primordial translation

209
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,759
of this scheme with the same nice

210
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360
features

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
but he couldn't find a security proof

212
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
the key open question that he left open

213
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
is when does a certain complex form of a

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
property called parameter hiding take

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
place

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,520
and

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
unfortunately in this talk we're going

218
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
to give you very sad news

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,319
so we climb the mountains we solve the

220
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,240
challenge to find only barren land

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
we characterize the cases in which

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
parameter hiding solved and

223
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
holds and we show that in fact it's

224
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
quite unlikely that the pre-aim order

225
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
petite ebay

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
can be proven secure under standard

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
assumptions

228
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
more generally we have even worse news

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
we think that the deja q framework of

230
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,519
chase and michael john which

231
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,959
seems to be

232
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,440
who's like is the main technique behind

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
the composite order building

234
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
scheme of wii

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
seems to hard to use in the prime order

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
setting

237
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
so

238
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
i will stop crying and try to tell you

239
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,279
some more details about it

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,839
i will start with proof techniques for

241
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
identity based encryption

242
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
first very quickly since i think you all

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
know this what is identity based

244
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
encryption

245
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,279
well it's a form of encryption where

246
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,720
public keys can be arbitrary strings so

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
why is this useful well this is useful

248
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
because the public keys can be

249
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,240
said to be some certain aspect of the

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
user's identities

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
and

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and this achieves

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,279
implicit certification so a user will

254
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
only be able to decrypt if it receives

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
the master seek

256
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,399
the secret key from some master identity

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
who owns the master secret key so this

258
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
was proposed in by shamir in 1984 and

259
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,920
it's been a very productive line in the

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,279
cryptographic research community

261
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,360
what you need to remember for identity

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,240
based encryption and its security is

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,640
that the main goal is to prove some kind

264
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
of semantic security

265
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
there are generic techniques usually to

266
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
achieve chosen ciphertext um

267
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,680
securities so we focus on

268
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,480
indistinguishability and the tools and

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,920
plain text attacks

270
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
and this is essentially as in standard

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
encryption except that we give the

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
adversary some additional power namely

273
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
we allow the adversary to request secret

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
key ident secret key

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,959
the

276
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
secret keys of

277
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,040
our identities of his choice

278
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,519
and then adaptively choose a certain

279
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
challenge identity

280
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,519
it's also possible to consider other

281
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
more advanced

282
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
security features like anonymity

283
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
where the goal is to choose

284
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
and to decide

285
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,279
um even for whom is a certain cipher

286
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,320
text

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
um this will not be the focus on on this

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,959
work so i will explain

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,839
mostly how to achieve this notion of cpa

290
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,959
security this is not proving in cpa

291
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,240
security for ibe is not a simple thing

292
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,839
the reason is

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
being that this adaptivity so the fact

294
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
that the adversary can choose the

295
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
identity he wants to attack on the fly

296
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,959
this is something that is difficult to

297
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,920
achieve so if you think about it the the

298
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
reduction must be able to answer secret

299
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,760
queries

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
and for any identity and at the same

301
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
time he it must also be able to embed a

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
difficult problem in the cell in cipher

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
text so this is something that is hard

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,079
to

305
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
make uh

306
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,320
come together

307
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
and this is why luke on water suggested

308
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
this dual system proof technique

309
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
the main thing to remember is that keys

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
and cipher text come in two different

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
flavors they are either functional as in

312
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
the real scheme so in the honest

313
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
description of the scheme everything is

314
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
functional or semi-functional and this

315
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
is a feature that only appears in the

316
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
security proof

317
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,639
so i have used in this graphic and

318
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
um green for functional and blue for

319
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
semi-functional and what you need to

320
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
remember is that if i combine something

321
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
that is semi-functional with something

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,240
functional so if i try to if i have a

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
certain ciphertext and i decrypt it with

324
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
a functional key so my vertex is

325
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
has as functional and a semi-functional

326
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
component everything works normally okay

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,279
so

328
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
semi-functional plus function no

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,079
results you you won't notice the

330
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
difference when you decrypt however if

331
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
you match a semi-functional ciphertext

332
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
with a semi-functional key then you will

333
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,279
recover your message plus a binding

334
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,680
some blinding factor i don't really care

335
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,399
is some function of

336
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
which is a function of this uh

337
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,440
the

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
semi-functional component of the

339
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
ciphertext and the semi-functional

340
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,680
component of the secret key

341
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,279
i want uh

342
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
i don't care too much about what is a

343
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
function the point is that um this is

344
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
something that obscure the final the the

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,639
result of decryption

346
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
so how do we use this for proving

347
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
security so in the idea is that in a

348
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
series of games we see we change

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
everything that the adversary sees from

350
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
functional to semi-functional so in

351
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
particular all secret keys that the

352
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
adversary sees are semi-functional and

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
the challenge ciphertext will also be

354
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
semi-functional

355
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
the important thing now is that in the

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
final

357
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
no game we have that all keys

358
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,600
that the adversary it is have a

359
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
semi-functional component and in this

360
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
semi-functional component there is

361
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,079
independent

362
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
randomness okay

363
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,279
so

364
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,160
that

365
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
the blinding factor so

366
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
the the the adversaries has many keys

367
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
and when he if he tries to decrypt the

368
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
challenge ciphertext with the

369
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,079
with the keys that he got he will get

370
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,639
um blinding factors but they will be all

371
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,600
independent so that he cannot really um

372
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
exploit anything um

373
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
so these keys are completely useless and

374
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
it's very easy to to argue at this point

375
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
that the adversary's view is completely

376
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
independent of the encrypted plaintext

377
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
so the fundamental um step that you have

378
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
to remember for this talk is step two so

379
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
the idea that we want to switch

380
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
to a game where all the keys have

381
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
independent randomness in the

382
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
semi-functional space okay

383
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,320
so how does uh we achieve this for

384
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
proving security of his composite or

385
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
repetitive

386
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
so first i have to tell you something

387
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,680
very the basics of composite order

388
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,279
billionaire groups and why they are so

389
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,600
useful as you know a billionaire

390
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,639
um

391
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,720
a bilinear group there is there are like

392
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
three groups g

393
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,279
h and the darker group and a bilinear

394
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,519
map between them and in this case we

395
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
have that the group order is n which is

396
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,399
a large integer which is the product of

397
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
two primes and that

398
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,519
n is large enough so that it is hard to

399
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
find these these prime factors

400
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
um now given that the the com order is

401
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
um composite we have that there are

402
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
non-trivial subgroups and g and h so in

403
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
particular we can identify

404
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,560
in g the group gp1 and gp2 which have

405
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
respective orders p1 and p2 and the and

406
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
in h the group hp1 and hp2

407
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,759
what is

408
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
important to remember is that we have

409
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,320
subgroup orthogonality so that if we

410
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,360
pair something that is in a subgroup

411
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,519
and of order p1 with something that is

412
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
in a subgroup of order between p2 we get

413
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
a trivial element

414
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,399
on the other hand the other

415
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
powerful feature is that we have a

416
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
hidden subgroup assumption so we have

417
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,600
that

418
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
we cannot distinguish

419
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
if an element is in a subgroup or is in

420
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,839
the full group

421
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
so how does this match with a dual

422
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
proof technique

423
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
so the idea is that these spaces these

424
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
dual spaces

425
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,600
will

426
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,759
correspond to subgroups so the

427
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,800
functional

428
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,519
subspace will be a certain sub group of

429
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,079
order p1 and the semifunctional we will

430
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
put it in the group

431
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,279
of subgroup of order p2 and the same for

432
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,800
the secret key but in h because since we

433
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
want to the grip we want to when we want

434
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,920
to decrypt we want to pair a cipher text

435
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,560
with a secret key so we need to put

436
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,959
these on one side of the pairing and the

437
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,799
secret keys on the other side of the

438
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,000
pairing

439
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
now

440
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,760
why does this realize this idea that

441
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
functional with semi-functional decrypts

442
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,959
well etc well because of orthogonality

443
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
so anytime i pair something that is

444
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
functional with something that is

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
semi-functional it will cancel out

446
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
because of subgroup orthogonality

447
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
on the other hand if i pair something

448
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
that is semi-functional with something

449
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,559
semi-functional i will get this will not

450
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
cancel out and i will get

451
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,240
um a

452
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
blinding factor that will obscure my

453
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
decryption so now we move on to the

454
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,600
the key

455
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,480
um point in the technique so how can we

456
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
plot this independent randomness in the

457
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,840
semi-functional key space

458
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,520
so for this

459
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
we use the deja queue technique of chase

460
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,360
and michael jam

461
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,799
so

462
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,760
the idea is that

463
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,480
we

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
repeated repeat many times two steps

465
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,039
and one step um in one step

466
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,280
we use the subgroup hiding assumption

467
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
and what we do is we start with a

468
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
functional key and using the subgroup

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
hiding we can plug in some copy of this

470
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,320
key in the group of order b2

471
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,039
and this is called in later world the

472
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
entropy injection

473
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
phase

474
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280
later

475
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
by the chinese remainder theorem we can

476
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,760
argue that in fact um information

477
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,360
theoretically it's equivalent to the um

478
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
we can change these these keys in the

479
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,120
semi-functional key

480
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
space for another value of the master

481
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
secret key why because

482
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
um the chinese remainder theorem tells

483
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
us that whatever you do modulo p1 is

484
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
completely independent of what happens

485
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
modulo p2 so you actually

486
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,240
um

487
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,200
here alpha is only league modulo p1 here

488
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
it's leaked modulo p2 so of course you

489
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,880
don't know if it's the same alpha or not

490
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
so if you we do repeat many times these

491
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
two steps

492
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
we can keep changing and getting a

493
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,840
different

494
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
alpha in each in the semi-functional

495
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,840
component at each step so we move to we

496
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,080
end up with a sum

497
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
of different with different alphas in

498
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
the semi-functional space

499
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,400
so

500
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
now we it's very easy to argue that the

501
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
randomness is independent since

502
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,039
um

503
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,559
this is a q-wise independent function so

504
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
from the point of view of the adversary

505
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
this is the same as a truly random

506
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
function can we do that in the prime

507
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,080
order setting

508
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,880
so

509
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,559
we will see

510
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,600
we will

511
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
um

512
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
see how

513
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,200
um we tries to do this in the

514
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
um

515
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,559
prime order setting for proving the

516
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
security of his candidate prime order

517
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,200
ibe

518
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,240
the first thing you have to know is that

519
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,559
how can we emulate these hidden

520
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
subgroups in primordial groups so this

521
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
is a very well known technique and the

522
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,400
idea is that

523
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
um

524
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,799
the standard assumptions including ddh

525
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,320
or decisional linear

526
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,080
[Music]

527
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
so standard assumptions like ddh or

528
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,880
decisional linear can be used to emulate

529
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
subgroup as some hidden subgroup

530
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,440
assumptions in particular we can

531
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
generalize these assumptions to uh

532
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
matrix different helm and assumption as

533
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
proposed to

534
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,760
um

535
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
by

536
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,799
escalating

537
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,440
crypto 13 and the idea is that um

538
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
all these assumptions can be written in

539
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,960
the following form we have a matrix

540
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
given in the group

541
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,039
and we cannot distinguish if some

542
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,840
certain vector is

543
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,799
um

544
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,559
in the image of this matrix in the

545
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,559
exponent or not okay so our group um g1

546
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,559
is now

547
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,159
um

548
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,880
the image of some matrix so we have the

549
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,840
functional space

550
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
corresponds to the image of some matrix

551
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,480
a

552
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,799
the functional space for the secret keys

553
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
corresponding to the image of some

554
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
matrix b

555
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,919
and now remember we want to have this

556
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,480
orthogonality feature so of course it

557
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
makes sense to put the semi-functional

558
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
space for the ciphertext in some

559
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
some back in the space generated by some

560
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
vector b which is orthogonal to the

561
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
functional space of the secret keys and

562
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,679
the same for

563
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,520
the semi-functional space for the keys

564
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,919
it should be in the space generated by

565
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
some vector i which is orthogonal to the

566
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,120
functional space for the ciphertext

567
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
so this gives the

568
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
this motivates the prime order

569
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
translation of quiz so we have this

570
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
function of space is translated in this

571
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
way

572
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
the semi-functional space is uh

573
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
corresponds to

574
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,559
things that are in a certain

575
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,240
um

576
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,559
space generated by one vector

577
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,679
and now for making dimensions my match

578
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
what used to be the master secret key

579
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,799
now becomes a matrix remember that this

580
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,600
k

581
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,559
um

582
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,919
is this case is supposed to

583
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
corresp is a is a parameter that tells

584
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
you how hard is your assumption so if

585
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
you are happy with using the difficult

586
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
assumption

587
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,039
and this k is equal one so

588
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,760
this would be your secret key in the

589
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
simplest case is a two times two matrix

590
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
and now the secret key is usually you

591
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,600
put in verbs so now you have to invert a

592
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,440
certain matrix

593
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
so

594
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
let's do some wishful thinking and think

595
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
how we would use this deja q technique

596
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
um

597
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,760
for

598
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
in the prime order setting so the first

599
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
thing is

600
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
to observe sorry to observe that we

601
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
definitely can

602
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
do the first step and be a subspace

603
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
hiding

604
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
um make a copy of this uh

605
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
of this

606
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,960
of this uh key in the semi-functional

607
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,400
space okay because we can you can get a

608
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
challenge and you don't know if it's in

609
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
bu or you know or it has a component in

610
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
this space and be a subspace hiding is

611
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,960
very easy to make a copy of the key in

612
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
the semi-functional space

613
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,679
and now we would like to argue similar

614
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,720
as in the composite order case and say

615
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,080
um b that thanks to parameter hiding we

616
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,880
can change this w by some w um

617
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
over line

618
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
if we could do that we could repeat this

619
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
many times and then we again we would

620
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,000
get some sum here of q terms and this is

621
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,279
a q wise

622
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,799
independent

623
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,200
function and this would give me a random

624
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
function in the semi-functional space

625
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,760
so the

626
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
final question is

627
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
um

628
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
do we have this parameter

629
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
hiding in

630
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
prime order so in composite order our

631
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
argument was that if i have to one div

632
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
with this exponent this leaks nothing

633
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
about the projection of

634
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,840
um one divided by alpha plus id on this

635
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,039
other space

636
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,200
and our question now is

637
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,679
does this so the projection

638
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,400
on the functional space of this matrix

639
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
give me information about the

640
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,720
projection on the non uh on the

641
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,039
semi-functional space

642
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,240
for this we use our main result comes

643
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,559
from a linear algebra lemma that we

644
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,520
prove

645
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,200
and we show that um the following so if

646
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,679
you have w is your secret key

647
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,720
is your master secret key and assume it

648
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,000
can be diagonalized and we have a basis

649
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
of eigenvectors which is f1 f and k plus

650
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
one and alpha 1 alpha k plus 1 are the

651
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
eigenvalues

652
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,279
what we show is that if r

653
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,080
are the coordinates of b u in this basis

654
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,039
so this is a basis so these are are just

655
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,200
the coordinates that express

656
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
b u in these terms

657
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,440
we have this very simple expression we

658
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
have that

659
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
this thing which is the secret key

660
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,799
is a sum of from i 1 to k plus 1 of

661
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,600
the coordinates divided by the

662
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
eigenvectors plus id

663
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,840
times the eigenvalues

664
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
so we have this simple form

665
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
so we have the expression of the secret

666
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,919
keys in terms of eigenback to eigenva

667
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
vectors and eigenvalues of the secret

668
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,600
key

669
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
so

670
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
we show

671
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
using this formula it's easy to see that

672
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
there is no parameter

673
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
hiding in the general case so what do we

674
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
mean in the general case so assume that

675
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,600
ri

676
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
is not zero for all

677
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,559
i

678
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
from one to k plus one we call this

679
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,559
general case because

680
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,200
um if you sample b and w independently

681
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
r will be nonzero most of the cases

682
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,480
right

683
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,799
so in this case there is easy to see

684
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,440
that there is an unbounded algorithm

685
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,559
that

686
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,360
recovers the eigenvalues

687
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,039
it doesn't really matter to understand

688
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,480
the details but um the idea is that

689
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
you can make a guess

690
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
and then obviously if you guess the

691
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
right uh

692
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
eigenvalues you will be able to cancel

693
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
this denominator and then you what you

694
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,720
will get is that the

695
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
the secret keys

696
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,640
multiplied by this this will form a

697
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
polynomial of degree k

698
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
you have many keys so of course you can

699
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
test this you can test that if you

700
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,799
multiply them by this value if they end

701
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
up um by interpolation if they are they

702
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,840
form a polynomial of degree k

703
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
and note that this is an unbounded

704
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,520
algorithm because we are arguing about

705
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,440
an information theoretic property so we

706
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
don't care that the algorithm is

707
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
unbounded

708
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
bottom line it doesn't matter um if you

709
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
understood this but the bottom line is

710
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,679
that

711
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,120
um if our i is not zero we can recover

712
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
all the eigenvalues

713
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,200
and in by uh

714
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
simple

715
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,520
um arguments about linear systems we can

716
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
also recover the eigenvectors

717
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,840
okay so and obviously we have the

718
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,399
eigenvalues and the eigenvectors we can

719
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
recover all of the w so which means

720
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,799
that

721
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,600
if all the ri are nonzero

722
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
we have no parameter 0 no parameter

723
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,919
hiding

724
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,039
so

725
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,399
do we have hope so what happens if some

726
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,679
ri is 0 then obviously

727
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
this does not leak all information about

728
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,640
um w since some alpha i is hidden

729
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
um

730
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
so in particular we could think what

731
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
happens if we choose that b is a k

732
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
dimensional space remember b is a column

733
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
it's a k dimensional space and these are

734
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,760
k

735
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,039
vectors of dimension k plus one

736
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,080
um formed by the eigen eigen

737
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,159
vectors

738
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,840
then of course there would be some

739
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,159
information about uh w that would be

740
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,200
hidden namely the eight k plus one um

741
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
eigenvalue

742
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,600
unfortunately this would solve the

743
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
problem that we have parameter hiding

744
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,799
but

745
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,600
this is not compatible with plugging in

746
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,520
a decisional assumption

747
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,279
um in b

748
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,919
so the issue is that we need w to

749
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,159
compute the secret keys on the other

750
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,000
hand if we want to use um b uh as a

751
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,480
decisional assumption we cannot have um

752
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,679
the um the eigenvalues the eigenvectors

753
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,760
in the exponent

754
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,559
in conclusion if b is a matrix

755
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,480
generating the subgroup

756
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,000
and and w are chosen independently

757
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
um we don't have parameter hiding if

758
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
they are chosen to depend on each other

759
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
then we run into a difficult problem

760
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
because we don't know how to simulate

761
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
secret keys

762
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,559
um so in we don't think that this has a

763
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
solution and there we think there is no

764
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,399
translation of the deja cube um

765
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,200
technique in the prime order setting

766
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
obviously this does not prove that the

767
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
scheme of we is not secure

768
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
but the most interesting part was to

769
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
prove it secure under standard

770
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,440
assumptions

771
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,399
in summary the tale is told

772
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,399
the grief is shared

773
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,640
and although you might still not be

774
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,840
wiser

775
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
our hearts

776
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,240
certainly feel lighter so thank you very

777
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,679
much for listening to this talk

778
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,880
nice

779
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
also very nicely celebrated thank you

780
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,678
for the talk

781
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
i have to say it's quite faithful to

782
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
watch yourself record it

783
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
yeah i guess it's normal i don't see any

784
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,320
questions in the seatbelt chat now i

785
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,559
don't see any questions here on zoom

786
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
we're a small enough audience that

787
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
people can unmute if they want to ask

788
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,960
questions

789
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,559
but let me start by well why is this a

790
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,039
failure because you want to show it

791
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,760
secure or because

792
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,200
um yeah well well it's

793
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,440
well it certainly i have to start with

794
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,760
the subjective part and it certainly

795
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,960
felt like a failure so and this is true

796
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,399
what i said that this was a long time

797
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,600
ago because

798
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
um we had this javier and flight and

799
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
we're starting the phd we invested a lot

800
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,559
of energy and trying to to get this

801
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,600
result and it didn't it didn't work

802
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,159
um so it is a success in the sense that

803
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,279
it it solves the open question left

804
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,080
so

805
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,279
we had

806
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,480
he

807
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
he said okay i proposed this uh prime

808
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,159
order translation

809
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,960
and he also said i i know parameter

810
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
hiding doesn't

811
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,600
doesn't work if the matrix w is diagonal

812
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
but i don't know what happens otherwise

813
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,960
also it's it's all the so this solves

814
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
the

815
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
the problem

816
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
but um

817
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
yeah but

818
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,399
for sure it felt like a i mean it would

819
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,200
be actually a very nice thing because uh

820
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,760
there's plenty of schemes and use these

821
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
q assumptions and

822
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,640
like the only so to use this like sort

823
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,399
of bonnet boyen type of um

824
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,880
signature in the secret key and all of

825
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,360
them need q assumptions to be proven

826
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,279
also it would be like really nice if you

827
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,760
have something like that and

828
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,080
this looks like um

829
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,799
that's a difficult thing to do

830
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,320
yeah but then understanding that it

831
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,799
can't work this way is also a success

832
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,960
at least it's very insightful

833
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,679
yes um for sure but like maybe for the

834
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
phd students who are starting the thesis

835
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
if you don't cannot publish it it's uh

836
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,640
it uh it feels like a failure yeah um

837
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,799
also i think failure is relative to the

838
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,360
amount of time that you spend right if

839
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,399
like uh if you spend like your afternoon

840
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,799
and you're like oh it does work then

841
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,880
you're happy to

842
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,440
it doesn't matter no but like um

843
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,519
and in retrospective it's also like

844
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,080
super it's actually very simple in fact

845
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
quite like the correct this algebraic

846
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,640
characterization is like a is a very

847
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,080
simple

848
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,760
linear algebra

849
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,720
trick

850
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,519
so

851
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,600
it's it shouldn't have been that hard

852
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,679
but we spent like really a lot of time

853
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,240
thinking about this like oh

854
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
and could we said now it's like it's

855
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,679
very obvious that

856
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,559
like well i guess this is true for

857
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,320
everything right like failures and

858
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
success

859
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
retrospective you're like

860
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
what was so hard about that so

861
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,919
i have a question

862
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,360
yeah um uh so so this was this was for a

863
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,519
very like particular form of a linear

864
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,960
transformation right that you're sort of

865
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,600
assuming that like same format of the ri

866
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,799
over the alpha plus uh id do you think

867
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,399
that there might be a generalization of

868
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,240
this to general sort of linear

869
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
transformations or do you think that

870
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
there might be a possibility to sort of

871
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,840
tweak that format

872
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,600
[Music]

873
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,039
no i i i think it you can generalize it

874
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,880
so um

875
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
so here what you use really for this

876
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,399
lemma is you use the fact that uh

877
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
so that

878
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,760
you have w plus id times the identity

879
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,199
matrix and what you use is that the

880
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
identity everything is an eigenvector of

881
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,760
the identity matrix

882
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
and that's it

883
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,120
um

884
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,480
[Music]

885
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,599
so

886
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,159
i think more generally like intuitively

887
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,560
anything that is in general form

888
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
tends to leak because you have so many

889
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,280
keys

890
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,639
and then

891
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,280
no and then again you pro i think more

892
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
generally you could have

893
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,679
that any that if you need a dependence

894
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,599
between the

895
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
the the decisional assumption and the

896
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,918
key this looks like um

897
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,560
a difficult problem so of course the the

898
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
concrete form of leakage and the

899
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,920
the function really uses that

900
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,079
the form but like the principle idea i

901
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,119
think

902
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,040
it will be similar

903
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,720
that would be my gut too it just seems

904
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,560
like kind of a pain to like formulate it

905
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
in the abstract but yeah it seems it

906
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,079
seems like it would it would generalize

907
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,480
well in iv like i focus on the on the

908
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,880
secret part and the secret key right but

909
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
like um

910
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,160
well on top of this you also have it to

911
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,480
have w in the other side of the bearing

912
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
somehow

913
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
so it makes it like you really need it

914
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
in the exponent

915
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,598
so it's it seems like i don't know

916
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,960
difficult

917
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,760
like once since really like i had to

918
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
refresh it in my mind because i had

919
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,680
forgotten everything about it so this

920
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,839
time i was again thinking like oh but

921
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,760
maybe you know but then it was like

922
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
again like that convinced that it gets

923
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,850
you every time yep

924
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,480
[Music]

925
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,400
all right i assume that both talks are

926
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
supposed to be the same length so i

927
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
think we should move on

928
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,599
but thank you very much for your talk

929
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,359
another virtual awesome audible applause
