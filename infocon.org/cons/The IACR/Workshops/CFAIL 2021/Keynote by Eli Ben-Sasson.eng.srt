1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
all right so welcome to session two

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,480
which is our invited keynote uh this

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
year's talk is going to be by uh ellie

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
vince assan we're very excited to to

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
have him with us um the title of the

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,240
talk is from stark to starkwear the

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
winding path from theory to practice

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,400
thank you um i just want to make sure am

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
i supposed to start now or at the on the

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,840
30

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,360
i think uh

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
i think we're we're starting now and

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,040
then we can leave some time for for

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
questions at the end so we've got from

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
now until the end of the hour

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
okay terrific

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,760
so uh thank you very much for uh for

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
having me here and um i i'm not going to

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
use the slides for for my talks it's

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,719
going to basically

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
be a little bit about

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
telling my story and interactively doing

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
so uh so happy to

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,399
answer um

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
questions about it so this is gonna be a

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
story that i hope to touch on on four

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
themes that may be relevant to

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,080
some of you uh either now or down down

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
the road

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
and feel free to

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,119
you know ask questions and interrupt so

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
this is a question about

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,439
the long and arduous road from theory to

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
practice that is a little bit like

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
walking in the desert that i want to

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
share with you um it's also going to be

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,119
a story about the second theme is

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,840
the story of uh there's a

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
about the stone which the builders

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,799
rejected

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
becoming the chief cornerstone which is

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,920
a

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,119
um

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
a verse from psalms that sort of

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,159
reflects a lot of what's happened at

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
least in my trajectory but also to the

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,360
whole field

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,759
um i want to talk a little bit about

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,240
managing you know academic versus

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
entrepreneurship

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
challenges there

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
and a little bit about the difference

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,759
between research and practice

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,439
you know similarities and differences so

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,600
i'll just start

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
so a little bit just about myself

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,480
because i'm not a standard cryptographer

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
uh in my upbringing i

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
was a theoretical computer scientist and

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
i did a lot of uh complexity theory um

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,480
and then i started researching

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,680
probabilistically checkable proofs

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
um and from there i slowly uh

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
the stuff i was doing

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,319
slowly turned into

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,560
having some applications to

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
uh blockchains

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
and uh i'll tell you a little bit about

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,440
that

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
and

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
three years three and a half years ago

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
oh okay sorry something like five or six

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
years ago um based on academic work that

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
my colleagues and i did i was a

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
co-founder of zcash which is a

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
cryptocurrency they then was already

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,480
already along down the rabbit hole of

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,319
cryptocurrencies in this fascinating

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
world that i'll tell you about

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
and uh three and a half years ago i

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
essentially left the academic life to

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,319
become an entrepreneur i co-founded

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,760
another company that's around uh

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
commercializing uh this latest uh piece

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
of research that's called starks so i'm

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
gonna go back to the early days and and

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
say a little bit that uh a little bit

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
about this theme of the uh you know the

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
stone which the builders rejected

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,560
becoming uh the chief cornerstone so uh

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,599
in the

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,799
90s and even late 80s of the previous

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
century

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
the study of interactive proofs and then

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
also the probabilistically checkable

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
proof

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
theorem emerged as a very important

98
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,799
topic

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
you probably a lot of you have heard

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,159
about the pcp theorem and

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
within uh theoretical computer science

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
the pcp theorem has two possible

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
applications and one

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
was always from the start immensely

105
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
researched and became sort of the

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
main thing about pcps whereas the other

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
one was this uh stone which the builders

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
rejected um you know collectively but

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
but has become a cornerstone of a lot of

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,640
things that happened since then so one

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,358
potential application of the pcp theorem

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,000
is to prove

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,279
inapproximability results it is to show

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,000
that assuming that p does not equal np

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
then you cannot

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
find an assignment there's no algorithm

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
that will find an assignment that

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
satisfies more than seven eighths of the

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,280
constraints of a three cnf and many

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
other celebrated results you cannot um

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
approximate

122
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
a vertex cover better than some constant

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
that's been improved over the time so

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
this was the branch that this study of

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
the pcp theorem went through and then

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
like

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
thousands of works have uh

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
explored it and and once you put your

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
focus on that thing it's sort of there

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
are certain parameters that are very

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
important the number of

132
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,000
queries that you make uh to uh pcp

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
assignment and the soundness that you

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
get from it those are really important

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
but things like the efficiency the time

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,680
it takes to generate the proof

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
uh

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
becomes a second order and it's not that

139
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,919
interesting

140
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,320
and the time needed to verify it

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
not the number of queries but the

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,000
overall work that a verifier would need

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
in order to verify a pcp statement or

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
pcp proof it takes a second order

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
okay there was this early on and and the

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
very first paper that that that led the

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
way uh you know showing the connection

148
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
between probabilistically checkable

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,440
proofs and in approximability is a

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,080
famous paper fglss

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
uh

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,470
goldwasser

153
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,840
[Music]

154
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,400
loves

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
and i think sudan and segedy

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
i may be forgetting the last two ones

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
but uh so this was a very important line

158
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,919
of works now there's the less traveled

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
path that was taken and essentially

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
started in two

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
amazing papers by babaya tal

162
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,240
was bfl and bfls and they explored

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
what you can do in terms of scaling the

164
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
verification of computation sort of

165
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,720
compressing the task of checking that

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
computation was done correctly basically

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
uh getting

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,960
integrity on the cheek

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,759
and

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
um so two papers one showed it first for

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,639
all languages next

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
this was by bfl by

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
fort now and lund in 91 and a second

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,919
paper that sort of down scaled it to to

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,960
np

176
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,440
with poly logarithmic verification of

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
general computation by by fault now

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,000
uh levine and segedy so these two papers

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
that that are highly regarded but the

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
the sort of the path that naturally

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
follows from them

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,199
was very few looked at it so because

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
the main question in hardness of

184
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
approximation is to get more problems

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
for which you can get tighter results

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
that you cannot approximate them well so

187
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,479
you get these this line of negative

188
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,039
results these results of impossibility

189
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
okay but the line of works that looks

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
into positive results about speeding up

191
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
the verification of computation uh there

192
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
were very few works that looked into

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
that okay um it was not uh it was not

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
something of interest and if you look at

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,199
that and the things you're interested in

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
is making the size of the pcp proof

197
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
shorter the time needed to generate is

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
is shorter and uh you really care about

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
the time required by the verifier to

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,599
verify a computation so all of these

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,479
questions were were not uh deeply

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
explored and

203
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,240
so i'm going back to my own personal

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
story in 2001 when i started my postdoc

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
uh one of the questions that basically i

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
started looking uh with uh i was hosted

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,039
at the time by

208
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
um salil badan in maduro sudan at

209
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,240
harvard uh so salil vadan was then at

210
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
harvard and still is and madu sudan was

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,199
then at mit and now he's at harvard a

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
question they

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
basically asked me was about the um

214
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
you know

215
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
the length of the proof of pcp because

216
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
there were a few works that looked at it

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
but but not a lot and

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
i just came from different fields so

219
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,199
started looking into it and we got some

220
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,560
some some very nice results uh early on

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
but um

222
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
these results were all in the vein of

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
getting the proofs to be shorter

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,919
and um the way they were so so they got

225
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
respect within the community of

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
theoretical computer science but they

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
definitely always took second seed to

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
anything that came out of the hardness

229
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,080
of approximation line of results because

230
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
everyone was looking at that and you

231
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,399
know knew um so so there was the unique

232
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
games conjecture and improvements on

233
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
that and it's it's beautiful and

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
fascinating work but sort of the uh the

235
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
question of getting the proofs to be

236
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
shorter and more efficient uh was

237
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
something that people said okay it's

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
really

239
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
cool that you guys are looking at it but

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
you know it's not really of interest uh

241
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
uh so i'm putting words in the mouth of

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
the community but this was sort of the

243
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,480
reaction you know this is not something

244
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,279
that

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
people really care about um but you know

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
i and my colleagues uh we found that uh

247
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
very interesting line of research and

248
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
continued and proceeded there so it was

249
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,519
a bunch of

250
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
it started i guess my uh path into sort

251
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,279
of the theory to practice started in

252
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,080
uh looking at theoretical questions that

253
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
i thought were very natural and that do

254
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
interesting uh

255
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
math but but were generally uh

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
not found or not viewed to be of the

257
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
most uh you know

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
the most interesting thing within the

259
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
field that i was working on

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
in the larger field um the the second

261
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,000
thing that happened was that

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
um a bit later on since uh the

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
constructions we got were pretty

264
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
efficient even you know if you look at

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,839
them

266
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
semi-practically

267
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
um

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
the second thing that happened was that

269
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
some

270
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
graduate students and undergraduate

271
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
students wanted

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
just out of uh interest to do you know a

273
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
project uh that involves you know theory

274
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,959
to practice so they wanted to implement

275
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
some of these things so

276
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
early on we had a construction madu

277
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
sudan and i um about quasi-linear pcps

278
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,160
where the where the proof length is

279
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
nearly linear in the size of the uh of

280
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
the computation

281
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
and it is a very fft like construction

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
so it's pretty practically efficient

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
so the first thing that happened was

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,079
that already in 2005

285
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
um

286
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
was then a student now as a faculty

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
member

288
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,959
an excellent one in complexity theory

289
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
but he needed to do a summer project at

290
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,120
mit and he programmed one part of it uh

291
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
just implemented it and then i was

292
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
teaching courses at technion and taught

293
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
a course on pcps and students of mine

294
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,720
came and said uh

295
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,399
you know we want a summer project uh

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
like programming so three students you

297
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
know programmed over the summer

298
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,360
uh a full pcp system that is based on

299
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
this so it has a more efficient prover

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
and verifier

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
and i still remember they did it for

302
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
a sat instance with

303
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,760
64 variables and roughly the same number

304
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
of

305
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
clauses so a very simple

306
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
statement that so it was completely

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
impractical but they were like

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,680
interested in programming it

309
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
and um

310
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
i guess

311
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,440
then sometime later i received this

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,160
pretty hefty grant from the european

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,839
research council that i so was like 1.7

314
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,000
million euro that i didn't quite know

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,959
what to do with but i thought that maybe

316
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,440
programming this kind of stuff now that

317
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,160
i have this funds and i can't

318
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
there's no way i can pay theoreticians

319
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
and mathematicians to really use it so i

320
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,839
thought that it might be a pretty good

321
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
good use of the funds and i remember

322
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
saying to myself that

323
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
i have no practical application for this

324
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
stuff um i really don't know why but but

325
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
it's a good use for the funds and i can

326
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,959
now spend them and even if nothing comes

327
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,560
out of it uh you know the worst thing

328
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,079
that happened was that i funded you know

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,639
paid salaries for for some students and

330
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
programmers and and things like that and

331
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
i can maybe you know write a publication

332
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
saying look this is what you can do with

333
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
things like the pcp theorem

334
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,160
um so

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
thereby started my very long

336
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
uh an arduous uh path through the desert

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,639
of the theory to practice it took

338
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,120
something like five or seven years i it

339
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
wasn't uh it wasn't a lonely journey

340
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
i had many colleagues that are still my

341
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,639
friends and are still walking uh you

342
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,839
know walk this desert uh

343
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,760
first and foremost among them i want to

344
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
mention alessandro

345
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,959
started as a masters student uh

346
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,639
you know now he's a he's a

347
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
very you know one of the leaders of this

348
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
field but uh

349
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,200
he he got into this mados vilsa was also

350
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
uh started as a master's student

351
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,360
iran

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,920
and daniel

353
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
and then there were many others that

354
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
joined along so it wasn't a lonely

355
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,480
journey but it was a very long and

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,639
it was this sort of thing where

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,760
we would write works that from the

358
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
practical point of view

359
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
made no practical sense because they

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
were too inefficient and from the

361
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
theoreticians point of view first of all

362
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
this was anyways in some area of

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,360
research that anyone anyway no one is

364
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
actually looking at uh you know things

365
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
like the efficiency of

366
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
provers and verifiers and measuring the

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
concrete efficiency and the constants

368
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,639
that you would get if you do this so

369
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
this is something that i mean the

370
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
general field was not really something

371
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,760
that people looked at and

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
writing more and more works about this

373
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,199
was something that

374
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
um

375
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,600
was sort of uh

376
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
yeah it was again so it wasn't one

377
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
person alone doing it but it was a small

378
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
group of people doing this alone with

379
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
with uh with not a lot of uh

380
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,880
uh reception um which was um

381
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
fine in hindsight but uh i guess

382
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
if there's any takeaway message here i

383
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,360
don't know for those who

384
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,079
are trying to do this uh kind of path so

385
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
you know bear in mind that it's a very

386
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
long process and that

387
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
um most of the time you'll have this

388
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,399
feeling that you see certain things and

389
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
you know that these things are that

390
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
these questions are really interesting

391
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
and

392
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
i mean both the questions and some of

393
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
the answers you get to but

394
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
be prepared uh

395
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
that when you try to present this to

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
your colleagues um

397
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,839
they'll sort of uh

398
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,320
you know not quite understand why you're

399
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,079
doing it and then

400
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
and uh so so this was a process that

401
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
went on for a pretty

402
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,800
large number of years um it was a lot of

403
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
fun we didn't it's not like we were uh

404
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
uh

405
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,839
you know we had any second thoughts

406
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,160
about doing it it was very clear to us

407
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,320
that this is a meaningful use of our

408
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
time and resources

409
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
but i mean you know when you get yet

410
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
another rejection of your paper that

411
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
that uh

412
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,199
um

413
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,279
on reasons that you clearly see that

414
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,399
that uh

415
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
you know

416
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
they're not getting it or why this is

417
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
interesting or important where it really

418
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
is uh you know that's something that

419
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
you're going to be experiencing

420
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
um

421
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
so the next turn of events

422
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,800
happens so we were chugging along

423
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
basically trying to implement

424
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,639
[Music]

425
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
the pcp theorem for practical reasons

426
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
those practical reasons were to get

427
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
better scalability so that the verifying

428
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
of the computation

429
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
of general universal computation you

430
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
know given by a generic

431
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,560
program could be done in much less

432
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
computation

433
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
than

434
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,279
than

435
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,440
than it would take to naively re-execute

436
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
the computation okay

437
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
so

438
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
this brings us to about uh the next

439
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
so so this hap started i started the

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
project uh around 2009

441
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
um

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
and

443
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,320
by

444
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
2013

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,799
i was uh there were some initial

446
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,439
preliminary

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,000
constructions

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
so i went around giving some talks about

449
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,679
them

450
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,240
and then came this realization pretty

451
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,280
quickly

452
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,359
that it's not clear

453
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,400
that they have any use in the world and

454
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,079
here there's sort of a miracle that

455
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,319
happened um

456
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,440
which is blockchains

457
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
so

458
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
we have this these set of constructions

459
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,960
that give you essentially proofs some of

460
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
them with zero knowledge some of them

461
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,640
just uh

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
that are much shorter than running the

463
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
computation and now

464
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
you have them not just as a theory paper

465
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
but you have them in practice

466
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
so the question emerges um okay what's

467
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
the use case i mean someone's writing

468
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
code for these things so um

469
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,280
why why other than writing a paper and

470
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
it's a not if if you try to factor out

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
blockchains i mean imagine a world where

472
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
blockchains are not around

473
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
um it's very hard to uh to answer this

474
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
question until this day if you ask

475
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,160
where in the

476
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
real in the conventional world outside

477
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,799
of blockchains do you see

478
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,679
real use massive use of uh zero

479
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,080
knowledge proofs of proofs of uh you

480
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
know succinct proofs of integrity snarks

481
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,799
starts things like that the answer is

482
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,840
pretty much

483
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
nowhere

484
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,559
and

485
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,600
so i was

486
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,160
giving these presentations that were

487
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
geared at

488
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
academics and other places and i tried

489
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
to find some examples and i also had

490
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
discussions with

491
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
many people and sort of that had

492
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
experience in the theory to practice i

493
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
remember talking to

494
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,280
ron rivest and many others at mit where

495
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,000
i was at the time was doing a sabbatical

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
and

497
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,679
they thought it's cool but uh

498
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,799
uh

499
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,440
i remember nikolai zedovic saying uh

500
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
yeah sure if i could press a button on

501
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,919
gmail that says everything that google

502
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,120
is doing

503
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,760
with your uh information is has been

504
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,080
proved sure i would press that button

505
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,039
but

506
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,400
like why why is it needed and

507
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,039
it's a very good question you know why

508
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,280
and why in the conventional world would

509
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,720
someone need to prove something to

510
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,679
someone else

511
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,919
and the answer is

512
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
it's very hard to come up with good

513
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
stories uh i worked very hard to try and

514
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
come up with stories but they didn't

515
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,880
quite catch on and the reason i'll get

516
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
to it in a minute um

517
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
what happened was this was in 2013 so

518
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,679
remember this was already i was down

519
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
this path of theory to practice for

520
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
somewhere between

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
five

522
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
years and five and seven years spending

523
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,880
a lot of resources my time uh time of

524
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
others

525
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
and there's no real

526
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,600
use case in mind for this thing um

527
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
and then there was this uh so for me it

528
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400
was this watershed eureka moment of

529
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
uh i went to

530
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,600
um so i heard that there's a conference

531
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,919
a bitcoin conference in san jose like

532
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,720
the yearly bitcoin conference this was

533
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,440
in 2013 so bitcoin was turning

534
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
like roughly four bitcoin launched in

535
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
you know early in

536
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,159
late in 2008 or just in the beginning

537
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
2009 so bitcoin was roughly four years

538
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,360
old

539
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
and uh

540
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
it was very young and uh

541
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
so so i didn't hear much about it till

542
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
then but but i

543
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,039
reached out and said look i have this uh

544
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,159
this work

545
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,840
that my colleagues and i are doing about

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
uh proofs uh of computational integrity

547
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,480
that you can basically check things more

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,559
efficiently and do it sometimes with

549
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
zero knowledge and they said yeah sure

550
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
that sounds interesting to us why don't

551
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,320
you come and give a talk

552
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
so in may 2013 um as i was doing my tour

553
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,320
of uh giving talks in places like

554
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
princeton and stanford

555
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,320
and having

556
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
a lot of my colleagues colleagues you

557
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,159
know sit there and say wow this is

558
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
really cool but like you know why

559
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,320
um or what would you do with it or

560
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
i went to san jose

561
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
and this was by far the most

562
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,320
electrifying

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
conference i have been to

564
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
till that time probably since then uh

565
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
the first reason was there was this sort

566
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
of a woodstock kind of

567
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,159
aura to it there was this feeling of the

568
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,720
attendance that they are

569
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,320
now evidencing uh and and

570
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
advancing

571
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,919
a revolution in history and they had

572
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,400
they were very conscious of it

573
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
they are now changing the world for the

574
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
better so it was very electrifying to be

575
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,159
in such a conference it's still one of

576
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,039
the most

577
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,520
um

578
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,159
impressive events i attended um so that

579
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,080
was one aspect of it and remember this

580
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
was after having

581
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,760
been many times in in you know the

582
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,039
standard

583
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
stock fox tcc kind of conferences that

584
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,039
are very

585
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
a bunch of very smart people but

586
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,520
there isn't this grand feeling of we are

587
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
actually changing the world now so that

588
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,760
was one aspect of it but the more

589
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
important on a personal level aspect of

590
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,559
it was that that i gave this talk was

591
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,159
called universal and affordable

592
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,360
computational integrity and rather than

593
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
people coming like sort of glass-eyed

594
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
and saying wait a second who's going to

595
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
prove

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
what to whom and why and

597
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
that many people showed up and they were

598
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,640
like core developers of of of bitcoin at

599
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,039
the time greg maxwell and mike hearn a

600
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
lot of these like you know the founding

601
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
fathers of that field and essentially

602
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,600
what they said is um their questions

603
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,520
were different they were okay where is

604
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,799
the code

605
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,919
can we start using it tomorrow and

606
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,320
you know no need to tell us applications

607
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
here like four different things

608
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
that that are really really burning to

609
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,440
us and we would use this for them

610
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,840
tomorrow

611
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
and i wasn't aware of it at the time but

612
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
later on it sort of

613
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400
dawned at me that that uh

614
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,840
the world of blockchains because of its

615
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,880
assumptions um

616
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
and maybe i'll show a few slides on it a

617
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
bit later on on what you know what my

618
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
realization is now it wasn't clear to me

619
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
then it was just the sense that here is

620
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
something so i was remember we were it's

621
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
not just me it was this team of like uh

622
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
five to seven people that we were like

623
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
walking this desert and doing things

624
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
that we loved and cared about but had no

625
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
application and suddenly you reach this

626
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
oasis where you know the things that

627
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,640
you're doing uh people really are

628
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
passionate about them and they see why

629
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,960
they need it

630
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
now at the same time

631
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,919
we were also working on these non-pcp

632
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,720
related or only tangentially related pcp

633
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
constructions

634
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,559
called snarks and quadratic arithmetic

635
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,919
programs uh that that are again by today

636
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,919
they're extremely popular

637
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,320
and um at the same conference also there

638
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,240
was a team from john hopkins that

639
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
presented a work about privacy zerocoin

640
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
and uh sort of shortly after we realized

641
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
that we have this we've been building

642
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
this really cool engine that we didn't

643
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
quite uh

644
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
uh you know

645
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
find its use in the conventional world

646
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,799
uh whereas they had this they were

647
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
academics but were deeper into

648
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,559
blockchains early on and had this uh

649
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,799
application of privacy and blockchains

650
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
that they needed the right engine for so

651
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
we teamed together and this led to zero

652
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,279
cash which was an academic paper that

653
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,080
basically used the zk snarks you know in

654
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
order to provide privacy for uh

655
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,440
blockchains and more fungibility um

656
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,559
which then led to uh us being approached

657
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,159
by a team of engineers

658
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,120
that came from the sort of a

659
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,559
cyber

660
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
security world led by

661
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,960
zuko

662
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
and

663
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
we partnered together both the we were

664
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
seven co-authors of the academic paper

665
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
on zero cash we partnered with with the

666
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,039
team um of of zuko and his uh

667
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,240
colleagues and founded zcash this was

668
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
around 2014 so it was roughly like or

669
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
2015 this was one year after um the sort

670
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,600
of

671
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,679
eureka moment or this watershed moment

672
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
of of realizing that the uh

673
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,000
this thing that we've been walking in

674
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,080
the desert building and we loved but no

675
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,880
one really cared about has this set of

676
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,799
applications in this

677
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
very weird and strange world that we

678
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,760
didn't know about at the time uh it was

679
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,039
blockchains um so this

680
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,120
got to about uh

681
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,320
um so this is you know what led to

682
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,600
z cash uh which uses zk snarks which is

683
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
not quite the sort of pcp kind of stuff

684
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,039
that uh you know we started off with

685
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,640
maybe i'll pause here and ask if there

686
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
are questions

687
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
all right then people can feel free to

688
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,159
put questions in the chat either here on

689
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
zoom or i'm also monitoring on on

690
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,320
or or you can feel free to to jump in uh

691
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
one sort of general question i have like

692
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
as a person who's also done this

693
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,640
transition from from theory to practice

694
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
after having gone through that

695
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,400
do you feel differently about the sort

696
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
of like community conventions and

697
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,720
support structures for people making

698
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
that transition and for building that

699
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
bridge between theory and practice or do

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
you think there's things that we need to

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,640
improve upon to make that more possible

702
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,679
um

703
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
i think there's there and by the way i

704
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
see a question in in the chat that i'll

705
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,679
answer in a minute by carla um

706
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,480
i'm sure there can be a lot to

707
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,559
to be improved for instance

708
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,440
i was already uh tenured when i started

709
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
this path and i remember saying to

710
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,480
myself

711
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
okay that's that's fine like i could i

712
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
could survive uh you know without

713
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,240
publications that are cherished by my

714
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,120
core

715
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,240
community

716
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
uh for a few years or forever you know

717
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,440
the worst case you know my whatever

718
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
my next

719
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
um

720
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,159
appointment would wait a bit

721
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,640
but i think for people early on in their

722
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
career for which this is extremely

723
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,360
important it's very hard to do these

724
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,240
things

725
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,559
um

726
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
i guess the biggest uh yeah if i have to

727
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
sort of pass criticism or what has to

728
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
change it is that at least if the

729
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,440
community that i was in was extremely

730
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
maybe still is extremely

731
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,640
orthodox in in saying you know

732
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
these are some questions that are really

733
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,360
important and

734
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,399
the and uh when you

735
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,320
even before i started down this path i

736
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
remember sort of questioning this sort

737
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
of uh you know must it be this orthodox

738
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,600
is it really that these other works that

739
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,320
are

740
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,760
you know not exactly uh answering the

741
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
five questions that i don't know exactly

742
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
who even crafted but that everyone's not

743
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,600
rushing to solve uh must be that they

744
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
are you know rejected from conferences

745
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
and not cool and so on and

746
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
i don't have a good so so there is a lot

747
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,159
of orthodoxy and a lot of uh saying i

748
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,799
mean right orthodox actually means right

749
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,200
way so there's the right way there's a

750
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
right set of questions that that must be

751
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,840
asked and if you're not working on these

752
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
questions that are

753
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,440
uh decided upon somehow by the wise

754
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,919
elders of the field i'm guessing then uh

755
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
then it's not but i don't quite know how

756
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
to what what a meaningful change would

757
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
be because

758
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,159
i think the history of society is such

759
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,799
that there's always some you know cabal

760
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,399
of uh

761
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
wise elders who now think that this set

762
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,679
of questions

763
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,000
is really important and then some other

764
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,640
cabal comes along and rightly sort of

765
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
either appends them or

766
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
uh there's this saying science advances

767
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
one coffin at a time so you know the old

768
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
guard uh moves away and now there's a

769
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,360
new set of questions but i don't know

770
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
how to actually make it

771
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,159
so like

772
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,240
you know uh it's not like that this set

773
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,679
of questions is the right one i don't

774
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,720
know just open-mindedness in general and

775
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,520
more appreciation for a variety of

776
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
questions would be good i do think

777
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,799
that the way conferences are run uh sort

778
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
of helps this perpetuate this thing

779
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,120
because conferences

780
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,960
instead of uh

781
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
being sort of uh

782
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,360
this thing that says okay you want to

783
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
talk about something uh she wants to

784
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
listen to it okay let's let's just set

785
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,960
this up they sort of turned into this uh

786
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
thing where only the most excellent

787
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,000
works are selected to be presented and

788
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
sort of this min

789
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
this

790
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
mini um ceremony prize of the prize

791
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
being presenting a paper there

792
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,120
and sort of the statement is that oh the

793
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,360
universities need this kind of thing so

794
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
that they can decide who to give tenure

795
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
to and i don't buy that i think it's

796
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,360
part of this just general tendency to uh

797
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
compete

798
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,720
so maybe relaxing that a little bit and

799
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
saying that we're more open to all kinds

800
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,600
of uh research directions would help but

801
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,720
yeah having more uh open-mindedness

802
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,279
would be a good thing

803
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,520
so the question that carla asked in the

804
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,399
chat is do you have a theory of why this

805
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,919
path was lex less explored the path

806
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,480
about you know succinct verification and

807
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,799
efficient proofs i think it has all to

808
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,279
do with uh i'm guessing it was before my

809
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,919
time but my my guess is that it has all

810
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,080
to do with uh personalities and people

811
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,240
and sort of uh you know human politics

812
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,480
that uh certain people said this is

813
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
really cool and they were the cool kids

814
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,519
so the others said yeah this is really

815
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
cool and that other branch is less cool

816
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,120
that's what i think because i know i

817
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,320
have no other

818
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,960
uh no other explanation for i think

819
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
they're beautiful

820
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
math and fundamental questions in this

821
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,480
branch and beautiful math questions in

822
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,120
that branch and i don't i don't know why

823
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
one has been uh

824
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,519
uh so that's my conjecture but uh i

825
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,279
don't know

826
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,720
okay any other question so i'm not on

827
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,399
zulips i don't know if anyone's asking

828
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,399
something here yeah it's been pretty

829
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,600
quiet on tulip today um

830
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
yeah maybe maybe people aren't logged in

831
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,159
um

832
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,679
yeah any any other questions from the

833
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,120
from the audience feel free to jump in

834
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
okay

835
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
just uh okay put it in the chat and

836
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,200
we'll address it later so i wanna so uh

837
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
you know my story has brought us up to

838
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,760
the

839
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
founding of uh

840
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
of z cash which was a

841
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,679
terrific uh experience

842
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
um in sort of uh seeing uh

843
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
seeing

844
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,559
your theoretical research or even you

845
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,159
know the practical research was not

846
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,159
quite practical it was

847
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,399
an academic proof of concept so seeing

848
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,919
this process being

849
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,279
carried out

850
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,880
to uh

851
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,360
um to completion to something that

852
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,279
actually people use

853
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,279
you know random people use on their

854
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,919
desktops or laptops

855
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,399
and now all the steps that were needed

856
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,039
um during that transition you know

857
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,960
fundraising forming a company

858
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,159
hiring um i was viewing that from the

859
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,960
side it was a very exhilarating uh and

860
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,640
fun process i

861
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
you know i recommend all those who can

862
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,120
to sort of be in such a position you

863
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,320
know it's a lot of fun um you learn a

864
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,360
lot you you sort of broaden your

865
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
horizons or the set of skills that

866
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,799
you're uh

867
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,120
all kinds of business negotiations and

868
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,840
then seeing how the uh

869
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,919
vcs and the

870
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,919
right venture capital and fundraising

871
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,320
and this it's it's interesting just uh

872
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,039
again if you're uh very much an academic

873
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,919
who lies to who likes to uh reside only

874
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,240
in the ivory tower as many of my

875
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
colleagues are that's fine but uh it is

876
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,480
something that's a lot of

877
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
fun you you find out that there's a lot

878
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,760
of uh

879
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,360
very bright

880
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,679
interesting smart people out there as

881
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,000
well not just inside the ivory tower

882
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
so that was fun watching it from the

883
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,000
side and another advantage for of

884
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,640
watching it from the sidelines was that

885
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,880
i didn't quite have to manage this

886
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,760
question of academic versus uh you know

887
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,679
being an academic versus being an

888
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,359
entrepreneur which did happen later on

889
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,480
um

890
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
so

891
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,879
the research on um

892
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,960
so okay zcash is based on uh zk snarks

893
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,440
which are based on number theoretic

894
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,000
assumptions uh and you know knowledge of

895
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,839
exponent i'm sure that many of the

896
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,119
viewers here

897
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,760
i know about it a lot more than i do and

898
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
have contributed much to this field um

899
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,520
so you get constructions that are uh

900
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,560
beautiful

901
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,159
from a mathematical

902
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,159
cryptographic point of view

903
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,199
they have a main advantage of

904
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,359
giving you extremely short

905
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,079
proofs under 300 bytes and maybe under

906
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
200 bytes

907
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
but

908
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,079
in terms of the amount of number

909
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,680
theoretic assumptions and other

910
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
assumptions and you know the the

911
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,200
how

912
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,680
how new these assumptions are

913
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
um they are quite in my view quite quite

914
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,000
risky and also

915
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,280
the mathematician in me sort of i mean i

916
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
admire the ability to say here's an

917
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
assumption that you know like knowledge

918
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,520
of exponents and things beyond that to

919
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
sort of uh if you assume that then the

920
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,320
system is secure but coming from the

921
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,079
line of work of pcp is the fact that you

922
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,240
actually have to work really hard and

923
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,920
prove something and prove that it's

924
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,320
secure based on very minimal assumptions

925
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,240
i mean the existence of

926
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,800
any uh hash function collision resistant

927
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,359
hash function which is the case with

928
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,320
starks and other pcp based constructions

929
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
uh really is something that that

930
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,000
drew me in and sort of i i wanted to

931
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
see that line of sort of pcp-based

932
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,440
research uh reach its uh fruition and

933
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,400
here

934
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,240
there was this um

935
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,359
theme that i

936
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,640
i think

937
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
continues till today both a little bit

938
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,800
in the academic world and outside the

939
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,079
academic world which is that um since uh

940
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
pairing-based snarks were first and they

941
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,200
do a lot of things really good

942
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,839
it's once again extremely hard so so i

943
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,520
sort of felt that i'm back in this

944
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
desert again so trying to

945
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,119
peddle

946
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,520
things that are uh things like starks

947
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,359
and things based on interactive oracle

948
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,280
proofs where there's a lot more

949
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,079
math and a lot less

950
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,000
number theoretic assumptions

951
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
is something that the

952
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,440
again the community is not so much

953
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,560
interested in hearing and

954
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
here it was a slightly different or

955
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
other sets of communities so now this

956
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
sort of again i had this experience of

957
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,359
walking the desert in the sense that um

958
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,599
on the one hand by now the the

959
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,359
constructions were already extremely

960
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,640
concrete um extremely practical so by

961
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,400
now we've completely left the world of

962
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,599
of uh

963
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,720
of pcps as they would be appearing in

964
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,000
let's say stock and fox and ccc and

965
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,160
there you can't even try to get anything

966
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
accepted but the world of you know

967
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,920
useless security um s p

968
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,560
um

969
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,240
ccs um

970
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
crypto

971
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,040
no admission there uh at all

972
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
because we already have uh once again i

973
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
think it's a little bit of this orthodox

974
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,720
here i mean we already have

975
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
constructions are really really good

976
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
everyone understands them everyone's

977
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,599
working on them

978
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,480
why

979
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,560
you know why are you uh

980
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,960
why are you bringing these things so

981
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,079
um and there i i remember so i once

982
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,480
complained to gil segev about that and

983
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,119
he

984
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,200
uh i mean was i think after the third or

985
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,480
fourth rejection of the stark paper from

986
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,160
some theory you know

987
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,720
crypto conference um or just before it

988
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,520
and he's and he quoted money no who told

989
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
him he was his

990
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,880
phd advisor and and he told himse that

991
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
um

992
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
you know you're on to something only

993
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
when your papers get rejected uh where

994
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
they're they're said to be not new not

995
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
correct and not interesting so i

996
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
remember coming back to a few weeks

997
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,440
later

998
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,680
forwarding the next rejection set of

999
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
rejections and said i think i'm on to

1000
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,440
something pretty cool because just look

1001
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,280
at this here's uh you know here are the

1002
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
rejections saying it's not interesting

1003
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,720
here's the they're saying that it's not

1004
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,200
new and here they're saying that it's uh

1005
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,560
not correct

1006
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,640
and it happened several times

1007
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,440
so once again sort of back to the desert

1008
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,720
um

1009
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,800
in in a different kind of uh

1010
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
setting in community

1011
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,440
um

1012
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,800
but by then

1013
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
you know

1014
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
we were already

1015
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,599
pretty convinced that this is a

1016
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
meaningful uh

1017
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,720
path to go down

1018
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
so

1019
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,119
another kind i mean i'm focusing only on

1020
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,359
sort of the hardships here right but

1021
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,720
another

1022
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,040
set of hardships came when i

1023
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,359
uh started to co-found the company i was

1024
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,359
a at the time a

1025
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,720
full professor at technion uh by now i i

1026
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,760
left

1027
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,960
in between

1028
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,560
um there was a lawsuit against myself my

1029
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,520
wife my father my phd student who was a

1030
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,880
co-founder um it was resolved since then

1031
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,079
but uh

1032
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,640
sort of the um

1033
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,079
the uh the challenge of uh

1034
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,680
dealing with uh

1035
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,920
academic institutions in the areas of

1036
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,400
computer science is another area that

1037
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
could uh at least that well okay in my

1038
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
institution at the time

1039
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,280
it could could have benefited from a

1040
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,839
more uh

1041
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
enlightened approach i would say or at

1042
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,800
least uh something that sort of more uh

1043
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,240
embraces and and uh allows uh academics

1044
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
to move forward

1045
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
with uh with their entrepreneurship

1046
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,240
so that's another area of sort of

1047
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,000
challenges and so on

1048
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,359
i just want to ask how much time do we

1049
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,839
have left

1050
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,079
so we have about five minutes for the

1051
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,520
scheduled session but we could go

1052
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
slightly over

1053
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,599
uh okay

1054
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,119
so

1055
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,520
um yeah i can go for like three more

1056
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,680
minutes and then if there are questions

1057
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
um

1058
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,079
so three and a half years ago i um

1059
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
decided to go and uh

1060
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
you know sort of leave the academic life

1061
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,000
and start star queer

1062
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,839
um

1063
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,680
and you know i talked a lot about the

1064
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,599
challenges mostly again because so most

1065
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,200
of my talks usually are not about the

1066
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
challenges and the uh you know the

1067
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
things that are hard and so on and i

1068
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,599
just want to say that in general

1069
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,119
um

1070
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,359
i i think

1071
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,800
first of all

1072
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
i really love this quote attributed to

1073
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
winston churchill that says that uh

1074
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,599
success

1075
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,640
is going from failure to failure without

1076
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,680
losing enthusiasm so i think this is

1077
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,280
true even for people who are doing

1078
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,520
academic research because we are faced

1079
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
with such you know we're we're looking

1080
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,880
into these questions that are just so

1081
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,359
hard to solve so you have to wake up day

1082
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,839
after day and experience failure and

1083
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,640
basically go on with your enthusiasm and

1084
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
uh

1085
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,160
you know i i the person i learned this

1086
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,280
most from was my um phd advisor

1087
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,839
avigdorson i think he's

1088
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,359
you know well known to be among the

1089
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,200
smartest in in

1090
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
in math and computer science but those

1091
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,359
who haven't worked with him don't know

1092
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,400
that

1093
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
as much as he is smart he is even more

1094
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
optimistic enthusiastic

1095
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,839
so having you know experienced one

1096
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,359
failure after the other just comes

1097
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,920
charging again at it so

1098
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,839
i'll just end with um you know a few

1099
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,400
words on the differences between

1100
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,359
what i see in academics and

1101
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,079
entrepreneurship so

1102
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,640
you see extremely smart people in in

1103
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,000
both worlds and extremely curious and uh

1104
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,640
and resourceful um

1105
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
i think really the sort of difference is

1106
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,800
that

1107
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
or the differences are

1108
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
that um in

1109
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,040
scientific research

1110
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,440
your aim is to go for the

1111
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,599
outer limits of what is possible and

1112
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,520
just show that you know maybe something

1113
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
can be done

1114
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,760
and that's your focus whereas in in

1115
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,880
business

1116
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,520
the key to success is finding

1117
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,480
the

1118
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,800
something like a minimal viable product

1119
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
so it's the minimal

1120
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,960
use case of your technology that does

1121
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,319
something a little bit better than the

1122
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,560
rest and and you can already

1123
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
do something useful with it so that's

1124
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,839
one big difference

1125
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,520
another big difference on a personal

1126
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,200
level is like

1127
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,560
loneliness versus team so academics

1128
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,400
especially ones doing theoretical

1129
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,640
computer science like i have

1130
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,280
do it pretty much alone day by day and

1131
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,839
it's also very um

1132
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,760
competitive on a personal level so it's

1133
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,359
you know me against the rest of the

1134
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,599
world or me and maybe my students and my

1135
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,040
two or three colleagues

1136
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
whereas in um

1137
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,440
in in business it's always this team and

1138
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,680
this team grows larger and larger i mean

1139
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,000
by now starker has 50

1140
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
employees uh and and everything is

1141
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
i mean your focus and your pride is on

1142
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,280
on the team so that's another difference

1143
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,680
now of course the team comes with its uh

1144
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,960
you know

1145
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,040
they're human beings so now that there

1146
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,800
are you know things like

1147
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,400
egos and personal ambitions and and they

1148
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,720
show up a lot more academics are a bit a

1149
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,520
little bit more like uh cats or bears

1150
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
right you can all go and you know

1151
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,720
be territorial in your own area and you

1152
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,400
meet once in a while in a conference and

1153
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,280
then go and part ways

1154
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,920
another one is the difference between

1155
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
the ability to plan ahead uh and sort of

1156
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,359
just go after your heart so with

1157
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,280
research you're basically going from one

1158
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,920
thing to the next and in a team so i

1159
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,680
still remember this that one of the very

1160
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,359
first meetings when starcraft was

1161
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,240
founded uh we sat with our

1162
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,079
vp of engineering was a very good friend

1163
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,560
of mine for several decades

1164
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,240
and he said

1165
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,880
and at the time most of the knowledge of

1166
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,839
you know the technical knowledge resided

1167
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,480
only with uh with me and my

1168
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
you know other co-founders and they

1169
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
looked at us and said okay so

1170
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,119
please put a plan for the next three

1171
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,800
months of you know what are the first

1172
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,119
five people gonna do

1173
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,160
and i was

1174
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
amazed like what do you mean people

1175
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,520
actually

1176
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,079
can solve this problem of planning for

1177
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,520
five peoples what to do in the next

1178
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,640
three months

1179
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,119
so uh the sort of

1180
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,200
the need to plan and orchestrate large

1181
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,720
groups is something that you see very

1182
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,000
much

1183
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,359
in the um

1184
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
you know in the practical world but

1185
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
don't have it in academics

1186
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,480
and uh the last thing which is similar

1187
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,520
that you need the you know optimism

1188
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
brilliance grit and seeing things

1189
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,119
through is really really important in

1190
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,680
both of them so i see like sort of i

1191
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,119
went to a different world but i feel

1192
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,720
that i'm still very much

1193
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,960
left and you know residing within the

1194
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,560
same uh universe as before

1195
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,599
um

1196
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,040
so it looks like we have a question in

1197
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,359
the chat from from kevin before we

1198
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,200
before we wrap up here

1199
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,680
um so he says his perception is that

1200
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,200
cryptocurrencies still have a ways to go

1201
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,880
in practicality because a very few of

1202
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
the world's transactions are conducted

1203
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,960
this way what is the barrier to adoption

1204
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
of them as a currency by the population

1205
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,040
at large

1206
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,880
yeah so that's a really terrific

1207
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,079
question because uh

1208
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,200
actually i think uh

1209
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,079
so

1210
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,200
there are several things that need to

1211
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,440
happen i mean some regulatory things uh

1212
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,119
and so on but that's not so much of

1213
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,000
interest

1214
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,920
uh the biggest thing that that is

1215
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,440
impending them right now is is scale

1216
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,640
and

1217
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
i haven't this was a talk mostly about

1218
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,119
uh just you know personal travails and

1219
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
failures because that's the nature of

1220
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,000
this conference but uh what

1221
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,920
the technology that starkware is doing

1222
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,040
and that

1223
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,440
you know i co-invented and

1224
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,520
all my research was about was is about

1225
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
using proofs of computational integrity

1226
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,119
in in order to exponentially scale the

1227
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,760
amount of transactions on blockchains

1228
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,040
and uh i'll end with words of success so

1229
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,440
by now we processed over a million

1230
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,319
transactions uh on the blockchain uh

1231
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,119
we've settled more than i think two or

1232
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,040
three billion dollars worth of

1233
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
transactions we're seeing sort of this

1234
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,960
uh hockey stick

1235
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,599
rise in the number of of of transactions

1236
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,560
that are residing on our technology

1237
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,880
which does allow to scale we can reach a

1238
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
transaction per second rate that is

1239
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,760
three to four orders of magnitude higher

1240
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
than what blockchains natively can do

1241
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,160
and all of that without breaking any any

1242
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,200
of the security assumptions of of that

1243
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,079
uh of you know blockchains which is

1244
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,359
a different talk that i'll give some

1245
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,560
other time so uh my the stuff i want to

1246
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,800
talk wanted to talk about failures and

1247
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,359
you know keeping on and moving from

1248
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,520
academics to

1249
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,359
entrepreneurship that's

1250
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,520
i'm done

1251
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,119
uh and i think we have another question

1252
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,319
from carla

1253
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,400
and a vote from stewart to continue so

1254
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,920
we will we will take that to heart

1255
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,200
so

1256
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,040
you said at the beginning that

1257
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,440
you were it's very hard to find

1258
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,559
use cases beyond blockchains but do you

1259
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,960
think this will change when

1260
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
when as as it really becomes very

1261
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,920
efficient because personally the way i

1262
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,720
view all of these proofs is like solving

1263
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
a very fundamental cryptographic problem

1264
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,520
which is how you get usability when you

1265
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,000
have confidentiality right so

1266
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,359
i i see this as going beyond like not in

1267
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,880
the maybe not

1268
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,040
short term or something

1269
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
yeah i completely agree with you but i

1270
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
think the main hurdle is not so much

1271
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
like efficiency it is actually sort of

1272
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
the basic premise

1273
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,000
of the conventional world so the way the

1274
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
world solves these problems of

1275
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,240
confidentiality and so on is to say we

1276
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,880
will take a trusted party um we will

1277
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,119
entrust it with all the information and

1278
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,119
it will run this computation on behalf

1279
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,200
of everyone and we'll do so efficiently

1280
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,520
and we'll trust it and this has been

1281
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,760
going on for millennia and it works very

1282
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,520
well it's extremely efficient and in

1283
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,760
most cases if that party is indeed you

1284
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,240
know honest which often it is this works

1285
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,280
very well

1286
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,319
so

1287
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,319
that's the main hurdle that you need

1288
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,480
because any sort of proof or secure

1289
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,240
multi-party computation it's going to be

1290
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,559
much less efficient in terms of the you

1291
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
know cpu time so either you're going to

1292
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,119
see that uh governments are going to

1293
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,559
demand that and the public is going to

1294
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,800
demand that or the blockchain sort of

1295
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,880
become the thing you know that sort of

1296
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
decentralized

1297
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,119
world that becomes so prevalent that

1298
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,359
everyone needs it but i don't think you

1299
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,960
know any bank anytime soon is going to

1300
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,800
say oh we're going to prove stuff to our

1301
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
users we're going to trust them with

1302
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,160
their stuff and they're going to prove

1303
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,839
it to us i don't see that happening

1304
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,280
that's going to be a major disruption

1305
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,440
that's going to come

1306
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,319
as a disruption

1307
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,680
and we have another question uh from

1308
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,280
felix in the chat

1309
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
says as i see it blockchain startups

1310
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,800
aren't a decent way to bridge the theory

1311
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,960
practice gap of zero knowledge proofs do

1312
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,480
you know of another business field where

1313
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,000
other areas of cryptography could be

1314
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,880
bridged to practice

1315
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,760
that's a terrific question i would say

1316
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,800
but again i'm i'm okay i think okay zero

1317
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,839
knowledge is is basically just the basic

1318
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,960
layer of it's like one-sided npc where

1319
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,000
alice

1320
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,319
has all of the secrets that in the

1321
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,800
secure multi-party computation so

1322
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,440
definitely um i think the next thing

1323
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,359
that hasn't really started that much yet

1324
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,839
would be npc for for things like you

1325
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,680
know auctions and you know these

1326
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,000
settings that the dark pools and things

1327
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,839
like that

1328
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:14,640
um everyone's talking about fhe which of

1329
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,720
course sort of complements and it's very

1330
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,839
strong and then you have industry with

1331
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,280
indistinguishability obfuscation

1332
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,200
um

1333
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,119
those probably would come

1334
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,359
later on i don't know i mean

1335
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,960
it's not it's a terrific question i'm

1336
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
not the right person to ask another area

1337
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,040
that i think is gaining a lot of

1338
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,480
popularity is

1339
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,520
differential privacy and related to it

1340
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
but there i think there's still research

1341
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,880
needed to be done which is this whole

1342
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,240
notion of the algorithmic fairness uh

1343
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,280
which is a

1344
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,400
very important topic in society it's i

1345
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,520
mean it's not clear exactly what

1346
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,720
areas of crypto touch on that but

1347
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,000
so i would say

1348
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,440
mpc next thing fhe i don't know maybe

1349
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,000
everyone's talking about it but uh

1350
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,319
seems a bit harder and then differential

1351
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,920
privacy and

1352
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,440
but i would say that i

1353
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,680
that in those cases as well it's not

1354
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,839
going to be just pure standard there's

1355
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,920
there's a very non-trivial task that we

1356
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,720
also have to do with proofs of finding

1357
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,319
where is the right place to put the

1358
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,640
technology it's not the uh i mean a lot

1359
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,240
of talks start with oh delegation of

1360
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
computation right there's a cloud you

1361
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
need you don't trust it so on it doesn't

1362
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,599
practically uh it doesn't work that way

1363
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,000
no one doesn't uh you know no one cares

1364
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,520
about no one needs to verify amazon's

1365
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,040
work using the proof

1366
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,520
practically speaking so so you need

1367
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,800
there as well i think you're going to

1368
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,520
need to find a creative way to insert

1369
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
those technologies differential privacy

1370
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,200
fhe and so on

1371
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,640
just to know for those of you outside

1372
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,280
the us differential privacy is involved

1373
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,839
in the u.s sense of census data this

1374
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,760
time around and there is a huge lawsuit

1375
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,319
going on where states are actually suing

1376
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,040
the the u.s census bureau about the use

1377
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
of adding randomness claiming that it's

1378
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,520
making the stats inaccurate um so that's

1379
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,440
a very interesting and it's been great

1380
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,640
to sort of see

1381
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,640
theoreticians get involved in writing

1382
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,880
briefs and arguments uh about that so

1383
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,119
there's some great uh pieces written by

1384
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,839
cryptographers involved in differential

1385
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,240
privacy explaining this to um to the

1386
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,920
general sort of like consumer audience

1387
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,440
so i would encourage people to check

1388
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,720
that out if you haven't seen it

1389
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,319
um so thank you so much for for joining

1390
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,160
us and being willing to share some of

1391
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,400
your your journey and your failures and

1392
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,200
your

1393
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,599
hopefully many more successes to come

1394
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,880
um and uh if everyone

1395
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,400
just for scheduling purposes will be

1396
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,960
back here at 2pm uh in the meantime

1397
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,280
there is a women researchers panel going

1398
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,680
on so it just started so feel free to

1399
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,200
head over to that and let's thank our

1400
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,520
speaker one more time thank you so much

1401
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,040
thank you thank you for having me

1402
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,500
