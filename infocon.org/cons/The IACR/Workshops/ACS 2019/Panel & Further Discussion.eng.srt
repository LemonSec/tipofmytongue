1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,549
thank you everyone for joining we have

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,919
the opportunity and I'm very honored to

3
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:16,759
be sitting in this table right now with

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,849
these amazing cryptographers and people

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,849
[Music]

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,100
so I'm not gonna introduce them because

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,850
I'm going to ask them to introduce

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,940
themselves but you probably know most of

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,809
them if not all of them so thank you the

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:44,739
fur to the five of you to be here we had

11
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:47,870
this idea of having all this day going

12
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,760
going to talks and learning about what

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,559
the different standard efforts are doing

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,149
and so on and we thought you know what

15
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,459
what is the best way to conclude the day

16
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,409
well we can't get everybody here to

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,059
start working on standards because there

18
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:00,670
is too little time and too many topics

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,039
so we thought you know let's have a

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,310
conversation and see what is the what

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,789
are the kind of hardest part of creating

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,770
a standard and so on so we offered you

23
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:15,020
know just ask to have a couple of

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,630
minutes each to introduce yourself and

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,030
tell us a bit what's your encounter with

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,759
the standardization and if you have any

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:30,829
anecdote that you find is worth maybe

28
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:38,119
bringing up one stack ok google'

29
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:42,919
krafchick I'd consider one with a lot of

30
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:46,609
experience in standards I've been

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:58,729
involved with with the IDF since mid

32
00:01:46,609 --> 00:02:02,149
nineties you guys were there and I

33
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,030
wasn't in his talk so I don't know what

34
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,950
version of I think that's he talk but in

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,009
the 90s it was very hard to work in the

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,840
IDF for someone that was talking about

37
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:16,970
rules

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,269
and definitions stuff like that so it

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:27,650
was not an easy time but I'm a stubborn

40
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:31,819
person and somehow then the h mark came

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:38,660
at a time in which md5 it was started

42
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:42,290
breaking md5 and what's the name TT TT a

43
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,569
German researcher that people hear too

44
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:49,160
young but he he had the first words on

45
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:53,720
basically breaking or showing some

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:03:00,349
weaknesses of md5 and so the time that

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:04,790
we were trying to promote H mark he he

48
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:07,280
came with his work and I so I sent him

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,720
emails saying do you think that you can

50
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,340
break H much with md5 under your attacks

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,950
the answer was no I have no idea I'm

52
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,700
fickle can do that so I asked him can I

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,530
send this to the IPSec said yes and I

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,630
think that was the most important part

55
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,730
in getting these accepted but the reason

56
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,829
I'm telling this is because actually the

57
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:36,230
fact that there was a proof in H mark

58
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:39,859
became an important point in in this

59
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,369
history of trying really to move crypto

60
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:50,209
in practice clip the practice into more

61
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:52,430
theoretical of well-founded science one

62
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,250
did say that you were pushing for the

63
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,590
security part of the of the standard

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:05,540
like that yeah he said that he mentioned

65
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:08,959
my friend bill Simpson he has he had the

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,190
famous sentence saying that he doesn't

67
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,488
talk to self or self-proclaimed

68
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,700
cryptographers anyway that's about an

69
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,700
agreement

70
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:27,470
so hi I'm Dolly monkey and currently

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,390
from Makkah Libra and definitely not

72
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,670
that photographer so I think that means

73
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm a person was actually why I am on

74
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:40,780
this boundary between so I have interest

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:49,010
in secure systems I'm kind of a boundary

76
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,989
whenever there's a Byzantine failure I'm

77
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,960
interested in it and that means I'm

78
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,040
touching on crypto cryptography

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,219
cryptocurrencies and I guess I have a

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,550
series of life anecdotes that keeps

81
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,170
dragging me into flight crypto at least

82
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,570
or security side of things so it starts

83
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,590
with my postdoc I joined the AT&T Labs

84
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,980
and mic writer at the time who came from

85
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,590
Cornell really wanted me to join that he

86
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,450
was working in a security group so I

87
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,429
joined the security group I was the only

88
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,770
non applied cryptography they're the

89
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,340
only person the only person the only

90
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,370
person then I assume the faculty

91
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,700
position at the Hebrew University after

92
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,170
and again distributed systems person but

93
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,000
there was nobody to teach the intro to

94
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,230
cryptography and the advanced of course

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,790
in cryptography at the time because

96
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,610
every witness of left for sabbatical and

97
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,020
Michael was doing quantum computing

98
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,000
every time and Michael Robin was

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,740
spending all this time at Harvard so

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,090
they asked me to teach the courses I had

101
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:06,200
to teach the security courses and then

102
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:08,279
while I was there is complexity theorist

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,679
and later

104
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,109
game theory nothing today with

105
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:18,539
photography and me nothing to do with

106
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:21,179
cryptography either our daughters took

107
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,399
swimming lessons together so we would

108
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:26,729
sit by the pool no no I mean I'm

109
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:29,399
watching them swimming and chatting

110
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,159
about computer science and at some point

111
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,909
they we the girls started pulling each

112
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:38,039
other underwater and you know I'm jumped

113
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,199
and save them and all that and somehow

114
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,719
out of that came Fairplay you know the

115
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,539
system that says isn't it time to to

116
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,369
actually see if we can practically

117
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,229
implement secure multi-party computation

118
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:53,249
and just how expensive that is

119
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,860
so so that's how I get into that area

120
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:59,459
and I can continue but this is you know

121
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,999
this is very personal my story I kept

122
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,999
being dragged

123
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,479
I'm around Romer I'm a professor of

124
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,729
computer science at Tel Aviv University

125
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,969
and the research scientist at Columbia

126
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:26,128
University let me share my origin story

127
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:31,739
how I got my powers was the spider so I

128
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:34,110
used to be person so I was working I was

129
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:36,209
already on this slippery slope to become

130
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,739
a cryptographer working on side-channel

131
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:40,860
attacks and cache attacks in the search

132
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:43,948
I got wondering it was this theory about

133
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,360
your knowledge proof impossibility

134
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,019
results for complexity that's what's

135
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,379
that good for

136
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:55,079
well maybe it's good for proving the

137
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,709
integrity of computation as it was

138
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:01,769
envisioned before it became theoretical

139
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,539
complexity theory tool and maybe the

140
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,099
kind of verifying integrity of

141
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,469
computation that your knowledge groups

142
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,860
can do can be a way to mitigate the

143
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,900
attacks that we were studying

144
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,490
if you cannot trust the computing

145
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,859
platform because of various physical

146
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,530
attacks maybe you can just make it prove

147
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,150
to you that it operated correctly and

148
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,349
maybe you can actually implement this by

149
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,489
building on if they were any company's

150
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:28,160
nodes so that's kind of cool so I was at

151
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,900
MIT any time we took it to the NSF we

152
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,270
submitted the proposal and the response

153
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,549
came back that nope no way this will

154
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,980
ever work but you know what in this

155
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,319
every date work it would be kind of

156
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,700
useful so here are a few dollars don't

157
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,940
spend them all in one place they have a

158
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:51,340
sugar program for exploratory research

159
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:59,440
keeps you just above the water actually

160
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:59,440
started picking pace he teamed up with

161
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,490
to actually use the cutting edge PCB

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,710
techniques to build it even further and

163
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,980
to get some prototypes one thing led to

164
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,540
another and we actually showed various

165
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,180
way by which you know which boots can

166
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,969
actually work and we say great so now

167
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,589
the problem is solved all this saved we

168
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,110
can go back to our Batcave or whatever

169
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,060
and do theoretical research because

170
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,520
everybody will just pick up these zero

171
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,260
knowledge and use it well nothing

172
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,699
happened in that regard and so we

173
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,140
started looking for applications or self

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,570
is starting bitching around and we heard

175
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,270
about that new thing Bitcoin that sort

176
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,250
of had privacy but didn't and if we only

177
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,160
use your knowledge proves maybe we could

178
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,640
make it have real privacy so we teamed

179
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,260
up with people working on that and we

180
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,949
published a zero cash paper which was

181
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,319
one of the first plausibly real all-news

182
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,080
applications of your knowledge proofs

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
and we said ok now surely everybody will

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,520
use it and we can go back to the lab and

185
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,170
do our stuff because blockchain right

186
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,300
and not even heaven either

187
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,550
because no one knew what is that what

188
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,900
the way they call it the moon math of

189
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,550
the old knowledge proves how can you

190
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,920
ever trust it no one would ever use it

191
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,050
wait

192
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,140
so we had to roll up our sleeves and

193
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,240
create a new company to actually do the

194
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,000
engineering to deploy this it became the

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,279
second script of currency which is alive

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,960
and well and there's a whole bunch of

197
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,910
other cryptocurrencies that forked off

198
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,790
for this and many other projects that

199
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,709
were inspired by it to use your

200
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,279
knowledge proves in numerous other

201
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,960
applications whether blockchain or other

202
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,730
Daniel is from Canada company that

203
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,190
commercializes these applications in the

204
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,330
enterprise context for disclosure right

205
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:51,520
like them and there are many others and

206
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:55,690
this is why I'm sitting here because

207
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,760
those your knowledge proves that no

208
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,550
never work but if they did might

209
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,140
actually be useful I have become useful

210
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,189
I've seen many application and we would

211
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,370
like to make sure that the using it

212
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,220
right

213
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,470
hello everyone my name is Luis Brando I

214
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,940
guess if the time to talk is

215
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,580
proportional to the experience I'll have

216
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,250
just a little bit of time I'm I haven't

217
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:26,380
been around for that long I finished my

218
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:28,900
PhD in 2016 as a cryptographer I gave my

219
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:33,640
my core area is secured two-party

220
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,420
computation as I was doing my PhD I did

221
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,839
I

222
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm originally from Portugal I did a PhD

223
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,270
between Lisbon Portugal and Pittsburgh

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,280
Pennsylvania in the West and while I was

225
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:49,420
in the u.s. I had the opportunity to do

226
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,150
a short summer visit at NIST and that's

227
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,270
where I met Renee who who I mostly work

228
00:11:52,150 --> 00:12:00,250
with now we match very well in terms of

229
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:02,380
interests related to privacy and while I

230
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,770
was still doing my PhD Renee came with a

231
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,010
problem where basically the government

232
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:12,260
is trying to implement a system of

233
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:14,090
brokered identification where

234
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,569
it's gonna make everything easier

235
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,060
because you can have now citizens

236
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,670
identifying to relying parties with the

237
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,930
help of identity providers but because

238
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:28,430
there's a privacy constraint where the

239
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,670
identity provider should not know where

240
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,109
the where the person is going to the

241
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,469
government is trying to solve that by

242
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,120
putting some entity in the middle that

243
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,250
is gonna mediate everything so that now

244
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,340
that interpreters don't know where the

245
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,980
citizens are going and it's like we look

246
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,590
at this okay sure but was the was the

247
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,040
person in the middle and it would be a

248
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,810
government controlled entity and so that

249
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,930
will ended up actually being quite an

250
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,670
interesting problem to look at from the

251
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,150
perspective of privacy were actually

252
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,520
skew computation ended up providing

253
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,319
quite an interesting result showing that

254
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,970
okay even if you have to have a that

255
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,650
person in the middle because of it's

256
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,660
very well justified you can actually

257
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,760
make sure that it's not going to learn

258
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,680
anything about the transactions that are

259
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,020
going to happen anyway this is how I got

260
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,979
connected to NIST and Rene and then once

261
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:29,449
I finished my my PhD I kind of this

262
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,400
looks a nice place to to try out and so

263
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,920
here I am for the for the past two years

264
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,810
just to try maybe a little bit of

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,250
anecdote this was just a few months ago

266
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,349
and this just to mention something about

267
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,060
I mean I think it's something always

268
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,600
present mainly in conference is the

269
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,310
aspect of NIST like oh you're working at

270
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
NIST like are you one of the good guys

271
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,650
or one of the bad guys interestingly an

272
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,040
interesting interaction a few months ago

273
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:01,280
at a conference in Europe you know just

274
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,439
coffee time saying hello to people and I

275
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,089
say hello to this person and then kind

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,400
of just showing the name oh and the

277
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,550
person just in oh you're at NIST I'm so

278
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,069
sorry for you

279
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,979
and I'm like oh really why is that oh

280
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,910
because nist sabotaging standards etc

281
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,200
etc and actually I had it quite a quick

282
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,750
answer I just occurred to me to say oh

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,480
well then I guess I'm glad I'm there to

284
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,190
make sure that doesn't happen anymore or

285
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,740
at least that I can help that not happen

286
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,480
so it does it does feel to me that

287
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,440
actually being at NIST is is an

288
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,380
interesting place to be to indeed bring

289
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,390
in some interest for privacy and really

290
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,400
making sure that we're doing good

291
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,160
standards but of course don't trust my

292
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,829
words but but that's what it is that's

293
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,569
what I'm trying to do and it does look

294
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,690
like very as I was saying in the

295
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,990
presentation earlier this morning even

296
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:57,060
though I may not have a large enough

297
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,520
historical perspective of things I do

298
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,540
think I bring a fresh perspective for

299
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,430
some things and I do

300
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,750
I really feel excited about looking that

301
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,459
this is the time where some of these

302
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,550
things what we're calling advanced

303
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,640
cryptography is coming about in terms of

304
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:20,280
standardisation so it's it's a cool time

305
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,720
to be here alright so my name is Tonya

306
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,780
Langer from the universe Tecna

307
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,280
University in Eindhoven unlike my course

308
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,569
because I don't know why I'm here but

309
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,030
since I have the board anyway I might

310
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,610
tell smilin toads so growing up in

311
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,680
Europe in cryptography we've always been

312
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,230
looking at the standards ie

313
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,599
missus - and as a standards as something

314
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,330
which is probably there in order to be

315
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,520
against us so we've been always looking

316
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,430
at those things as something were okay

317
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,689
figure out what it's like we always knew

318
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,359
there'd be a little bit paranoid but

319
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,070
well it was not the good feeling hey

320
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,380
this is something sanitized it's good it

321
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,120
was more like hmm are they trying to

322
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,900
shove something down our throats which

323
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,850
is helping them spy on us well and then

324
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,220
some years later Snowden came around and

325
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,120
well at least there were some which were

326
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,620
made to be well looking well not in

327
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,510
order to make us more secure but in

328
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,200
order to make it possible for them

329
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,670
whoever they them are to look at what

330
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,350
we're doing and get information they

331
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,209
were not supposed to do now my first

332
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,900
step at that point was do a lot of

333
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,330
archaeology

334
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,810
so I spent a long time digging through

335
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,800
all the FOIA requests about dual EC so

336
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,569
if you want to learn more about the

337
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,079
history how it was possible that these

338
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,210
things happened if you saw the project

339
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,280
will run releases then there's like the

340
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,780
NSA bragging about an exercise in

341
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,260
finesse and you go like yeah okay fine

342
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,819
show me what it is I mean this is their

343
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,290
annual report and when you tell your

344
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,670
boss hey I did well please give me a

345
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,760
race you will also say hey it wasn't

346
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,550
exercising finesse but actually Wars now

347
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,990
digging through all the details is that

348
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:59,130
the way that these standards work in a

349
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:01,970
particular thing that I saw is somebody

350
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,740
has to write this document and then

351
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:09,120
magic somebody is willing to take it

352
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,250
over and do all the work and so what

353
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,409
happened at that point was that the US

354
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,410
representative says well look you just

355
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,810
got another 40 pages of feedback with

356
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,339
lots of nitpicky remarks and the Germans

357
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,480
don't like this definition and the

358
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,450
French and the British and they're all

359
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,130
complaining how about this he is our new

360
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,480
and shiny and nice is written and we

361
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,000
already did the work of formatting it

362
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,170
the right way in Izu style which is not

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,970
the way you would write your things but

364
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:37,110
it looks like I just saw how about this

365
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:41,760
I know but I said oh yeah sure that's an

366
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,270
exercise in finesse just preying on the

367
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,740
laziness of people okay so it was a

368
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,420
little funny I could give some talks

369
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,280
about it I could show how this is a

370
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,960
backdoor we showed how the backdoor

371
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,210
could be exploited in in real life

372
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,100
because direct out there and it's a was

373
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,240
going like well I'll buy your beer if

374
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,600
you can show that this actually is

375
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,720
usable you never fold up on that but

376
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,100
then it's fun but it doesn't get you

377
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,650
anywhere it doesn't make the world safer

378
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,300
and so eventually I was like fine I

379
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,360
probably have to roll up my sleeves and

380
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,100
actually go to those meetings and yep

381
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,510
it's still the same if anybody is

382
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,379
willing to do something they get a

383
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,030
shitload of work so well please join and

384
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,270
help so that the next thing that's a

385
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:27,360
better and please join only if your name

386
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,670
tag doesn't say NSA or know that you

387
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,309
can't say that but

388
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,920
we need more eyes on this we need more

389
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,510
people who actually have the background

390
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,160
because normally people who have time to

391
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,920
go to standardization bodies I don't

392
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,290
really have time to go there and I can't

393
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,179
go to all of them and it's so easy to

394
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,240
slip some and when you look at ISO for

395
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,500
instance I've now been to other meetings

396
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,820
there are now a bunch of cartographers

397
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,710
in the room at the SC 2712 JTC 1/sc 27

398
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,450
working group 2 which is meant to be the

399
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,520
one for doing crypto standards and

400
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,170
there's a good number of people with

401
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,668
different interests and I'm happy to see

402
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,350
the NSA there and happy to see the

403
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,090
Russians there and the Chinese and so on

404
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,409
and a whole bunch of free world

405
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,120
cryptographers and we are all keeping

406
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,970
each other in check and reviewing things

407
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,129
but even this is one working group there

408
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,260
is a huge flood of documents I can't

409
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,990
possibly keep up on all of them maybe

410
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,910
together we can but then there are other

411
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,370
eyes working groups so there is the ISO

412
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,929
working group on financial standards so

413
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,909
the financial system has their own

414
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,740
crypto things there is something on

415
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,780
small devices there's something on this

416
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,010
and this and this and it turns out that

417
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,418
if your crypto can't get into the SC 27

418
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,559
working group - you can just go to

419
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,419
working group 3 for instance qkd which

420
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,850
several of us have some loath against

421
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,830
didn't manage to get into working group

422
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,409
- and so now they're trying to get into

423
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,530
working group 3 which is actually there

424
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,700
once there is a standard that they

425
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,559
determine how to qualify and how to

426
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,790
measure this well they skip in the

427
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,250
standard part and they just go into

428
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,590
three and probably every customer will

429
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:05,010
just say oh stand ISO standardized check

430
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,110
that's fine so it's a huge time sink but

431
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,020
if each of us maybe does a little bit we

432
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,729
can do it now the reason why I'm saying

433
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,520
I have no idea why I'm on this panel is

434
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,500
that my normal work is low level or trip

435
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,690
- trying to get signatures encryption

436
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,220
stuff right I dabbled a little bit in

437
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,290
higher level protocols have done some

438
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,820
pairings and such during most oppose

439
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,700
qualms these days

440
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,460
so I can't really help much with the

441
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,020
fancy stuff but then again the lessons

442
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,460
learned on being on those

443
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,500
standardization meetings is probably

444
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,740
similar to what we encounter elsewhere

445
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,679
and well maybe if each of us does a

446
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,700
little bit it can work so just to kind

447
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,320
of address these

448
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,270
I don't know why I'm here like I think

449
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,100
you're behind somebody I'm really

450
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,720
answering your own question like we want

451
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,610
to bring all these people from different

452
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,040
walks of life right I think Louis was

453
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,320
sorry Ron Ron was mentioning this this

454
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,360
morning that it's important to bring you

455
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,939
know people from theory from from there

456
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,350
are developing open sores people from

457
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,670
advanced cryptography not advanced

458
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,659
cryptography people that work in Stan

459
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,060
there's people that don't work in

460
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,960
standards and all all walks of life in

461
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,270
some sense but but these also kind of

462
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,480
brings me to to think a bit in retro

463
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:19,720
actively as to the difference that I at

464
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,280
least seen in some sense from the past

465
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,990
way of doing standardized

466
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,910
standardization at least in cryptography

467
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,390
and the new way and I think I want to

468
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,670
ask you like what why are Standards

469
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,980
important if at all right I mean there

470
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,390
is in some instances where they may not

471
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,380
be important there may be taken

472
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:40,270
advantage of and others that not so if I

473
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,650
ask you all that question our standards

474
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:47,530
important when are they important you

475
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,560
want us an order or okay so if anybody

476
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,860
wants to answer please just it depends

477
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,950
so I would say if you need something

478
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,050
where multiple people do something has

479
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,540
to be interoperable it helps to have a

480
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,669
standard if you just need something for

481
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,940
yourself for your own product be it open

482
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,890
source software be a commercial product

483
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,330
and you have the expertise to select

484
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,910
something you don't actually need a

485
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,520
standard and standards will get in your

486
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,440
way in the sense of speed of product

487
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,200
development whatever there is another

488
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,050
place where standards can help namely if

489
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,840
you want to have some certification or

490
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,850
some form of verification at the end of

491
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,490
it there are a bunch of companies which

492
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,919
are well set up to test things that are

493
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,660
in these standards and if something is a

494
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,120
newfangled protocol or newfangled

495
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,760
cryptographic primitives they don't have

496
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,969
the expertise I'm not saying that all of

497
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,320
those things help well I think they help

498
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm not saying that all of those things

499
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,020
work we have seen for instance open SSL

500
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,340
v certified had a sec Fault in something

501
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,650
which should have been tested and

502
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,840
working but there were probably other

503
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,360
things that recording the certification

504
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,389
so some things it helps and some other

505
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,389
things well couldn't be bothered

506
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,930
I guess maybe as a compliment

507
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:15,850
I think a standard is a reference that

508
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:17,650
people can refer to and in good use

509
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,580
cases there's there will certainly be

510
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:24,940
bad use cases robbery in good use cases

511
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,860
they can potentially serve to to be a

512
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,280
reference for best practices so for

513
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,600
example taking the example of threshold

514
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,000
schemes through cryptographic primitives

515
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,060
where one of the goals is to have a way

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,360
of enhancing certain security properties

517
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,720
such as for example better resilience

518
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,850
against key leakage so if there are

519
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,530
scenarios where it's likely that a key

520
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,159
is under attack there's some adversary

521
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:52,629
trying to reach a key then maybe at some

522
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,120
point in the development of these

523
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,620
schemes one can say okay maybe some

524
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,620
threshold schemes would be a best

525
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,320
practice to protect high-value target

526
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,850
keys and so once we have that preference

527
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,919
that's a reference of comparison if

528
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,949
somebody loses a key and was not using

529
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,620
that maybe it's an indication well it

530
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,200
should have been using that possibly

531
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,030
another thing that I think can be a

532
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,950
benefit maybe it's a secondary benefit

533
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,430
but I think it's also relevant related

534
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,040
to Samuels conversation talk today is a

535
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,740
standard may also indeed constitute a

536
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,940
period of higher peer review of a

537
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,020
particular method or operation and it

538
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,480
will probably lead to a better

539
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,639
specification of a particular technique

540
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,550
and that may have its own benefit I

541
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:44,620
guess

542
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:46,690
so in general things products that the

543
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,899
different manufacturers companies

544
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,290
generate underneath we work with each

545
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,440
other

546
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:56,350
require standards so in the case of

547
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,790
cryptography most cryptography really

548
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,800
requires standard in that sense because

549
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,830
you don't want just one company to be

550
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,590
able to produce the products even

551
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,840
different vendors and to interoperate so

552
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,860
in that sense there is this operational

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,010
reason for four four standards but

554
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,850
beyond that in cryptography we want to

555
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:26,129
educate the world not to invent their

556
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:28,990
own crypto if you don't want these

557
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:32,230
companies to invent their own crypto you

558
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:35,530
need to give them the solutions and this

559
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:40,030
is one fundamental reason for first

560
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,560
standards in these in this area and then

561
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:46,210
there is the question of base the issue

562
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:48,490
of best practices which is also somehow

563
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,380
determined by the standards I'm not

564
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,780
saying that all standards actually

565
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,770
standardize on the best practices it's

566
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,320
not necessarily the case but if we want

567
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,800
this to be the case we can help being

568
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:07,179
involved with these things one example

569
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:09,159
of best practice is that so best

570
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,760
practices also in this area are

571
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,160
important for regulations so you know

572
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:20,260
when we people have regulations on

573
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:23,410
privacy or security related stuff then

574
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:27,100
the standards also are a guide for for

575
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:30,040
regulators and Wow I always you know

576
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,290
that now people work on search and

577
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,690
encrypted data for example and there are

578
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,399
different methods one one of them for

579
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,400
range queries is deterministic

580
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,050
order preserving encryption which is an

581
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:47,260
urbanist encryption and therefore not a

582
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,720
great encryption so the question is when

583
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,540
when when a regulation or a law says

584
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,100
that data needs to be encrypted it

585
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,030
doesn't send into encrypted with

586
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,790
semantic security right so the word

587
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:05,170
encrypted is not sufficiently

588
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,570
descriptive if there is a standard to

589
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,900
cite with in relation to that then then

590
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,090
you get a much more more information on

591
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,820
what really is needed are meant

592
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,850
I think another consideration is

593
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:29,110
lowering the barriers to adoption

594
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:31,330
especially for technology we need

595
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,090
standards for the same role that we put

596
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,280
guarding grazin handholds hiking trails

597
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,590
right they may save some experienced

598
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,940
hikers from falling to their death but

599
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,500
also they will encourage less

600
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,580
experienced hikers to take the train in

601
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:50,230
the first place and with the very

602
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,750
complex and nuanced graphic primitives

603
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,120
that we are dealing with here there are

604
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,130
many people who are cognizant of the

605
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,489
dangers of doing it wrong and so with

606
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,160
only start denying if they feel that

607
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,130
it's well one marked another's that we

608
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:12,250
will say from certain death they try to

609
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:13,480
just wing it and this discussion is

610
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,010
important because it shows that there

611
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,450
are different considerations for the

612
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:20,160
different phases of the evolution of the

613
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:22,990
standards the initial ones we are the

614
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,700
informational aspect is crucial whereas

615
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,350
later on it's the normative one that's

616
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,000
essential for interoperability that I

617
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:32,919
believe takes over maybe if I can just

618
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,240
kind of follow up on that it's a great

619
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,820
it's a great point for the next question

620
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,950
but also like when you mean lower the

621
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,740
barriers for adoption it's also in some

622
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,600
sense lower the barriers for entry right

623
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,940
the fact that when you can give this

624
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,070
tool or the standard to someone that is

625
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,510
not doesn't have the money to implement

626
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,450
this stuff maybe we can just take the

627
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,070
standard implement

628
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,340
having to go through a long process

629
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:57,860
right but so in terms of adoption right

630
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,439
we have this kind of question of where

631
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,719
or these tension I would say where in

632
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,570
some cases technology is just being

633
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,580
adopted by companies and that's when

634
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,139
sometimes the motivation to create a

635
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,360
standard comes into place

636
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,940
in other cases you have write an open

637
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,760
source for example projects that sort of

638
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,710
create an ad-hoc standard right so what

639
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,120
really goes first like standard or

640
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:40,580
adoption right this is a big a question

641
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:45,530
that may resonate with some of you but I

642
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:50,449
do want to say one of the advantages but

643
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:52,850
also where I would see a need for you

644
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:59,600
know some drawbacks or some cons for

645
00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:02,330
this is you know fundamentally I agree

646
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,919
with everything with advanced crypto

647
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,699
message that fundamentally are

648
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,940
addressing decentralized trust so

649
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,410
bringing distrusting parties to automate

650
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,480
the processes in the interaction between

651
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,090
them so how can I bring somebody that

652
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,620
doesn't trust me if we don't even agree

653
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,620
on the formats or the standards are the

654
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:24,139
primitives clearly there's that need

655
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,780
there's also need to consider the

656
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:30,440
societal impact of the technologies that

657
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:36,530
we create and if you just let open

658
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:40,040
source ad hoc or even product great fact

659
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:42,040
you know adhoc standards you might not

660
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,190
have the responsibility and the

661
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,240
protection of regulatory oversight and

662
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:53,810
generally you know even economists or

663
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,930
advice as to how to best create

664
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,760
technology that we can be accountable

665
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:06,260
for and that takes into consideration

666
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:10,160
all these aspects related to that is the

667
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:15,500
issue of transparency that's one of the

668
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:18,740
things that you want to provide as much

669
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:22,420
as you can to we we have examples of

670
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,140
NIST is a perfect case of extreme

671
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,230
non-transparency and extreme

672
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:34,970
transparency the non transparency with

673
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:43,520
the famous great transparency in all

674
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:45,920
these competitions so you mean the

675
00:31:43,520 --> 00:32:01,310
period of NIST pre Lewis and post Lewis

676
00:31:45,920 --> 00:32:05,200
I think that anyway in general the issue

677
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:08,090
of transparency and even in cases where

678
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,330
standards are developed in some chaotic

679
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,720
way but with transparency that's that's

680
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:17,330
really some level of assurance no

681
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:25,550
guarantee of something right but at

682
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:27,260
least assurance that things were so I

683
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,690
think guidance is wonderful and

684
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,250
definitely desirable but when I see of

685
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,770
standard I think of something which is

686
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:36,380
unique there's these standards for doing

687
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:39,410
something whereas when I hear guidance

688
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,630
or something new then I think okay fine

689
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,280
a it doesn't mean that we have to

690
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,320
selected which of those it's just like

691
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,120
everybody who does something should also

692
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,100
give guidance and how to implement it

693
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,899
properly

694
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,459
and how to take him to current whatever

695
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,960
sit considerations belong to this

696
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,550
protocol but that to me is not a

697
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:00,250
standard who go since you just mentioned

698
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,659
the pseudo-random generators I mean

699
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,270
that's the one with the dual EC is in

700
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,010
this was in some sense an open process

701
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,560
they had two conferences where people

702
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:11,110
could give feedback but it was not a

703
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,409
competition it was something were missed

704
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:18,459
posted this thing as died post I don't

705
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,720
know 20 or 30 things per year send them

706
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,490
and you can be on the mailing list you

707
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,800
get a notification hey there is a draft

708
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,170
please comment on it but to me this is

709
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,240
more like a denial of service attack I

710
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,910
don't have time to look at all of those

711
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,620
and so in the end I go like yep fine and

712
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,440
the same happens with I so they say

713
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,479
heavens ITF there's too many things and

714
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,770
if we now say won't have even more

715
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,560
standards that means we're spreading

716
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:44,230
even more thinly and so that's what I'm

717
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,169
thinking let's hold back on things let's

718
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,780
do community focus on a few things that

719
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,640
we can actually handle and I'm happy to

720
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,200
see miss during post quantum happy to

721
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,320
see miss doom lightweight I'm happy to

722
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,730
see Miss doing advanced crypto but does

723
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,510
NIST and does the community actually

724
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:04,570
have enough manpower or cryptographer

725
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:08,320
person power to handle all of those or

726
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:11,170
are we losing focus on things and yes I

727
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,730
do see that you would like to have some

728
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,800
advanced things it would be nice to have

729
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,810
a standard on zero knowledge but you

730
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,880
also want other people to to have

731
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,370
reviewed it and where do they come from

732
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:34,450
because they're kinda busy with the

733
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:36,730
other standards well first sometimes yes

734
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,589
for example with quantum there is no

735
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,929
substantial

736
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:41,550
notion of photography but we all

737
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:44,210
understand that it needs to happen ASAP

738
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,440
and it needs to be highly interoperable

739
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:52,949
but even for things that are much faster

740
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:55,260
like your launch proves its while it's

741
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,870
definitely too early to have normally

742
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,340
standards for specific calibrations as

743
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,259
everyone should use there are already

744
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,140
fragments that are very useful to

745
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,320
standardize like interoperability lower

746
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,900
levels of the stack benchmarks

747
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,500
conventions and terminology because they

748
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,810
enable the conversation and even this

749
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,400
conversation is useful for the

750
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,830
practitioners who can already use these

751
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,750
components crucial it's also useful for

752
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,730
the researchers in academia or building

753
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,140
these components because they can talk

754
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,970
to each other more effectively they can

755
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,700
fairly compare things in their

756
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,189
performance using common conventions for

757
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,890
benchmarking and often conversation also

758
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,330
raises new research problems for example

759
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,150
the work that Tron kinetic resented

760
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,460
earlier about you see modeling emerged

761
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,380
from the first Zika personalization

762
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,710
workshop and the need recognized there

763
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:50,550
to better capture these properties so I

764
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:56,120
think we should not overreach and not

765
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:58,560
become rigid and it's too soon or aim to

766
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,960
solve the very difficult problem of

767
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,670
whose scheme is best but we should look

768
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,150
for the places where meaningful impact

769
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,150
can be made

770
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,770
[Music]

771
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:22,569
since in which standardization conflicts

772
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:24,250
with specialization optimization there's

773
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:26,109
certainly conflict there especially with

774
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,970
very rich functionality where for

775
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:30,970
example performance depends drastically

776
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,529
on the application domain they approach

777
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,660
it we taking to the significally

778
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,940
proselytization effort at this point is

779
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,910
the descriptive rather than prescriptive

780
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,050
one we are trying to comprehensively

781
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,598
describe the different approaches and

782
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:46,150
the main trade-offs to help

783
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,369
practitioners place themselves in the

784
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,670
large engineering landscape of possible

785
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:54,910
approaches I assume that this will

786
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:58,210
eventually converge into a smaller

787
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,549
distilled choice of concrete algorithms

788
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,839
and parameter choices okay I think that

789
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,079
we just have a different idea of what

790
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,480
sound is of what cinemas Asian means to

791
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:09,520
me it's like a standardization body says

792
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,530
something worse what you're saying is

793
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,079
the community working on this gets

794
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,420
together and comes up with hey how do we

795
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,010
decide to write these things down and

796
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,190
it's not a selection of an algorithm

797
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:24,809
it's a selection of a presentation way

798
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,280
of a evaluation way and so on that's

799
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:29,650
this is the component that I stressed so

800
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,460
far it certainly goes beyond that for

801
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,930
example in the proof security track that

802
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,720
deals with algorithms and security

803
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,759
definitions there is a ever-evolving

804
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,970
survey of the specific algorithms and

805
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,770
approaches not know just the conventions

806
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,270
used to designate them in the

807
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,480
implementation part there is a detailed

808
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:52,299
discussion of the modules best practices

809
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,299
for implementations and involving

810
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:59,160
taxonomy of existing implementations and

811
00:37:55,299 --> 00:38:02,940
the properties so there's

812
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,620
a lot to do that is just it it is

813
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:11,790
descriptive level and and yet is

814
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:13,799
substantial so one note that I think

815
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,680
address is what Tonya was saying with

816
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,900
respect to the denial of service problem

817
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,480
which I think it's it's a real problem

818
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:26,130
and in the aspect of the of the right

819
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,770
time for standardization I think another

820
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,090
element that we can look at is not

821
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,650
necessarily whether it's the right time

822
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,940
to standardize but whether it's the

823
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,180
right time to have a standardization

824
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,100
process and so then we can what we can

825
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,790
tune is the speed at which the process

826
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,920
goes and so I think if we if we realize

827
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,240
that we have a potential for denial of

828
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,210
service because there's not a lot of

829
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,640
people we can potentially go slower

830
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,730
until we actually I mean whoever's

831
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,129
leading a standardization effort can can

832
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,960
be aware of that and can make sure look

833
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,510
guys we're only going to advance if we

834
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,650
actually have collaboration so at least

835
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:06,270
from the perspective of we I mean the

836
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,900
privacy enhancing cryptography team is

837
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:12,330
having at NIST now with respect let's

838
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,970
say with with your notes proofs is that

839
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:17,700
we're emphasizing this aspect of

840
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:20,100
developing reference material and and

841
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,200
positioning I mean you even put it as a

842
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,150
disclaimer when we made our initial

843
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,339
comments that were not this doesn't mean

844
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,260
an endorsement for standards was really

845
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,360
because we feel that that process is

846
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,250
important so the process of building

847
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,410
reference material is a time during

848
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,840
which we are getting informed we're also

849
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,390
putting our contribution and so I think

850
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,710
that aspect of speed not only of so

851
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,549
basically not looking at a particular

852
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,080
time for standardization to act to have

853
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,210
a standard but a time to have the

854
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,460
standardization process I think that

855
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:53,510
gives us more flexibility to have a more

856
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,510
secure process

857
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,940
right now there is a call for proposals

858
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,099
by DARPA when they see program for

859
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,750
building zero knowledge proof systems

860
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,280
it's going to be funded by many tens of

861
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,560
millions of dollars and consist of

862
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,010
multiple teams constructed into several

863
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,259
tiers and there's ta one which deals

864
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,660
with specific applications for your

865
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,270
knowledge and ta two that deals with

866
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,520
creating the backends that actually runs

867
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,910
to get a busy launch protocols and

868
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,619
here's the thing it will be performers

869
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,810
dozens of researchers funded by DARPA

870
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:33,550
and some will be building these

871
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,440
applications and some will be building

872
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,780
these backends and they need to talk to

873
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,080
each other and some groups most of them

874
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,630
probably will be will only be building

875
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,670
the higher part or the lower part so how

876
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,369
do we make any of these talk to any of

877
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:50,589
those right so this is essential for a

878
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:53,830
project the US government has been

879
00:40:50,589 --> 00:41:00,339
essential for national security then it

880
00:40:53,830 --> 00:41:02,799
requires yes specifically for these and

881
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:04,990
similar applications we're developing

882
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,599
the SDK interface standard as part of

883
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:10,629
the personalization effort that aims to

884
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,839
make to achieve interoperability at the

885
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,490
level of conveying statements to be

886
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,200
proven into your knowledge between the

887
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,990
application layer in the cryptographic

888
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,149
layer so we've seen this kind of

889
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,160
concrete engineering means already it is

890
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:29,470
very early deployment if in research

891
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:31,569
stage so maybe I won't even take it a

892
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,919
bit of a step back when when both of you

893
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,540
were also answering at the beginning of

894
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,550
this class question you were mentioning

895
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,470
a lot of this idea of right as a

896
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,690
responsibility and accountability and

897
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,279
transparency and I think maybe even

898
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:46,060
going back to what Tonya was also saying

899
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,010
before this idea that there is a kind of

900
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:51,520
very little involvement from academia

901
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:53,950
because usually you're traditionally

902
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,599
industry has been driving with standards

903
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,848
or standard bodies have been driving

904
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,190
standards for industry but now we're

905
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,770
kind of seeing and I hope that this is

906
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,530
the case that maybe standards is a way

907
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,490
to bridge academia and Industry right

908
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,470
and this is a way to bring

909
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,118
accountability because there is sort of

910
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,410
in

911
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,640
currently different interests from both

912
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:17,609
both sides so my question I guess is is

913
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,519
twofold one is is standardization the

914
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:23,880
only way to bridge academia and industry

915
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:28,589
and the other question is is more on the

916
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,089
lines of I guess what is what is the

917
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,828
best what is the better way to

918
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:36,319
standardize through standard bodies or

919
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:36,319
through community efforts right so

920
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:53,060
well I think that yeah there many ways

921
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:56,140
different ways of having this community

922
00:42:53,060 --> 00:43:02,810
efforts the industry academia

923
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:08,060
partnerships standards one one way it

924
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:14,060
depends a lot whether the the interests

925
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:20,540
of the academia they happen at the same

926
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:22,970
time when I mentioned the mid-90s when

927
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,430
you know when I was working in the IDF

928
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:28,459
there are very very few cryptographers

929
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,690
involved with that even though things

930
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,339
were very important things were

931
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,140
happening because you know these things

932
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:35,710
would happen at the beginning it's a

933
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:39,290
very hard to hard to change them later

934
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:43,270
but there was no awareness in the

935
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,270
academic community that actually

936
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,640
something is happening in the world and

937
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,380
we are not participating

938
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,569
so definitely standards is one one way

939
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,310
of doing it depends on the type of

940
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:58,790
standards some standards that no

941
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,440
academician will be able to work because

942
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:07,130
they are boring and they are

943
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:13,220
bureaucratic they are closed there are

944
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:15,500
different constellations but right now I

945
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:19,578
mean when these things happen together

946
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,750
is the best now in in the last year's we

947
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:25,160
saw for the development of TLS 1.3 an

948
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,400
amazing

949
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:33,310
joint work of the industry of the

950
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,310
experts and TLS from the industry side

951
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,109
cryptographers and security people and

952
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:46,100
formal methods people having really a

953
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:47,540
huge collaboration and hopefully in the

954
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,180
years to come but the truth is that

955
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:55,120
there is very good track record that

956
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,120
when cryptography is done with

957
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,980
professional cryptographers the result

958
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:06,920
I'm not saying that they will be perfect

959
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:10,700
but they stand time much better yeah so

960
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,180
I won't say that there is one model that

961
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:18,830
always works better than the others but

962
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:22,040
the point is that the weakest link are

963
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,870
they are us the researchers because we

964
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,680
like to work only on what we like to

965
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:29,089
work and if something requires too much

966
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,770
involvement with details of stuff like

967
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:37,850
that then many of us we will not do that

968
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:40,580
so it's really a responsibility we

969
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:44,690
cannot wait for the industry to can say

970
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:46,759
please please help us this is a very

971
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,930
very important point right I mean I

972
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,390
don't want to stop anybody else from

973
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,509
answering the question but how do we

974
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,319
incentivize researchers right

975
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,600
cryptographers to be in these things

976
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:03,650
this is kind of going back to what are

977
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:05,900
they interested was who I was saying

978
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,330
look do you know of anyone know of

979
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:14,210
anybody who made tenure because of their

980
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:16,910
contribution to standards there's just

981
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:20,060
academia the traditional age does not

982
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,779
have the recognition or the resources to

983
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,109
invest

984
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,349
this really really important noble holy

985
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:33,590
work and it's not a work of you know one

986
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:37,470
month it's a lot a lot of investment and

987
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:41,550
it is grudge work and talking to people

988
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:46,770
and things that scientists are not to do

989
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:49,170
in the reason you're now seeing you know

990
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,900
some convergence is because academia is

991
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,810
becoming much much more industry

992
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:58,890
friendly anyway everybody has business

993
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:06,109
incentives so now there is the resources

994
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:09,029
and the incentives advanced you know

995
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:10,710
prominent scientists to participate in

996
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:13,710
this work but my providing your answer

997
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:16,940
is unless you have the business reward

998
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,940
and credits to do that

999
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,300
[Music]

1000
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:49,260
the coppersmith sure but I mean the

1001
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,480
academic systems not the Deming system

1002
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,390
is not set up to reward you for wasting

1003
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,400
your time on standards I don't it money

1004
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,430
to do I don't have time to go it's

1005
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,619
against publications whether so I mean

1006
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,299
I'm doing it because for the good of the

1007
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:08,160
world but I'm a totally it did for doing

1008
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:10,050
it so so I think that when you say and

1009
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,390
talk about working standards and when I

1010
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:17,670
say working standards I think we have a

1011
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:19,259
different different feeling about this I

1012
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:23,060
wrote many papers

1013
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,060
thanks to my involvement

1014
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:31,330
that people were defining things and I

1015
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:35,710
was documenting talking about developing

1016
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:39,509
the Torah fee inventing defining proving

1017
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:42,220
so this is part of our research world

1018
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,980
it's true that you have to spend time

1019
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:47,080
interacting with the engineers

1020
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:52,450
interacting with industry which I

1021
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:54,730
usually find but also a great

1022
00:48:52,450 --> 00:49:02,439
educational experience and a great

1023
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:03,940
source of problems to work I think

1024
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,050
there's one big difference between what

1025
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,440
I'm talking about what you're talking

1026
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:11,440
about you talk about standardizing your

1027
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,260
own algorithms so you're mentioning AES

1028
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,170
mentions r3 so you have an inherent

1029
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,640
motivation to see these things getting

1030
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,650
used and yes then it's totally

1031
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,520
worthwhile to invest a little bit extra

1032
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,080
or a large cut extra to push this into

1033
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:30,280
standardization what is you motivated to

1034
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,860
go for the year or two years Wallace is

1035
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,290
in discussion what I'm talking about is

1036
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,820
that there are a lot of standards which

1037
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,880
are being written which are being pushed

1038
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:42,130
by industry for their own interest and

1039
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,020
they have the same idea hey look we have

1040
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,430
this thing one of our designers did this

1041
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:49,300
we now would like to have a stamp of

1042
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:52,779
approval of you ITF I saw Etsy what have

1043
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,760
you not and spending time on reviewing

1044
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,820
and cleaning up the mess that is there

1045
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,920
that is not very rewarding but it's also

1046
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,140
necessary to do because we see those

1047
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,300
things getting used in products and if

1048
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,120
you were yesterday at work every single

1049
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,950
paper was showing a really fatal flaw in

1050
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,870
real-world deployed things and

1051
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,189
essentially everything was based

1052
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:14,350
understanding where the standard was

1053
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:16,330
just flawed because we as a community

1054
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:19,360
don't have enough time to review all of

1055
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,700
those and I'm not talking about a s or

1056
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,830
sha-3 that was lots of community

1057
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,899
involved I'm talking about all these

1058
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:27,430
other things which fly by and say hey do

1059
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,880
you want to give a comment on this whole

1060
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,879
standard

1061
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,860
heavy weights or processes but also in a

1062
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,049
community driven once where a lot of day

1063
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,090
for it is a bit of like a potluck party

1064
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,430
everybody comes along with their

1065
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,290
thoughts and pet peeves and you need to

1066
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:50,040
somehow call this all of these together

1067
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:53,670
into something coherent and the most

1068
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,350
effective ways to leverage those pet

1069
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:57,000
peeves into you know what if you're so

1070
00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:00,600
pissed about that why don't you write

1071
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,270
that chapter and sometimes work often it

1072
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,370
doesn't often they have the full intent

1073
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,840
to do it but once they fly back and have

1074
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:09,710
their teaching obligations and their

1075
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,930
deadlines in their grant reports then

1076
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,640
the energy dissipates and I think we

1077
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:24,330
still learning the ropes of how to

1078
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:26,730
create just a common standard i I

1079
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:29,759
conceive that the notion of standard

1080
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:33,120
does include the case where people wanna

1081
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,950
standardize their own things just for

1082
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,710
the sake of standardization it becomes a

1083
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:39,689
reference so I think the where the issue

1084
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:42,510
may be is how do people recognize

1085
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,040
standards and which standardization

1086
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,860
bodies with particular missions

1087
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,320
recognize particular standards so this

1088
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:52,590
was actually a question posed in a

1089
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,990
previous presentation where I mean I

1090
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,580
post this question about okay if maybe

1091
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,370
one of the benefits of standardization

1092
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,980
is that it goes under a better peer

1093
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:03,810
review and better specification okay if

1094
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,000
that's the only thing that that standard

1095
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,070
is achieving then if people know that

1096
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:14,490
then it's not a problem it's it's

1097
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:16,890
basically a paper so to a certain extent

1098
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,450
I guess depending on the application

1099
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,190
sometimes what we need are actual meta

1100
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:21,779
standards which are standard saying

1101
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:24,240
these are the approved standards

1102
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:27,150
actually to a certain extent NIST does

1103
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,640
that in in particular settings it says

1104
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:32,630
these are the particular standards that

1105
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:35,220
we accept for signatures etc etcetera

1106
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,360
and that particular vendors need to use

1107
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,279
if they do business with the government

1108
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,360
for example

1109
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,530
so yeah I think I mean I I felt this

1110
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,720
even while I was preparing the

1111
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,900
presentation for this workshop the

1112
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,399
question of what is the standard comes

1113
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,050
back and forth and usually we're talking

1114
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,070
about standards and we have a an

1115
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:59,160
implicit mindset so maybe sometimes it's

1116
00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:03,570
better that with this disambiguate what

1117
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:05,580
we're talking about okay thanks I think

1118
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,980
we're good we spoke a lot about like the

1119
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,930
origins of standards like worried where

1120
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,430
the standards originate how what is the

1121
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,270
best way to proceed with us what are the

1122
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,640
incentives and so on

1123
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,620
now I want to ask like okay now we

1124
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,549
assume that we have some standard for

1125
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:23,009
example there is this tension right we

1126
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:26,580
kind of are all aware maybe maybe

1127
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:30,090
secretly aware that standards can

1128
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,950
somehow stop innovation right so right

1129
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,110
companies can adopt some standard

1130
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:36,000
implemented they put it in their product

1131
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,890
they integrate it and everything's good

1132
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,900
and then you know a few years later

1133
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:43,980
suddenly it's broken or there is a

1134
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,830
better standard right our researchers

1135
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,420
motivated to look into this new this

1136
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,740
direction one now there is a standard

1137
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,170
and you know that maybe it's not gonna

1138
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,359
be adopted what's the tension here how

1139
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:59,160
do we form standards so that we don't

1140
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:04,410
stop innovation right I will talk about

1141
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:07,259
good standards or bad standards well I

1142
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,569
think the the quality of being good or

1143
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,310
bad can actually be it's it's a

1144
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:14,040
contextual property it can change over

1145
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:17,250
time I think I mean I think the answer

1146
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,080
can go both ways so if we develop a good

1147
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,480
standards in a particular good point in

1148
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,490
time that can promote adoption can

1149
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,460
promote innovation can be a good

1150
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:31,770
reference for people to do more research

1151
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:34,440
and innovation along that line now if we

1152
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:39,120
have a context where compliance with the

1153
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:42,090
standard is required and the standard

1154
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,680
becomes obsolete and the standardization

1155
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,750
context is not able to

1156
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:50,629
revised the standard retired we draw the

1157
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,980
standard we'll replace it by some

1158
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:56,780
something else then that's a problem

1159
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:59,840
again I think in a big part that may be

1160
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,220
an issue not with the standard because I

1161
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,780
mean at least in this use case the

1162
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,390
standard may have been good when it was

1163
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,350
designed it may be a problem with the

1164
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:11,000
structure that holds the standard so

1165
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:14,470
let's say that yes I think it's a great

1166
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,830
standard it is it went through a good

1167
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:22,009
process it's holding fine let's say that

1168
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:24,410
next year it's broken can we change it

1169
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:26,180
immediately if we can then we have a

1170
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,520
problem but is it because the standard

1171
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,049
was bad well it was bad now we know it

1172
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,700
but previously it was a good standard

1173
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:33,500
but correct me if I'm wrong you're

1174
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,330
talking about more like the process

1175
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,650
right there on one hand you have the

1176
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:39,380
process on the other hand you have the

1177
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:41,090
adoption part so talking for example TLS

1178
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,460
I think this could be a good example a

1179
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:44,930
new standard was created for a tails 1.3

1180
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,200
but how many companies are how many

1181
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:57,919
right services adopted TRS 1.3 at this

1182
00:55:48,200 --> 00:56:00,460
point that's that's mainly because once

1183
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,460
the browser

1184
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:13,579
very fast so that's relatively first but

1185
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:17,210
standards like TLS I mean this that they

1186
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:22,730
are not a block cipher not basic

1187
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:25,790
primitives but protocols or modes of

1188
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:28,280
operations they should be built in some

1189
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:31,040
flexible world so that at least the

1190
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,829
components of it can be can be replaced

1191
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,440
so that's a very important consideration

1192
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:40,970
to have in mind when you develop a

1193
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:44,630
standard there is a tension between

1194
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:47,240
making flexible and making it too

1195
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:52,630
flexible standards that have too many

1196
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:56,959
options problems of interoperability or

1197
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:58,730
complexity so so you need to find some

1198
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,819
balance but definitely there needs to be

1199
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:03,920
an element of flexibility agility in

1200
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:08,230
which you can change the components

1201
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:13,309
anyway when when standard is finalized

1202
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:15,970
the interests of the designers goes down

1203
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:18,890
but the interests of the Kryptonite

1204
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:32,930
because now you can write the paper I

1205
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:41,450
broke their list 1.3 and so a lot of

1206
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:46,040
standards not just in photography where

1207
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:50,290
the standard sometimes it's just a

1208
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:53,180
de-facto technology standard has some

1209
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:56,450
limitations or constraints and there's a

1210
00:57:53,180 --> 00:58:00,169
whole ecosystem and research field born

1211
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:01,790
just around dealing with the constraints

1212
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,970
that the technology is created and

1213
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,869
overcoming if anything I would be

1214
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:08,890
concerned about

1215
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:19,549
all this energy channel that's breaking

1216
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:24,890
dealing with I hope I hope we can't read

1217
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:26,630
it so maybe maybe a bit more

1218
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:29,118
I don't like technical question but

1219
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:31,789
along these lines of having a standard

1220
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,839
already set in place like the question

1221
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:36,380
is really like we're talking about

1222
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:38,210
advanced cryptographic standards but

1223
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,670
really to be honest all these advanced

1224
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,039
cryptography actually uses use

1225
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:45,130
primitives that are not so advanced

1226
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,329
whatever we define as advanced right and

1227
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,979
what do we do with these standards right

1228
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:50,269
these are common like if I put this

1229
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:51,649
specific example of threshold

1230
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:53,718
cryptography homomorphic encryption is

1231
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,219
your knowledge right at somewhere

1232
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:57,349
another you're using some commitment

1233
00:58:55,219 --> 00:59:00,469
scheme or at point you're gonna be using

1234
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:01,940
some signature maybe not all of these

1235
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:03,799
are standardized are we too early

1236
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,509
standardizing advanced cryptography and

1237
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:07,819
and what do we do about these common

1238
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:12,219
primitive do we all standardize them

1239
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:12,219
individually for different applications

1240
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,960
we human race not we specifically we're

1241
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:28,930
standardizing what we care about but

1242
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,190
there are many simpler primitives that

1243
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:34,549
aren't fully standardized things that

1244
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,059
are much better understood in fact three

1245
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:37,400
years ago

1246
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:41,690
Nigel smart and several of his

1247
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,420
associates wrote a letter to NIST

1248
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:47,210
asking for a more attention to

1249
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:50,029
standardization of cryptographic tools

1250
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,499
that are pretty well understood for

1251
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:53,299
example your knowledge proofs but not

1252
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:55,520
the fancy general ones that we dealing

1253
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:57,830
with now but rather things

1254
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,500
sigmund protocol for discrete log and

1255
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,480
Peterson commitments and the properties

1256
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:06,730
opening this transfer garbage circuits

1257
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:09,290
pushing it and these are things that

1258
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:11,470
especially the first few have converted

1259
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:14,060
nicely they are building blocks in many

1260
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:15,379
existing protocols in industry as well

1261
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,600
as the protocols that we are dealing

1262
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:23,960
with here and it would have been nice to

1263
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:28,160
have those covered by the way with the

1264
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,880
with the soon to be approval of EDSA

1265
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:36,049
essentially contains the KP of the

1266
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:39,800
spirit board embedded in it just just

1267
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:42,050
one shot so I think as we move further

1268
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,240
into the future and assuming that we

1269
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,800
will be standardizing more generic SMP

1270
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,459
see I think there will be a point indeed

1271
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:54,730
where it will make sense to have a good

1272
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:57,380
reference definition slash reference

1273
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:01,010
some something that we can reference if

1274
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:02,660
not an actual standard of some things

1275
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:06,200
like maybe garbled circuits oblivious

1276
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:08,149
transfer some commitment schemes but

1277
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,399
going immediately to those without

1278
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:13,940
knowing what is it that we're going to

1279
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,820
want to do with them might not be the

1280
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,770
best option if there's a possibility

1281
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,360
that when actually we go for the more

1282
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:22,490
advanced things then we actually need a

1283
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,370
little tweak of the commitment scheme

1284
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:28,490
now having said this I actually think

1285
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:30,730
that special cryptography is in a kind

1286
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:33,740
of a sweet spot in the following sense

1287
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,710
it does require let's say for the

1288
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:39,080
multi-party setting it does require

1289
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:41,330
exercising some SNP see in certain cases

1290
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:43,250
but the actual scope of threshold

1291
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,080
cryptography I mean if you look at it

1292
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,820
from the point of view of threshold

1293
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,620
schemes for approved cryptographic

1294
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,710
primitives it actually has a very

1295
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:54,890
well-defined scope so even though we

1296
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:56,420
might be looking at maybe we can call it

1297
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,180
a large number of possible

1298
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,280
standardization elements it still it it

1299
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,040
it comes down from a small number of

1300
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,589
primitives let's say we may want to do

1301
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:11,320
threshold RS a threshold ECDSA

1302
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:11,320
threshold at the SAS reference condom

1303
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:16,099
although the post quantum is still in

1304
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,140
the evaluations it may take a little bit

1305
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:20,660
more time the point I wanted to make is

1306
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,790
the following if we say that what we

1307
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:28,790
want let's say in the next one or two

1308
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:31,400
years is a threshold version of ECDSA or

1309
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:32,900
RSA key gen and we know that we're going

1310
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,109
to have to use let's say an oblivious

1311
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:38,060
transfer there then we're talking about

1312
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:40,520
one standard that is gonna use one

1313
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:43,369
primitive so maybe the actual exercise

1314
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,560
of doing the full standardization is

1315
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:48,500
what we need to actually be fine within

1316
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,990
their own standard one implementation of

1317
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,640
one let's say oblivious transfer and I

1318
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:54,618
think that's a good exercise without

1319
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,930
having to commit that we've standardized

1320
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:58,790
oblivious transfer because now when we

1321
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,770
go for the next maybe more advanced SN

1322
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:02,930
PC protocol that also requires double

1323
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:05,180
use transfer then we can analyze okay

1324
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:07,220
can we use the one that we already used

1325
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,950
and then if you can we can just refer to

1326
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:12,200
it we can even if we want at that point

1327
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:14,450
actually remove it to a standalone

1328
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,009
document but then we also retained the

1329
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:18,529
possibility of saying you know what for

1330
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:20,030
this primitive it was a good exercise to

1331
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,950
have done that oblivious transfer but

1332
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,660
now we want a slightly tweaked version

1333
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:27,799
so I guess the summary of what I'm

1334
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:29,509
saying is while we have a small scope

1335
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:33,470
where we're just going for one or two

1336
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:35,720
advanced concrete protocols I don't see

1337
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,669
it as a big deal to actually embed in

1338
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,828
the standard the primitives that we're

1339
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,839
using and then when we start defining

1340
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:45,800
three four or five advanced protocols

1341
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:48,069
then we can we can by then we have

1342
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,400
learned with the experience

1343
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:56,869
one fourth Thanks

1344
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,099
so I want to kind of ask a question but

1345
01:03:56,869 --> 01:04:00,740
I think it's a very interesting one

1346
01:03:58,099 --> 01:04:03,589
we're going back to the tension between

1347
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,810
academia and industry and interest in

1348
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:08,450
the industry we have kind of a legal

1349
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:10,339
framework for processes and for

1350
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:12,560
applications and things they're already

1351
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:14,779
established right almost trust models

1352
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,578
but also like a legal punishment it for

1353
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:19,460
behavior for malicious behavior let's

1354
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:21,680
call it right so can we justify

1355
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:25,280
the effort from from let's say our

1356
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,879
ciphers researches to write ensure or

1357
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,260
enforce non-malicious active behavior in

1358
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,030
these cryptographic protocols when we

1359
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,710
know that whenever there is gonna be a

1360
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:36,230
cheater there's gonna be a kind of a

1361
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:38,420
breach of contract and legal consequence

1362
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,590
right and and and attached to this

1363
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:44,060
question is kind of the idea

1364
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:47,980
SOCAN standards kind of help to define

1365
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,980
regulatory and legal frameworks

1366
01:04:53,080 --> 01:05:01,540
so in some sense cryptography can

1367
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,540
enforce behavior or can catch behavior

1368
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:19,310
exactly and that's right so we have

1369
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:21,560
scenarios where people are not

1370
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:24,220
associated with robust identities and

1371
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:27,799
are not accountable in the standard

1372
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:30,970
world of legal enforcement and maybe the

1373
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:33,770
clearest one is blockchain right you are

1374
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:37,540
respecting transactions that were posted

1375
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:41,270
by unknown people and the only way to

1376
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:42,800
make this work is by not assuming that

1377
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,630
there is any recourse other than a

1378
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,930
cryptographic one to ensuring the

1379
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:51,890
correct behavior there are other

1380
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:55,040
scenarios where there might be fall back

1381
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:57,799
alternatives using society's legacy ways

1382
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:00,830
of enforcing correct behavior but those

1383
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:03,170
are very expensive it's true that

1384
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:04,630
humanity has spent in the last few maybe

1385
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:07,220
tens of thousands of years building

1386
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:11,599
civilization aka a way to enforce norms

1387
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:17,180
but it has many costs it has

1388
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:19,099
in Liberty in resources in performance

1389
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,609
of these systems and to the extent that

1390
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:25,009
we can replace norms enforced the Google

1391
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:27,319
way with real-time cryptographic

1392
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:29,569
protocols often there is a benefit to

1393
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:33,140
that and it's these places that I think

1394
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:35,150
are being monetized by many of the names

1395
01:06:33,140 --> 01:07:06,430
you'll see on the sponsor list of this

1396
01:06:35,150 --> 01:07:06,430
workshop to understand so dealing with

1397
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:33,618
regulations right it's it's a big deal

1398
01:07:31,069 --> 01:07:37,430
and we have to work in that direction

1399
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:40,209
even if it works very slowly it's a very

1400
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,209
important aspect

1401
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:48,890
Peter Van Valkenburg

1402
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:52,220
talked yesterday morning about basic

1403
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:56,480
constitutional rights of modern society

1404
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:58,250
is she committed a crime you will not

1405
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,350
get punishment so I think there's a very

1406
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,930
dangerous slippery slope in automated

1407
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:05,380
punishment systems and concerta social

1408
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:05,379
rating

1409
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:14,600
yeah I I think I do have some concern

1410
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,729
with the premise of of the question

1411
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,970
which is well assuming that we can catch

1412
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:23,059
people and I mean even if you even if we

1413
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:25,670
catch people misbehaving that does not

1414
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:30,200
necessarily mean that we can enforce

1415
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:32,290
some some punishment and and I guess a

1416
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,790
full answer to the question would also

1417
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:36,830
have to be parameterised with what is

1418
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:39,439
the cost of being caught versus the cost

1419
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,818
of actually achieving whatever we were

1420
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,919
trying to get with the malicious

1421
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:50,380
behavior but one next two extra thoughts

1422
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:53,109
one is one potential problem of

1423
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:56,420
standardizing let's say semi honest

1424
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:58,400
secure passively secure protocols that

1425
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:02,149
completely break down in an active in a

1426
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:04,670
with an active adversary is is the

1427
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:07,009
problem of misuse so now you have a

1428
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:10,399
protocol that is stamped this has been

1429
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:12,859
zero knowledge proof for SNP C in the

1430
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,420
semi honest case and then for the people

1431
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:16,670
are not cryptography so we're using a

1432
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:18,589
secure system therefore we can just do

1433
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:20,450
whatever you want right so it's the it's

1434
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:23,899
the problem of the false sense of

1435
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:26,500
security and I think the I mean in

1436
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:28,969
general the problem of misuse of

1437
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,729
protocols of devices and all that it's

1438
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:34,940
it's a huge problem in in cryptography

1439
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:38,779
so I would tend to say if we can do

1440
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:40,759
maliciously secure actively secure or

1441
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:42,740
secure against malicious adversaries

1442
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:46,339
then I think we should go for it at

1443
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:48,469
least in the SMBC arena the there has

1444
01:09:46,339 --> 01:09:50,899
been a convergence with respect to the

1445
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:53,359
costs previously it was like 40 let's

1446
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:55,639
say 40 times difference and then you

1447
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,240
know a lot of settings those the factor

1448
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:02,090
of difference has decreased a lot just a

1449
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:05,540
final note is that at least in the SMP C

1450
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:07,790
area we we actually have I mean a good

1451
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:09,140
characterization between semi honest

1452
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,870
malicious and then we have the covert

1453
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:15,100
adversaries or the covert adversary

1454
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:18,090
model where which exactly

1455
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,990
exactly measures the case we're

1456
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,640
adversaries behave based on the

1457
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:28,360
probability that they can they can be

1458
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:33,220
caught and so fundamentally creating

1459
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:35,230
very very serious if you give a false

1460
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:37,480
sense of security because we are experts

1461
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:39,129
and probably what we created is secure

1462
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,740
the responsibility and the

1463
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:52,150
accountability is on us so we should aim

1464
01:10:41,740 --> 01:11:07,059
for the but we're just one extra

1465
01:10:52,150 --> 01:11:10,179
technicality in this I mean it's one one

1466
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:11,890
technical aspect where it's kind of it

1467
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:14,290
would be an analogous question to which

1468
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:17,710
I have more education in answering is

1469
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:20,560
the case of adaptive adversaries versus

1470
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,090
static adversaries where in secure

1471
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,420
multi-party computation at least there's

1472
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:28,330
a lot of cases where we we can do the

1473
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:29,710
proof for static adversaries we can't we

1474
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:32,380
don't have the protocol for adaptive

1475
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:34,090
adversaries but at the same time we

1476
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:36,970
don't know of a real practical attack

1477
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:38,500
that would break down the system and so

1478
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:41,800
in those cases it's a little harder to

1479
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,290
say and so I guess what I want to say is

1480
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:49,120
I would be inclined to accept a static

1481
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:53,260
malicious so a protocol securing a

1482
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:56,019
static malicious model if I don't know

1483
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,910
of any practical attack in an adaptive

1484
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,650
scenario and I don't know any protocol

1485
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:02,620
that is efficient at least in an

1486
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:04,780
adaptive scenario where is for the semi

1487
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:06,250
honest versus malicious case it's a much

1488
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,730
easier answer like go for the

1489
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,730
maliciously

1490
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:13,550
because we know how to do that right and

1491
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:14,960
it also boils down to what Aaron was

1492
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:17,960
saying before that we need a lot of user

1493
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,489
guidance that it's actually less

1494
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,800
important to have like the concrete

1495
01:12:19,489 --> 01:12:23,598
scheme but it's important to see to say

1496
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:27,940
on the annotations what does is achieve

1497
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:27,940
what we expect and what can you expect

1498
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:53,599
I mean we have more questions but

1499
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,848
there's basically like 15 20 minutes

1500
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:59,179
left and I want to open it for for Q&A

1501
01:12:55,849 --> 01:13:01,130
so if you have any questions you want to

1502
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:10,610
come to one of the microphones and ask

1503
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:14,150
anything you're interested in here to

1504
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:20,049
ask which is about for more metal

1505
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:22,400
missiles and how do you think this

1506
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:27,159
technology may be used in the

1507
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:32,089
photography or standard weather is it

1508
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:38,150
like usable right now or a sterilization

1509
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:39,230
main processes or is it does it needs to

1510
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:45,679
be improved

1511
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:47,959
right so Hoover already mentioned the

1512
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,329
role that follow methods played in the

1513
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:53,179
definition of chile's 1.3 I think that's

1514
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:55,880
a great achievement at the same time

1515
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:58,579
what is the rather lame end user I would

1516
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,170
like to see is that I can actually use

1517
01:13:58,579 --> 01:14:04,549
this on things that I'm kind of

1518
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:06,860
prototyping or something and so yes I

1519
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:10,219
think more has to happen has to be

1520
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:13,489
easier for me to tries but yes please be

1521
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:16,940
involved and you saw that the previous

1522
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:19,919
talk was easier being used on anok on

1523
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:21,809
the case I think this is helpful and

1524
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,510
if they are candidate solutions it would

1525
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:27,180
be nice to get them formally verified or

1526
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:29,810
shown to be not verifiable which case

1527
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,810
they should be fixed

1528
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,860
analysis of traffic corridors are

1529
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:42,570
improved amazingly in the last year's I

1530
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:48,269
don't think that there is any excuse to

1531
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:54,809
have something a standard or unimportant

1532
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:59,660
component there is no excuse not to to

1533
01:14:54,810 --> 01:15:02,040
be analyzed through these tools you know

1534
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:06,080
I'm not sure about the completeness of

1535
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:08,970
these tools but they are great debuggers

1536
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,370
1.3 is an excellent example where people

1537
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:14,100
have been working in running these tools

1538
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:17,250
you know they found problems they found

1539
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:31,140
issues they give you guidance on the

1540
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:37,260
design so problem with a bootstrapping

1541
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:42,540
problem you know I mean really I think

1542
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:47,160
that we should be analyzing stuff as

1543
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:53,840
much as we can we're using the which

1544
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:55,950
will keep improving thank you

1545
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,390
thank you very much for this discussion

1546
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:59,639
I found it really interesting and I

1547
01:15:57,390 --> 01:16:01,530
appreciated the balance of say like the

1548
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,240
positives of standards efforts and some

1549
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:05,550
of the things to be concerned with I

1550
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:32,099
guess I have to interrupt you and say

1551
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:41,970
that your talk really well just wait

1552
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:44,580
till what I was I have big big questions

1553
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:45,810
kind of about how to you know know like

1554
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,670
what are the things to watch out for

1555
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,800
like what would it mean for a standard

1556
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,450
to be bad or to go wrong that there

1557
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,100
might be pitfalls to learn from it but I

1558
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:54,960
wanted to phrase it as a more maybe

1559
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,520
hopefully interesting question like do

1560
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,830
you have any horror stories or like

1561
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,870
anecdotes of standards gone wrong maybe

1562
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:03,809
like the second worst standard to the

1563
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:05,490
dual EC one that we might learn from as

1564
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:09,960
a counterexample every single talk

1565
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:12,950
yesterday at work wreck the workshop

1566
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,090
yesterday workshop on attacks in crypto

1567
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:17,849
essentially everything was standardised

1568
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:21,900
and broken so there was Bluetooth there

1569
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:26,040
was WPA three very new standard and also

1570
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:28,620
broken so these are the last two talks

1571
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:31,350
at my head everything before that as

1572
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:34,740
well what is there to learn from those

1573
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:38,220
though like is there so some of those I

1574
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:40,050
would say are closed community no

1575
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,090
feedback from the outside kind of

1576
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:46,680
standards and I think this is kind of a

1577
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:48,360
warning flag for me by now it would be

1578
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,920
much more surprising to me if something

1579
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:52,710
which had gotten a lot of community

1580
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,150
feedback and review I mean like for

1581
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:56,580
instance you mentioned follow methods if

1582
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:58,889
there has been pieces now with just 1.3

1583
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:01,880
with all the praise it's still not in

1584
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:04,410
one model as deep everything together so

1585
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,550
there still are some little cracks where

1586
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,880
things could go wrong but I would be

1587
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:09,100
much more surprise for things

1588
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,949
that going wrong then was something

1589
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,530
which was cobbled together because

1590
01:18:11,949 --> 01:18:36,940
somebody needed something and nobody

1591
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:39,190
ever looked at it and capstone including

1592
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:41,138
chip manufacturing was broken within

1593
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:43,080
less than I don't know 60 days Matt

1594
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:44,949
glaze among other people at ATT loves

1595
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:47,050
showed how to break that but basically

1596
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:51,309
this was supposed to be the only way you

1597
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:54,310
encrypt audio turn you know audio signal

1598
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:56,290
transmission by a government standard

1599
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:58,929
and luckily cryptography record analysts

1600
01:18:56,290 --> 01:19:01,750
in this case broke it so we kind of died

1601
01:18:58,929 --> 01:19:05,080
a peaceful inside' and death that was a

1602
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:08,800
horror I think another cesspool of

1603
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:12,070
horrible standards is blockchain what we

1604
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:15,130
have is many block change projects out

1605
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:17,650
there who are building what are de facto

1606
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:19,780
standards because they are actually

1607
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:22,360
executed interoperable Network

1608
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:24,159
consisting of many thousands of nodes so

1609
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,110
they may not use the S word but that's

1610
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,820
what they're building and somehow they

1611
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:31,299
think it's fine to do so without even

1612
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:33,309
having a specification for the protocol

1613
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,739
let alone any form of analysis or review

1614
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:39,300
process and because it's ternary rather

1615
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:39,299
than binary then it must be fine

1616
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:59,860
for example there is one thing that we

1617
01:19:52,630 --> 01:20:01,390
need to stomp out is this the comfort

1618
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,740
that those fractions of the

1619
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:06,430
cryptographic community broadly

1620
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:09,610
construed have with just putting random

1621
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:11,290
Beach operations together or some field

1622
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:14,380
elements and propellants because they

1623
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:15,850
cannot type match of you can typecast

1624
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,430
them and then they type match and

1625
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:20,320
calling this a cryptographic protocol

1626
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:21,700
that people are actually entrusting with

1627
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,799
many millions perhaps billions of

1628
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:26,170
dollars this is the elephant in the room

1629
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:30,330
right some of these people are probably

1630
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:33,010
fine but many of our colleagues

1631
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:34,720
colleagues those who would have been our

1632
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:37,870
colleagues are actually out there right

1633
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:40,840
now doing very evil stuff I think

1634
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:44,200
knowingly or by incompetence

1635
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:46,710
I mean do you think militias together

1636
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,710
with the best

1637
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:31,180
well if you're so why don't you write

1638
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:32,800
that chapter okay so since you asked the

1639
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:35,020
question like how can you recognize a

1640
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,270
bad standard what does it smell like so

1641
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:40,330
find some standardization body where the

1642
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:44,290
membership fees are high the excess fees

1643
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:46,750
are high and the they charge for

1644
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:49,720
attending meetings right if you take all

1645
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:50,560
three of those fairly lightly not gotten

1646
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,120
any review

1647
01:21:50,560 --> 01:22:02,620
and they randomly pick people from

1648
01:21:52,120 --> 01:22:06,220
different countries yeah this I wanted

1649
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:08,080
to you use the term bad or good I would

1650
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:11,350
like you to look at standards as

1651
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:14,230
something living with a lifecycle as any

1652
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:17,410
asset the enterprise has got a lifecycle

1653
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:21,009
and one thing that I would recommend in

1654
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:23,740
any of the work is put a version it's

1655
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:27,880
you consider it as a block or an asset

1656
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:31,450
of cryptographic thinking on board all

1657
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,440
over the world put it aversion to it and

1658
01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:36,000
look at it

1659
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:39,040
my experience is 25 years of running a

1660
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:45,330
pro services I don't build them I use

1661
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:45,330
them and I have to replace I said one

1662
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:57,070
with three and that's what I do guys try

1663
01:22:53,050 --> 01:23:08,110
to think of it as is yes you have a very

1664
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:10,469
good tool as a version and but twenty

1665
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:14,349
years I'll have to replace it I'm sorry

1666
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:18,130
so please look at it as something that

1667
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:41,710
is a living architecture that we have to

1668
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:47,790
maintain in some way the fact that

1669
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:47,790
things like knowledge not much - maybe

1670
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:58,500
and advantage because you're less likely

1671
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:58,500
to you know to put something very hard

1672
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:10,239
it already already has a version 0.1 is

1673
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,820
also proving useful for the research

1674
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:15,849
that we lead to the consolidation of the

1675
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:18,009
standard for example it allows us to

1676
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:21,489
plug and play with different approaches

1677
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:24,520
to schemes and compare them in terms of

1678
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:26,259
performance because it was built in the

1679
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,570
first place to allow you to change the

1680
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:30,550
backend in a very convenient way even if

1681
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:32,559
you use a different representation that

1682
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:34,630
is the ideal that we striving for it

1683
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,900
adds a que interface makes some headway

1684
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:41,380
towards so to the extent that standards

1685
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:43,719
are intended to foster this competition

1686
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:47,350
and collaboration and putting the DA 1

1687
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:55,600
minute here that plays very well also

1688
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:59,080
with the fluidity thank you

1689
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,420
so before before kind of wrapping it up

1690
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,489
completely I just wanted to kind of say

1691
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:05,560
a couple of conclusions that I got from

1692
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:08,169
this and thank you all for sharing your

1693
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,179
experience and your views it seems like

1694
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:13,360
you know cryptography is still at a very

1695
01:25:10,179 --> 01:25:16,719
early stage right like we really started

1696
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,969
you know 50 years ago right 60 years ago

1697
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,250
or something with computers and advanced

1698
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:23,949
in some sense and now we're at a point

1699
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:25,510
where we see that really academics are

1700
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:26,860
getting more involved with industry

1701
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:28,600
whether it's because the industry is

1702
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:30,009
asking for it or because there is more

1703
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,940
incentives in the industry than there is

1704
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:35,489
in academia right and hopefully now

1705
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:38,049
we're gonna see this trend where

1706
01:25:35,489 --> 01:25:40,330
adoption is done in the right way right

1707
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:42,820
like if you think about how like I don't

1708
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:44,710
know physics and engineering right came

1709
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:46,509
up to be and and how it transfer

1710
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:49,810
knowledge transferred from academia to

1711
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:52,179
the industry right people wouldn't have

1712
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:54,730
thought to put people into a rocket and

1713
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:57,219
shoot him outer space if it wasn't with

1714
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:59,440
the proper set of physicists and

1715
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:01,000
validation of techniques right

1716
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:03,910
this is kind of the analogy that we need

1717
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,310
to get that we wouldn't deploy secure

1718
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:08,740
systems where billions of dollars are

1719
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:11,890
based on without the correct processes

1720
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:14,290
and correct very validations so in this

1721
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:16,150
sense I guess either we need to change

1722
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:18,040
the incentives that exist in academia or

1723
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:21,549
we need to make sure that you the

1724
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:25,570
industry can counter that by by asking

1725
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:27,550
and providing those incentives right so

1726
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,900
in general I would just say if if you're

1727
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:30,310
in the industry and you're building

1728
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:32,710
something then make sure you involve

1729
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:34,180
academics and if you're in the academia

1730
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,800
and you want to stand up standardize

1731
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:38,200
something because you think it's useful

1732
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:42,550
make sure it's useful before right it

1733
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:47,170
kind of goes both ways if there is any

1734
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:49,030
more questions otherwise any more

1735
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:50,980
comments on your end maybe some

1736
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:55,719
conclusion remarks that you also want to

1737
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:56,559
share so maybe let's thank the speakers

1738
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:01,819
and the panelists

1739
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,819
[Applause]
