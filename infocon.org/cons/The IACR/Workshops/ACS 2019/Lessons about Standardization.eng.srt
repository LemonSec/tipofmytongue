1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,160
so mine so I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,649
standardization from from the point of

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,990
view of someone who actually goes and

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,529
implements and verifies and does all

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,539
that stuff so I'm set

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,369
I'm a cryptographer and I decided to

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,010
join the dark side I decided to go into

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,448
private industry and I work at unbound

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,760
tech so what does unbound tech do so we

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,489
our goal is to prevent keys from being

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,180
stolen and we want to prevent keys from

12
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,040
being misused if you're an adversary you

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,110
don't need to steal the key to do what

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,780
you want if you want to sign malware you

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,030
just need to be able to use the key once

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,070
if you want to steal millions of

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,220
bitcoins you only need to sign one

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,739
transaction so for us it's important to

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,780
protect the keys so how do we protect

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,769
the keys so now we have a very short

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,570
video explaining how we protect the keys

22
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:06,119
blend into multiple random shares placed

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,830
on different machines these shares never

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,850
get United

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,060
they're in use so I have to thank the

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:19,619
marketing department for this but this

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,810
is essentially what we do so what's the

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,670
talk going to be about well it's going

29
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,440
to be about one of the things we're

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,090
going to talk about is well we're

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,120
cryptographers we want to imagine the

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,660
worst case but in this case I think of

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,600
and from experience of my grandfather I

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,500
will explain what can go wrong from

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,289
standardization and we're going to talk

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,140
about lessons we can learn from civil

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,270
engineering and then I'm going to say

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,210
well what good can they do and I'm gonna

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,899
give example of ot and ot I'm gonna

40
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,720
focus on ot extension to say well

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:58,350
standardization really is important and

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,820
why it's important and then I'm gonna

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,640
talk about how we can make

44
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,710
standardization nicer in terms of

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,820
descriptiveness how we can make it very

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,989
easy to verify and implement and verify

47
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,600
the standard is met so ok civil

48
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,700
engineering is about designing buildings

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,609
that are robust that won't collapse

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,040
because something you know some strong

51
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,019
wind happened and cryptographers design

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,340
protocols that are robust so it's very

53
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,019
similar idea and it's very easy to learn

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,700
from other people's mistakes because

55
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,680
it's free they've made the mistakes and

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,589
we don't have to suffer so if you can

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,269
avoid mistakes that they've made and we

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,250
can take lessons from what happened to

59
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:45,180
them then we can use those experiences

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,600
for our game so this is I'm presenting

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,510
you dr. Kunal so he was an Indian civil

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,329
engineer on the CN tower and the

63
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,720
pyramids roof so - I think really cool

64
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,850
structures and he's a civil engineer

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,590
he's been a partner as this firm longer

66
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,750
than I've existed he's an insurance

67
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,580
investigator so he's somebody that you

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,370
know when there's an accident sometimes

69
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,860
he goes and actually explains what

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,110
happens and gives detailed reports so

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,800
he's an expert and he's also been on

72
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,660
committees for Standardization and he's

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,880
also he's my grandfather so I get to

74
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,670
hear stories and his his knowledge about

75
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,030
what he

76
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,069
and what what happens in standardization

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,750
why it's been a negative influence on

78
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,239
his field and I'm gonna describe to you

79
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,680
those things so his view on

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,140
standardization so I'll tell you

81
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,270
actually in terms of when I sent in a me

82
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,950
email I said I went to the NIST workshop

83
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,020
which was really nice

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,269
standardization I really enjoyed and I

85
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,640
say I went to I was part of the panel

86
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,450
and then he sends me back this response

87
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,700
well don't go too fast don't go too far

88
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,238
because in my field has reached the

89
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,010
point where it hinders new design

90
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,870
developments and innovation and we

91
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,370
definitely do not want that to happen

92
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,410
and so in his opinion he has a couple of

93
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,570
things that why it's wrong well because

94
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,390
one of the things that became to come

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,549
completely complicated and cumbersome

96
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,589
the standards became too big before what

97
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,530
was a couple of books became an entire

98
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,660
library of standards so you you want to

99
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,830
keep you know your standards and checks

100
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,510
to know what you really want and and one

101
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,520
of the problems is that if you're always

102
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,530
you know focusing on trying to meet the

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,320
standards well you might not have a good

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,960
view of the overall problem you might

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,219
focus on too much on trying to fulfill

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,049
the standards so so I'm gonna discuss

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,520
problems in solution so one of the

108
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,229
things is that standards can be

109
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,109
completed they can be very complicated

110
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,500
so as somebody as the previous speaker

111
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,880
said well we should have full fledged

112
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,610
implementation why because if you have

113
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,340
to fulfil it fully if you have to

114
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,169
implement your full standard you're

115
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,969
gonna realize at some point something is

116
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,669
way too complicated so I have to read

117
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,740
it'll allow you to reduce the complexity

118
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,570
of the standard and of course test

119
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,520
vectors is very helpful because you know

120
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:15,550
if you've done it correctly then there's

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,700
a problem that you know you it can

122
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,650
hinder new designs if I standard I to

123
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,050
primitive and then somebody comes up

124
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,299
with a new algorithm or you come up with

125
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,360
a new algorithm that improves that well

126
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,250
if they won't certify it because you're

127
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,650
using a new algorithm even though you

128
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,760
provide a proof you provide formal

129
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,638
description well that's gonna be

130
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,560
counter to why it would it would be a

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,600
negatives for Standardization

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,850
and so it's better if we stand we do we

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,220
mix bill standards in a modular way so

134
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,900
that sometimes when there's pieces that

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,030
you know you can really improve that

136
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,280
you're not stuck using those old

137
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,869
primitives or the old constructions and

138
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,460
there's another problem that in the

139
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,740
field of civil engineering when they

140
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,330
have standards body or they meet for to

141
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,010
create standards often there's

142
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,070
professors there who want to include

143
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,900
their work in the standards and then but

144
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:16,560
they've never built a building in their

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,479
life and this is ver can be very you

146
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,850
know if if I've never built a building

147
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,169
in my life then and I want to add

148
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,150
something the center it might be

149
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,710
counterproductive to people who actually

150
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,560
build buildings because you don't have

151
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,239
this experience so I would recommend for

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,979
this people that are gonna build

153
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
standards if they have the chance that

154
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:38,070
they should do internships at private

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,049
company to see how you know these

156
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,719
protocols are actually implemented in

157
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,849
their product and an excellent time to

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,740
do this would be for example when

159
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,190
there's a government shutdown because

160
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,120
then they're free to do something else

161
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,919
so so then the next question is how can

162
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,110
standardization help so I'm going to

163
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,930
talk about OT notes the extension so

164
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,430
oblivious transfer is one of the most

165
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,919
important primitives in secure

166
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,280
computation there is so many protocols

167
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,830
that build upon this primitive and ot

168
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,989
extension is a way of getting each

169
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,120
individual oblivious transfer very

170
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,699
cheaply oblivious transfer is a

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,830
primitive where the sender get a sense

172
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,470
to messages the receiver gets learned

173
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,359
one of the two the receiver gets no

174
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,210
information about the other message and

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,560
the sender does not learn which message

176
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,948
the receiver chose so how would you

177
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,479
implement ot extension as somebody who's

178
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:38,220
wants to implement it currently how are

179
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
you going to implement it well the first

180
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,550
step is you're going to go to Google

181
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,770
Scholar and you're going to type in ot

182
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,140
extension you're going to look at all

183
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,609
the relevant papers you're going to look

184
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,889
in a few links

185
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,629
and then you're gonna see okay which one

186
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,310
is the best and then you're gonna check

187
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,740
okay this one looks like the best well

188
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,259
okay but is it from a reputable

189
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,120
conference so let's see so the second

190
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,330
one is the one big candidate

191
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,509
let's see if if from a good conference

192
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:10,409
so it's from crypto 2015 I'm pretty sure

193
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:13,469
you think that's a good conference so

194
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:15,930
you you feel comfortable going okay I've

195
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:18,389
done all these steps I've gone to do ot

196
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,509
extension it's a really good conference

197
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:25,199
and then you go okay everything's rosy

198
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,389
and I can just implement that well yeah

199
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,029
you know when things can go wrong they

200
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,800
can go wrong sometimes and in this case

201
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:34,439
there's two papers that recently came

202
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,070
out that both show that most ot

203
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,930
extension protocols are insecure it's a

204
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,700
bit more technical than that that

205
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,679
there's ways to instantiate these

206
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,360
protocols that are secure and ways to

207
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,920
instantiate these protocols that are not

208
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,279
secure but it's still a major issue and

209
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,410
yeah and then the one lesson you can

210
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,510
learn is that you know these papers in

211
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,209
these conferences can even be wrong

212
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,670
sometimes and standardizing can help

213
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:06,899
ensure that our protocols are more

214
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,880
secure than just trying to use the you

215
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,420
know conference peer-review system which

216
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,939
is has a lot of pressure and then

217
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,740
there's you know extensions of that work

218
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,170
there's like correlated ot it's a

219
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,360
variant of ot where you know instead of

220
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,000
getting one of two message chosen by

221
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,670
this descender first of all there's some

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,850
fixed value that is selected and then

223
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,819
there's each time you do a transfer and

224
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,399
oblivious transfer well there's a

225
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,010
message that is given to the sender and

226
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,019
then the receiver either receives the

227
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,050
message or the message XOR this

228
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,829
correlation core this value this Delta

229
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,839
value we call it and so so there's this

230
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,839
is also a very useful primitive for like

231
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,579
gardling and then well if you look at

232
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
the best protocol currently there is

233
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,359
there's not a formal description of the

234
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,370
protocol and there's not a formal proof

235
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,930
so it's very

236
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,600
during the previous thing that there was

237
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,579
issues and then you have this protocol

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,350
that doesn't have a proof or a formal

239
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,720
description this is very dangerous

240
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,940
territory and standardizing this and

241
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,020
making sure that these primitives are

242
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,820
secure and a good building block will go

243
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,819
a long way to making sure that we have

244
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:26,550
that when we have protocols that they're

245
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:29,279
going to be secure so so how can

246
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,529
standardization help we can have good

247
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,570
places to know we we just look at the

248
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,860
standard and then we're happy we don't

249
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,570
have to verify the rest of the

250
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,610
literature and I want to emphasize that

251
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,950
there's many protocols in the literature

252
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,480
that are just wrong and then when you

253
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,400
read the paper you'll be happy it's

254
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,730
gonna be efficient and you have to read

255
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,130
like many papers to see that it's wrong

256
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,860
like for the example the OT extensions

257
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:56,100
paper that are not that showed that the

258
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,920
original one has issues you have to go

259
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,839
through seven pages of papers on Google

260
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,490
Scholar before you see this paper and

261
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,870
then you have to read each paper very

262
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,600
carefully so it's very time-consuming

263
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:12,000
for you know an implementer might which

264
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,920
might not have much time so one thing

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,900
that would be good is to standardize OTN

266
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,589
ot extension that would be a great favor

267
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,000
to the community I think so now the

268
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:26,790
question is how to improve standards and

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,089
so papers are good but there's something

270
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,829
about writing papers that's aimed for

271
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:35,040
academia and that doesn't make it

272
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,620
necessarily very easy to implement so

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,219
MPs in general is just challenging to

274
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,900
implement for even for experts and so

275
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,250
how do we make papers easier to

276
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,350
implement and understand okay so first

277
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,270
of all we'll start with what we know has

278
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,610
been done that's really good protocol

279
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,529
decomposition is wonderful I can say oh

280
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,330
just use oblivious transfer here I don't

281
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,779
care what oblivious transfer you are

282
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,700
using I this makes it so much easier

283
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,029
because I can choose the implementation

284
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,029
I want

285
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,690
okay but to see why papers aren't

286
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,670
necessarily maybe not written the best

287
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,300
way for implementation we have to look

288
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,790
at a historical perspective so this so

289
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,010
excluding the participant of TPM PC 2019

290
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,980
who know the answer does anyone know

291
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:32,270
what the sequence is I'll give you a

292
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:34,180
clue it's related to crypto come on you

293
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,699
seem to know what it is

294
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:44,030
something about submissions okay

295
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,280
somebody who already knows all right so

296
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,350
it's the submission page limit at crypto

297
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,680
so this sequence is the submission page

298
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,800
limit at crypto now if you ask me 12

299
00:12:51,680 --> 00:13:00,560
pages how can you write an entire paper

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,449
in 12 pages that's insane and so we

301
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,030
wrote papers in a super condensed manner

302
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,790
because we had 12 pages because we were

303
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,160
writing like if it was for a book which

304
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,020
it was at the time and then we also used

305
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,480
to tell a very funny

306
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,960
well lied that's very painful for when

307
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,460
you're trying to figure out something

308
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:24,560
this will be shown in the full village

309
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:26,300
favor and so I think that considering

310
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,630
this history that we can do better and

311
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,849
so the way we write and read papers so

312
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,040
right now we write papers in the style

313
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,560
of if we were writing for a book which

314
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,900
we did before but now we most people who

315
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,530
read papers they read papers in PDF

316
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:46,060
format so I have a few rules that should

317
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,890
make it simple to make it easier to read

318
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,079
papers to implement and verify the

319
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,689
implementation so the first rule is

320
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,460
simple this is convention that's really

321
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,250
nice for me might not agree but

322
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,990
assignment equality this this makes it

323
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,280
clear when you do equality you can just

324
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:07,700
say equals this is a better one this

325
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,069
rule has never we don't typically what

326
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,370
we do is we write player p1 computes

327
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,339
this player to compute this and what

328
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,930
this does is it saves us lines for the

329
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,150
protocol description which if you

330
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,270
compress into

331
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,579
pagers make sense but now we have more

332
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,350
pages so we can make it clearer so how

333
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,980
do we divide protocols by player idea

334
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,070
around

335
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,000
well we write it like this so this is

336
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,980
much clearer I think much less noise and

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,839
so then you can ask what's the next

338
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,080
thing you can do well now you can remove

339
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,820
useless keywords so locally computes if

340
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,670
you know who's going to do the operation

341
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,320
well it's completely pointless so then

342
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,630
you end up something compressed like

343
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,540
this two more rules

344
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,000
well sample you cannot you know this is

345
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,490
often you can replace it by a symbol but

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,900
then you can see say one action per line

347
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,310
because often when you're describing

348
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,410
protocols you see in the literature

349
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,390
they're putting multiple things in one

350
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,670
line but when you're implementing and

351
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,710
verifying what ends up happening is that

352
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,290
you implement the first part of the line

353
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,430
and then you have to go back you have to

354
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,069
write that then you have to read the

355
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,260
entire part of the line to get to the

356
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,150
second thing and then sometimes it's

357
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,990
even worse because sometimes you know

358
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,949
you have to jump into the end of the

359
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,560
line for the protocol description

360
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:30,400
because you know they say something like

361
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,349
compute f of X Y where Y is blah blah

362
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,689
blah and then you end up jumping around

363
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,959
and then it makes harder to verify

364
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:40,180
harder to implement so then just one

365
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,349
line perfect so in this case you know

366
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,750
they'd say verify and then you can just

367
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,029
yeah so I give the reasons so you have

368
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,130
to often reread the same line if you do

369
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,010
different things or during code you have

370
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,140
to jump back and forth and it makes it

371
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,560
just more difficult to verify and

372
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,020
implement so then there's a rule that I

373
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,290
often see this in text I see Oh check

374
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,520
that this condition is true and if not

375
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:12,250
abort let's just use a keyword for that

376
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,510
this just give a semantic one and then

377
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,160
you don't need to have to worry about

378
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:21,130
that so this is the original protocol

379
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,600
and this is the you know I think the

380
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,630
cleaner and nicer one that you can

381
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,060
actually do and I think it's much easier

382
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,260
to understand this than to read this and

383
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,510
then when you're implementing you're

384
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,319
just going to do each of these

385
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:39,569
operations very easy

386
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,590
and there's another thing that this I

387
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,470
hear if you look at ideal

388
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,020
functionalities in the UC setting

389
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,540
they're often very heavy in terms of

390
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,710
writing you often see upon receiving

391
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,510
this message execute this compute this

392
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:58,270
value and then send this value to this

393
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,840
but then I would recommend coming up

394
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,060
with keywords that you know remove which

395
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,230
we associate to the given semantics and

396
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:11,859
so if I take something like this which

397
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,920
looks quite heavy by applying these

398
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,050
rules I end up with something that I

399
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,910
think looks much nicer then you can

400
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,369
verify each of these conditions this is

401
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,280
literally like pretty much exactly how

402
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:26,500
we would code it actually exactly how we

403
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:31,110
would code it and much makes it much

404
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:34,600
nicer to look at and to understand

405
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,060
versus this one that you know I will go

406
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,129
say okay I'm gonna add this line okay

407
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,919
let me reread the whole part again okay

408
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,470
now I need to add this line then I have

409
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,900
to go okay now I need to add that so I'm

410
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:53,770
gonna go like back and forth and this is

411
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:55,840
much nicer and I'm ahead of time but

412
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,920
that's fine I can have lots of questions

413
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,720
and you'll be happy to go early so

414
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,550
there's a few things that to understand

415
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,590
from the statements first of all from

416
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,659
this presentation first of all standards

417
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,060
can be harmful and it's important to

418
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,730
know that yes you can do harm by

419
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,280
standardizing stuff and in the wrong way

420
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,980
so this is something that is something

421
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,920
to keep in mind but also standardization

422
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,320
can be can give you a way can give you a

423
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,590
like a safety net can give you a clear

424
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,379
and nice way to make sure that your

425
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:32,620
protocols insecure because for for it to

426
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,800
be you know for NPC to become generally

427
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,120
used we need to have we need that it be

428
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,530
robust that we know that the

429
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,530
implementations are really solid

430
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,549
you know try using some of these rules

431
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,529
to simplify protocol descriptions if you

432
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,370
want you can send it to me and I'd be

433
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,259
happy to

434
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,719
you know simplify the description for

435
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:55,269
you you can contact me at Samuel Darin

436
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,350
and Lucy at unbound Tech and you know

437
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:01,149
have fun come see come see the dark side

438
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,480
come at the private industry and see

439
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:07,419
what it's like thank you very much for

440
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,650
this print for the chance to present

441
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,650
[Applause]

442
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:20,220
what a surprise

443
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,360
hello hi thanks for the presentation so

444
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,040
I I like the rationale in the

445
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,250
presentation but I think there's one

446
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,310
element that is missing which is what is

447
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,750
the what is the reason for

448
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,990
standardization and I think there

449
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,640
there's many answers and so one might be

450
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,710
in a particular place trying to

451
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,480
standardize something to be the the

452
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,860
selected algorithm that is going to be

453
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,850
used

454
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:03,310
now forth for everything but I think

455
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,169
you've you've mixed into that the goal

456
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,570
of standardizing for the purpose of

457
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,600
having a better specification in the

458
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,179
better peer review and if you guys if we

459
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,030
isolate that goal then actually there's

460
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,500
no particular no inherent problem in

461
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,050
actually standardizing everything that

462
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,600
we want we could just call it papers

463
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,100
version 2.0 you could even have a

464
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,929
conference where people bring their

465
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,429
papers that were already accepted and

466
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,730
now they're gonna specify it in a much

467
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:33,310
better way and which much better peer

468
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,230
review so the comment I want to make is

469
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:38,500
just that I think it's interesting to

470
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,510
separate the the goal of standardization

471
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,300
as as a way of improving the

472
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,070
specification detail versus the

473
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,350
potential role of standardization for

474
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,200
the purpose of selecting the one

475
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:54,429
algorithm that we want to use in

476
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,320
detriment of all all of the others so

477
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,450
it's more comment any questions yeah so

478
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,210
there's things that are okay so

479
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,960
selecting the algorithm sometimes it so

480
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,270
sometimes there's so many trade-offs for

481
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,780
algorithm there's simplicity efficiency

482
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:14,050
like if you choose an algorithm that

483
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,510
simpler but maybe less efficient that's

484
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,940
easier to implement then there's people

485
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,680
that are gonna you know decide that then

486
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,130
you really need the efficiency and and

487
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,030
so yes these choices can be interesting

488
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,950
you're right there's different

489
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,110
perspective of am I an expert

490
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,120
cryptographer am i somebody who just

491
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,719
wants to use like a particular building

492
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,719
block and

493
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,630
it's a hard compromise there's hard

494
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:43,500
compromises to be made about deciding

495
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:46,140
what to do but having access to some way

496
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,529
so that they can build it and be secure

497
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,539
that they're using the right thing would

498
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:55,260
be good and if they want to extend the

499
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,090
solution okay so it depends on are you

500
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,379
trying to standardize something that is

501
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,449
narrow or something that is general mean

502
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,059
particularly in my in my role of making

503
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,640
the question neither or neither or both

504
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,428
I'm just saying that the the the

505
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,549
realizing that a lot of papers are not

506
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,870
well specified and they should have

507
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:18,480
descriptions that are better specified

508
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:21,299
that can to a certain extent be

509
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,220
modularized away from what is the goal

510
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,799
of standardizing something to be the the

511
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,270
elective protocol to serve as the the

512
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,658
ultimate of livius transfer that is

513
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:35,520
going to be used not a difficulty with

514
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:38,580
that is that you know academia is you

515
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,408
know academics when the published papers

516
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,600
they're they're okay making small

517
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:45,929
compromise they're okay saying yes this

518
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,449
looks fine and first for if you want to

519
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:53,370
use these protocol you know in industry

520
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:56,159
saying oh yeah I think this is fine it's

521
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,889
very dangerous and I think this is the

522
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,390
where standardization can help is really

523
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:05,460
you know making sure that you know if I

524
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:09,539
if I use a sword that it's not gonna

525
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,860
whoops that it's not going to crack that

526
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,590
it's not going to crack and I think

527
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,360
that's part of the the reason why I like

528
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:20,000
standardization is to make sure I have a

529
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,000
sword that's gonna stay in one piece

530
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,340
before your presentation I have like one

531
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,100
unclear questions so it looks like I

532
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,050
appreciate your like space like they

533
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,540
sing all those rules to make paper like

534
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:37,210
I'll read the ball like mom Istanbul I'm

535
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,680
just here to have a good because it

536
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,850
looks for me you are making like a

537
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,580
suggest into syntax vertical papers so

538
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,530
but the syntax to be Pricer like to be

539
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,040
specific you I think we need like a

540
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:54,000
bomber models of how to how to express

541
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,639
your securities do you have any of those

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,960
former models by you listing of your

543
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,660
rules are you talking about formal

544
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,580
specifications yeah it's like in the UC

545
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,040
papers we use like oh three machines in

546
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:12,699
characters means but I think you when

547
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,620
you actually like a write all your rules

548
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,970
or specifications like writing a

549
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,909
programming language you need a couple

550
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:28,420
more models you have any actually like I

551
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:31,180
don't know if you're I think I think at

552
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,850
this level of specification I think it

553
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,760
needs to be higher high level enough

554
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,580
that yeah and bogged down by by details

555
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,370
of like how do I send a message to

556
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,080
others right and then not actually not

557
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,419
by like those data hurt but I mean I

558
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,460
could at least you need some some kind

559
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:53,950
of like semantics are you talking about

560
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,590
formal semantics yes

561
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,240
no I haven't looked at formal semantics

562
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,550
but it would be an interesting thing if

563
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,250
I can actually give formal semantics to

564
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,230
what you know two rules for formal

565
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,220
semantics would be very interesting okay

566
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,480
thank you okay so two comments or

567
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,030
questions or one was going the same

568
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,560
direction as previous questioner it

569
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,920
would make a lot more sense if this was

570
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,629
executable so I mean for for most lower

571
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,640
level primitives we now have a rule that

572
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,480
you have to supply an implementation so

573
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,540
then it's also non-ambiguous what a

574
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,400
certain line means whereas you just

575
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,379
change the syntax and it's not even

576
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,870
getting to what I would say is better

577
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,800
practice by having like the different

578
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,510
parties separated

579
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,790
by distance so when used for instance

580
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,379
the crypto protocol the normal ones

581
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:45,040
where you put a send for an error and so

582
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:48,640
on I find those a lot more detailed than

583
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,430
what I see in years but I was a common

584
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
on this if you plan on going to that I

585
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,870
would rather ask you to specify

586
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,750
something which can be executed then

587
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,669
something which is just on paper so so

588
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,670
get one more step make it implementable

589
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,000
have something behind it be it Python

590
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,170
something script actually yeah that's

591
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,830
first of all that's an interesting

592
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,780
research question of whatever you can

593
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:17,020
take something like read I wrote and

594
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,060
turn it into something more some higher

595
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,550
level description like I did and turn it

596
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:29,040
into some you know the next about yeah

597
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:31,629
yeah but then you okay so I will say

598
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,980
there's a compromise here because if you

599
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,750
do that then the difficulty becomes so

600
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,410
there's solutions that could do that

601
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,300
I think implementations that do that but

602
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,160
then what I think there's a compromise

603
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,680
between doing that and then you end up

604
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:51,010
with problems where if you want a debug

605
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,170
you you're using your intermediary

606
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:56,410
language and you don't necessarily have

607
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:59,860
to access to like the compiler if you

608
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:02,440
versus if you write the code in C++ then

609
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,639
you can actually have your compiler it's

610
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,300
easier to debug and maybe maybe there's

611
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,100
ways to make it actually so I'm not a PL

612
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,010
person but maybe it is possible to make

613
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,429
it do exactly what you said and make it

614
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:22,240
very easy to debug and the other thing

615
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:24,430
is I don't have as much confidence in

616
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,140
standards as you seem to go when you say

617
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,240
oh I would really like to see Audrey

618
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,150
extensions being standardized because it

619
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,650
makes it more secure to me it means one

620
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,840
thing as a standard it kind of closes

621
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,070
the door and improvement so maybe I'm

622
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,810
more with your grandfather there on

623
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,330
seeing the dangers of standardization

624
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:42,159
and if you have something which doesn't

625
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,649
need interoperability but just something

626
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,960
within your company then why would you

627
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,020
want to have standards rather than just

628
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
ask for code review or

629
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,170
getting more eyes on it I mean in

630
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,030
particular is IOT

631
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,770
we still see developments we're still

632
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,720
seeing stuff getting broken so to me

633
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,410
this would be it's not right for

634
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,870
Standardization I think that so I think

635
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:06,120
one of the difficulties for us is that

636
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:09,389
we don't have infinite amount of time we

637
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,580
don't have like a team a large team of

638
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,130
twenty cryptographers we're able to look

639
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,370
at all the issues and you know can keep

640
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,220
updated on all the papers and verify you

641
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:22,860
know all the latest improvements and so

642
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,110
sometimes the literature is kind of

643
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,909
dangerous and it's difficult to go

644
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:30,389
through the literature and understand

645
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,700
everything I agree but I mean if then

646
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,650
some higher energy says hey here's a

647
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,480
standard it does give you a

648
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,220
cover-your-ass you can say all they told

649
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
me to implement it but it doesn't make

650
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,300
your product magically secure and

651
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,760
unfortunately history has shown that

652
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,430
there is not so much attention about

653
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,600
academics to what standards so if you I

654
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,760
don't know whether you went yesterday to

655
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,429
whack there were lots of standards

656
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,680
basically every presentation was showing

657
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,540
at least one standardized and

658
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,000
commercially implemented product getting

659
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,800
broken and smashed often enough years

660
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,080
later so these standards have been

661
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,180
sitting around and just they don't get

662
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,740
to the attention of academics because

663
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:12,870
then that's are typically behind payroll

664
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,820
and so to me it's like well if I saw I

665
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,560
triple me makes a standard somewhere

666
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,720
I won't look because I'm not gonna pay

667
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,190
it and you might think hey it's been

668
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,260
standardized by those people so maybe

669
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,770
it's it's better mmm yes that's so I see

670
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,820
that as a risk as we said a

671
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,650
standardization body will tell will

672
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,510
convey to you hey this is good to

673
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:38,780
implement while actually nobody has

674
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:43,500
looked at it that's something difficult

675
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:45,149
thank you I mean like everything you do

676
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,790
with competitions actually getting lots

677
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,170
of attention that's a good thing I think

678
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,639
but otherwise just saying hey could

679
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,270
somebody please standardize it so that I

680
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,090
get it at least somebody to blame

681
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,789
doesn't make your product more secure

682
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,209
sorry probably taking too much time no

683
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:01,210
that's fine

684
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,990
[Applause]
