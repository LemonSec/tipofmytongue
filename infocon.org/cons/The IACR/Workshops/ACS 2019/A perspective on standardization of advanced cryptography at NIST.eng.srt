1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,889
hello everyone can you hear me well okay

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,549
great so it's a pleasure to be here

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,650
thank you for the invitation I will be

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,390
giving a perspective on standardization

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,770
of advanced cryptography at NIST and

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,990
that's the title indicates it's not the

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,660
perspective it's one perspective I've

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,520
been for two years at NIST so in one

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,530
sense this may be a limited perspective

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,480
because I don't know the full history of

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,600
NIST but I also believe it's a fresh

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,370
perspective with respect to things that

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,170
are whose time has arrived

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:44,309
now namely advanced cryptography with

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:45,690
respect to standardization okay since

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,130
I'll be giving a perspective about NIST

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,739
I want to start with an introduction

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,780
about next and I'll be spending a little

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,989
bit of time kind of explaining how the

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,489
crypto group fits within the NIST

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,260
organization the kinds of standards

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,530
there it doesn't kinds of activities

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,690
that we do then I'll focus the main part

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,969
of the presentation in giving an update

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,289
on threshold cryptography which is one

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:12,689
of our current projects that arguably

27
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,189
can be called advanced cryptography and

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,169
then I'll try to extract some

29
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,818
considerations about the standardization

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,740
process then I'll give a very brief note

31
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,149
on privacy enhancing cryptography

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,490
because time doesn't know how much more

33
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:33,450
and then I'll conclude with hopefully

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:36,479
some interesting remarks ok so NIST has

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,849
been around since 1901 so it is it's

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,200
been around for more than 100 years

37
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,389
previously known as the National Bureau

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,179
of Standards it's a non-regulatory

39
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:47,490
federal agency with respect to standards

40
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,499
and what that means is that we don't

41
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,719
regulate how the standards are going to

42
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,158
be used so for for the most part and for

43
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,798
many stakeholders standards are

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,899
voluntary there may be other agencies

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,590
that then mandate that some standards be

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,619
used in some situations the mission

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,179
statement has a number of key words

48
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,008
innovation competitiveness we do

49
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,440
measurement science and standards and

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,809
technology and we do these things when

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,790
we try to enhance economic security and

52
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,800
improve our quality of life so if you

53
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,569
think of things like for example privacy

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,879
does privacy improved

55
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,149
of life the maid enhance economic

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,819
security if yes then possibly privacy is

57
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:34,920
one would fit in this mission so this is

58
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:37,200
an image of the nist campus is about 1.5

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,069
miles just for an idea of perspective we

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,959
have about between 6,000 and 7,000

61
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:46,798
persons working there are two campuses

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,319
in the US and there's a wide range of

63
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,879
competencies which is divided in in labs

64
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,429
so we have physics measurement science

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,138
communication and information

66
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,659
technologies that's where cryptography

67
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,129
fits and then organs organizationally we

68
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,379
have these labs we're divided into

69
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,120
divisions and then divisions are divided

70
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,429
into groups and then each group has a

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,290
bunch of projects and essentially what

72
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,879
we do is standards research and

73
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,530
applications about these subjects okay

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,349
so the crypto group is within the

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,849
information technology lab which

76
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:25,290
basically deals with technology

77
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:29,629
mathematics and statistics this is a

78
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,620
little slower than I had in mind okay

79
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,268
and then we are within the computer

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,739
security division that works with a

81
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,109
number of things related to security

82
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,889
including cryptographic technology but

83
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,329
also software security risk management

84
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,459
and security engineering and in

85
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,739
particular for example also testing in

86
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,629
validation which in some occasions works

87
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,120
closely with crypto with respect to

88
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:54,209
evaluating cryptographic algorithms and

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,949
cryptographic modules and then finally

90
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,199
we have the cryptographic technology

91
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,389
group where again we have a number of

92
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,849
keywords research develop engineer and

93
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,889
produce guidelines recommendations and

94
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,078
best practices and within the scope of

95
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:13,470
this presentation this is what I will

96
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:17,099
broadly call standards ok the kind of

97
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,649
documents that we produce basically fit

98
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,930
into three categories phoebs which are

99
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,429
federal information processing standards

100
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,380
this is what more formally are called

101
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,219
standards they need to be vetted by the

102
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,469
Department of Commerce then we have also

103
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:33,020
special publications in

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,850
computer security which does

105
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,530
recommendations guidelines and reference

106
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,930
material which again I will be called

107
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,059
broadly a standards in this case and

108
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,430
then we also have nice tires which are

109
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,600
basically internal reports or

110
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,160
interagency reports

111
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
internal from the point of view that

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,120
they're done internally but they're all

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,340
made public and they contain research

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,520
reports in background information namely

115
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,380
about our initiatives such as

116
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,039
standardization of advanced cryptography

117
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,370
and other other fields and very broadly

118
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,960
we interact we have an international

119
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,180
interaction involving several sectors

120
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,120
government industry academia and other

121
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,330
standardization bodies okay so this is

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,730
kind of a very quick overview and just

123
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,409
to have a glimpse of of dementia so

124
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,240
here's NIST with about six to seven

125
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:24,410
thousand persons workers then we have

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Information Technology Group seven

127
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,360
hundred and something computer security

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,660
150 and then cryptographic technology

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,050
thirty something persons I think one one

130
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,480
good reason to show this is to show that

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,640
resources are not infinite so there's a

132
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,680
finite amount of resources and basically

133
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,669
we have thirty something persons working

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,580
in a number of cryptographic programs at

135
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,960
NIST some of these you may have heard

136
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,460
about for example post quantum

137
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,890
lightweight cryptography they're

138
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,210
currently ongoing privacy enhancing

139
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,620
technology in threshold crap

140
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,930
cryptography that's what I'll be talking

141
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,460
about today and then we have other

142
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,720
programs like for example the randomness

143
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,599
beacon which is basically an application

144
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,970
where we promote public randomness as a

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,070
as a public utility also some

146
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,650
applications to privacy and then we also

147
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,919
do for example basic research in circuit

148
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:22,789
complexity and we have a number of other

149
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:23,680
programs okay so now for the actual

150
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,350
standards

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,450
traditionally NIST has focused on what

152
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,520
we may call basic primitives at least in

153
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,240
contrast with what we want to call here

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,979
advanced cryptography and basic

155
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,539
primitive is basically fit into these

156
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,099
things like block ciphers when you want

157
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,680
to insert for something cipher modes

158
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,320
when you want to encrypt arbitrary large

159
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,880
string hash function

160
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,830
signatures interestingly we don't have

161
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,719
here public in cryptography but it's

162
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,340
within pairwise key agreement that we

163
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,450
actually standardized for example RSA

164
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,659
and then we have digital sorry

165
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,979
deterministic random bits generators

166
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,480
there's a bunch of items that we

167
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,880
standardized here and it would actually

168
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,800
be a somewhat interesting talk to talk

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,420
about some of this but that's not gonna

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,790
be what I'm gonna be talking about I

171
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,120
just want to highlight a few interesting

172
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,370
points to show some diversity of of

173
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,410
possibilities so for example AES

174
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,110
advanced encryption standard and sha-3

175
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,840
is a secure hash algorithm version three

176
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,390
were both developed within international

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,000
what we call competitions so this was a

178
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,590
very open in transparent process I think

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,240
it's fair to say that they are very

180
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,219
successful standards from the point of

181
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,140
view of the Trust's and their

182
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,610
trustworthiness but not all not all

183
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:45,260
algorithms have been devised in such a

184
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:47,300
manner maybe in the other extreme we

185
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:51,010
would have cases maybe less known for

186
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,830
example es which stands for ace crowd

187
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,230
encryption standard was something in the

188
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,210
1994 that was basically missed got a

189
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,240
presidential directive saying that the

190
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,609
nist had a certain amount of months to

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,090
to publish this standard and this was a

192
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,040
standard that basically referred to a

193
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,810
confidential primitive classified

194
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,240
primitive so we actually had a standard

195
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,790
where some of the operations that were

196
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,010
going to be executed were not publicly

197
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,780
known and this was a scheme that had a

198
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,450
law enforcement feel that basically

199
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,260
intended to allow law enforcement under

200
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:32,090
certain circumstances to decrypt tech

201
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,880
plain text that had been encrypted also

202
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:39,219
a different use case we have the dual EC

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,990
drbg which is a was the method of

204
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:46,310
deterministic random bit generators that

205
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,950
in 2015 was withdrawn due to concerns of

206
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,510
potential subversion this talk is not

207
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,300
about the things and just pointing out

208
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,769
these things to show different ways in

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:02,488
which different standards were developed

210
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:05,159
okay then we have also interestingly the

211
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:08,569
case of RSA public key encryption there

212
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,949
at least within NIST is standardized as

213
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,449
one of the tools that allows pairwise

214
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,368
key agreement although we don't have

215
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:17,128
public key encryption just the standard

216
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:18,929
itself although we have four for digital

217
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,579
signatures so it's another way in which

218
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:23,519
something can be standardized there's a

219
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:26,069
tool that is that is enabling some other

220
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,709
thing to to happen and just as another

221
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:31,319
example of something that may happen

222
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:33,299
this year very soon we'll have Edwards

223
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:36,569
digital signature algorithm which is

224
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,789
basically a variant of Schnoor algorithm

225
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:40,159
standardized and the reason why I put it

226
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:43,348
here and I find it interesting is that

227
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,559
this was actually in consideration in

228
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:49,049
the 90s when the SI was selected and the

229
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,499
reason one of the weighing factors at

230
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,059
least that weighed on this not being

231
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:56,819
selected at the time was that there were

232
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,439
patent concerns because the algorithm

233
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,478
was patented so it's for example one

234
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,569
consideration to have with respect to

235
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:05,069
standardization okay so this is a

236
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:07,949
general overview some of these standards

237
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:09,389
were specified by reference to other

238
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,718
standards so other standards already

239
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,189
existed and there are basically many

240
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:17,039
methods through which these things can

241
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:19,679
appear either by internal development or

242
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,179
interagency development either by

243
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,218
adoption of external standards that

244
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,468
already exist or by open calls

245
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:29,189
competitions or what we now could call

246
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:30,599
competition like procedures which are

247
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,488
not necessarily exactly competition

248
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:37,079
because maybe NIST reserves the right to

249
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:39,389
to make some some tweaks in the end okay

250
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,738
so just to give also a glimpse of other

251
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,819
processes not mentioned there as I

252
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,899
mentioned the post quantum in the

253
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:47,149
lightweight cryptography are ongoing

254
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,229
processes that intend to standardize

255
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:53,129
primitives that have certain properties

256
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:55,379
like resilience against public quantum

257
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,699
computation and are suitable for example

258
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,899
for IOT in the case of light with

259
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,069
cryptography we also have cases where

260
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:05,830
I'm sorry where should I put the point

261
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:08,209
this to be this way okay

262
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:11,420
we also have cases for example like

263
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,980
pairing based cryptography where NIST

264
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,240
considered the interest of potentially

265
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,530
standardizing it in 2008 had a workshop

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,190
then he had a study and call for

267
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,350
feedback

268
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,900
he made a report about it basing for

269
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,700
basically forming its position and the

270
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,980
position is very interesting but more

271
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,260
research is needed and since then

272
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,730
nothing else has been done but it's

273
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,780
something that can potentially still be

274
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,370
become a standard at some point okay

275
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:41,060
final point about still NIST

276
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:46,280
standardization after the the concerns

277
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:48,500
around the dual EC drbg NIST revised and

278
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,000
formalized some principles related to

279
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,610
the development process of crypto

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,930
standards and so we have this nice tie R

281
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,420
which I would recommend as a reading

282
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,910
it's it's fairly short but it's very

283
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,229
interesting which is basic rude nice

284
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,480
cryptographic standards and guidelines

285
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,050
development process basically we

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,730
formalize a number formalize a number of

287
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,400
principles transparency openness

288
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,730
integrity etc and this is the thing that

289
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,470
we need to abide by as we do new

290
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,040
standards and as we follow new

291
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,960
standardization processes okay so this

292
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,579
was quite an introduction furnace in

293
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,700
terms of time okay threshold

294
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,960
cryptography this is one of our ongoing

295
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,430
projects the goal is to standardize

296
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,400
threshold schemes for cryptographic

297
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,579
primitives cryptographic primitives may

298
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,819
include signatures public key decryption

299
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,040
key generation and ciphering basically

300
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,510
everything that involves the key can

301
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,839
also extend to things that don't involve

302
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,970
keys the basically what we want is to

303
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,060
enable distributed computation of these

304
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,530
primitives in a way that each component

305
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,989
operates only on a share of the key so

306
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,420
no component knows the exact secret key

307
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,580
and basically then we have properties

308
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,650
like tolerance to a number of faults fr

309
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,110
of n faults and then we have interesting

310
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:06,380
properties also like in has resistance

311
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,900
against side-channel attacks this

312
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,610
project raises a number of questions

313
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,920
potentially we we may have many

314
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,960
standards just imagine several standards

315
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,270
for each of the existing standards so

316
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,670
which which ones are we going to

317
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,160
standardize what kind of

318
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,439
are we gonna have what processes will we

319
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,969
follow for this will we in some cases

320
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,920
we'll miss just come up with a direct

321
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,290
proposal and that's feedback to the

322
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,819
community do you agree with this or will

323
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,610
we actually make an open call and

324
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,310
receive any kind of protocol that can

325
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,840
come or will we just look look around

326
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,229
and adopt standards from other

327
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,270
organizations and then it's also being a

328
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,920
very very broad in scope it involves

329
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,870
several areas of expertise so one of the

330
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,849
questions we ask is how can we involve

331
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,860
all the stakeholders basically to

332
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,080
maximize human resources that we have

333
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:58,600
available for this okay I'll talk a

334
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,240
little bit about this project the things

335
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,980
we've done so far so we've done a nice

336
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,800
tie our report on threshold schemes

337
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,110
draft in July we open for public

338
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,630
comments for three months we finalize it

339
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:19,630
in March 2009 19 also in March 2019 we

340
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:24,160
had a workshop open to 22 everyone we

341
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,390
had about 80 attendees and this is what

342
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,370
we've done so far and now what we're

343
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,439
doing is we're drafting a roadmap

344
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,740
towards standardization and immediately

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,470
after that we hopefully well we hope to

346
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,210
get some good feedback about the roadmap

347
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,680
and specifically about items for

348
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,050
Standardization and criteria for

349
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,270
possible calls for contribution where

350
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:48,849
calls for contribution here can mean

351
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:50,980
several possible things okay why

352
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,970
bothering starting with these two

353
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,930
initial steps why don't we just put the

354
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,670
standards out well first off there are

355
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,319
steps in this driving and opening

356
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,150
trasparent process it's part of one of

357
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,250
those principles that I mentioned before

358
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,000
and also because the actual reflection

359
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,650
that we do along the way and the

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,190
learning process that we get is actually

361
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,500
quite useful to determine what we'll get

362
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,110
a few notes on some insights so for

363
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,520
example when we did the workshop

364
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,500
basically we realized we can't just talk

365
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,620
about threshold schemes and say yes

366
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,990
racial schemes are better than then

367
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,520
usual primitives one out of one it

368
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,690
depends on a lot of things and so for

369
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,610
example we define

370
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,900
a little framework basically saying okay

371
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,790
whenever we want to talk about threshold

372
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,140
schemes we need to identify a number of

373
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,780
features what are the kinds of

374
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,490
thresholds what what are the thresholds

375
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,959
for each possible property that we may

376
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,550
want to talk about what are the

377
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,930
communication interfaces with respect to

378
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,339
a client that asks something for the

379
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,560
module because we can have very

380
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,760
different schemes somewhere the client

381
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,770
doesn't know that he's talking about the

382
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,200
threshold scheme others where the client

383
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,060
actually wants to share his input and

384
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,710
then send different shares as a way for

385
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,290
example of preserving privacy of his own

386
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,610
input what are the executing platforms

387
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,860
are we talking about hardware or

388
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,270
software or more importantly are we

389
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,370
talking about a single device that

390
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,230
within it has a threshold circuit is

391
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,880
design or are we talking about multi

392
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,470
parties and then we actually have

393
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,570
basically secure multi-party computation

394
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,850
in them setup and maintenance which

395
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,980
essentially covers trusted assumptions

396
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,220
and then things like are we able to

397
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,110
rejuvenate components when they get

398
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,530
compromised then there's a number of

399
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,360
other items dilemmas about granularity

400
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,920
where should we standardize should we

401
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
standardize the building blocks and then

402
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,620
move up or should we just go immediately

403
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,229
for the 40 actual protocols that we want

404
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,710
to standardize we've got some feedback

405
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,090
in terms of being useful to separate

406
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,010
very clearly the single device from the

407
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,170
multi-party scenario because they are

408
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,330
substantially different

409
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,189
we've got feedback about usefulness of

410
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,650
explaining rationale namely as we did in

411
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,110
the report and we take that as a

412
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:02,380
motivation to do it in the upcoming

413
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,880
process and we also noticed a strong

414
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,439
willingness from the stakeholders to

415
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,720
contribute so we're hoping that indeed

416
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,750
we're going to have collaboration along

417
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,380
this process and we're encouraged to

418
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,119
move forward okay so how about this

419
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,130
roadmap that we are writing well

420
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,948
basically what we want is we want to get

421
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,600
a map we want to decide in which places

422
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,350
of the map we want to go and we want to

423
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,480
know how to get there and what we're

424
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,980
doing for that purpose is we're defining

425
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,720
this thing we call mapping layers which

426
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,430
is basically a coordinate system okay we

427
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,530
know what places we're talking about

428
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,600
will then have weighing factors that

429
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,940
allow us to decide where to go and then

430
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,270
how to get there in particular we want

431
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,360
to going to have collaboration okay

432
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:49,270
mapping layers here's the structure

433
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,189
that we're developing so let this be the

434
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,280
potential standardization special

435
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,160
schemes as I mentioned as a clear-cut

436
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,780
Engel device on one side both parts on

437
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,690
the other side even though some

438
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:06,090
technique sometimes five temple basics

439
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,850
secret sharing is going to be used okay

440
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:13,000
and then we define this concept that

441
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,429
were calling brows as like tracks right

442
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,080
already

443
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:21,940
so route a is what we're calling simple

444
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,050
threshold ization so imagine something

445
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,850
like RSA there's very trivial ways of

446
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,220
threshold Eisinger assay where basically

447
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,010
there's a secret share of the of the

448
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,980
signing key and then each each agent

449
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,379
each party basically does the equivalent

450
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,730
to an RSA with using a sub key and then

451
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,340
in the end it just multiplied everything

452
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,260
so these are very simple there may be

453
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,020
very simple ways of threshold izing

454
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,370
cryptographic primitives that really

455
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,540
don't don't offer much thought to it on

456
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,729
the other hand then we have things like

457
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,440
route beware which we call compositional

458
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,790
or complex designs which would be things

459
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,310
like for example making a threshold

460
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:03,310
version of ECDSA that does not lend

461
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,159
itself easily to to a multi-party

462
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,629
computation except by using secure

463
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,400
multi-party computation generic

464
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,500
protocols same for example for

465
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,300
multi-party a yes and then we also

466
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,730
consider route C because we really want

467
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,080
to keep at least the scope open where

468
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,670
would be things where we're actually

469
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,980
even threshold izing things that we

470
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,170
don't even know yet if they're secure

471
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,420
imagine things like threshold Ising post

472
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,950
quantum primitives well they were still

473
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,980
in the process of evaluating if those

474
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,740
schemes are good so this is really far a

475
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,050
little more far in the future and then

476
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,240
we also put this slightly different

477
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,980
route D which stands for gadgets or

478
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,680
building blocks whatever name you prefer

479
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,740
which would be things like secret

480
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,880
sharing oblivious transfer commitment

481
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,620
schemes consensus etc okay this is a map

482
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,270
this doesn't mean that we want to go to

483
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:58,050
all of these places but but these are

484
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,900
the things that are within the scope of

485
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,450
or threshold schemes okay so just some

486
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,030
conceived examples just to really put

487
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,680
some I mean maybe to call some

488
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,420
motivation for some people really want

489
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,830
to do these things so route they would

490
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,630
be things like RSA decryption and

491
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,909
signatures just use a normal market

492
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,280
property and you have it very easily nor

493
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,560
signatures some versions of it can be

494
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,750
very easily threshold ice key generation

495
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,070
for elliptic curves for example and we

496
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,260
also put here for the case of single

497
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,899
device what we would call a yes

498
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:35,370
threshold circuit design using masking

499
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:37,740
techniques track B ECDSA signature RSA

500
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,290
key generation a yes in ciphering

501
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,610
multi-party version and then for the

502
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,800
single device case there are more

503
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,810
complicated cases that involve

504
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,389
resilience against combined attacks and

505
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,730
then the case C route C the ones that

506
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,580
I've already mentioned and then route

507
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,470
the whatever primitive one may think is

508
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,970
a building block okay

509
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,710
just a note some of these items can

510
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:03,260
actually be some of these primitives can

511
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:05,370
be in different routes because we

512
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,970
because there are different threshold

513
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,830
versions that we can that we may want to

514
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,700
implement and so that brings us to our

515
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:17,010
final layer which is what we call modes

516
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,510
and that's an example these are slightly

517
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,670
generic examples there may be a few

518
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,830
others but imagine basically the

519
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,080
interchangeable mode is the case where

520
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,699
you want to do a threshold version of us

521
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,679
of a cryptographic primitive where the

522
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,890
client does not somebody was asking a

523
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,690
module to do a an operation doesn't know

524
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,820
that he's talking to a threshold scheme

525
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,780
so the interface needs to be exactly the

526
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,370
same the schemes need to be

527
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,040
interchangeable then we have the secret

528
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,100
shared input and or output where the

529
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,159
client wants himself or herself to a

530
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,560
secret share the input maybe as a way of

531
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,780
preserving privacy let's say if he wants

532
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,730
to preserve the privacy of the plaintext

533
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,920
that is being signed or we can have

534
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,230
secret shared sharing of the output if

535
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,630
we want to have let's say privacy of an

536
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,550
output of a decryption and then we can

537
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,140
also consider the auditable case which

538
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,270
would be for example a multi signature

539
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,340
where the client can actually prove that

540
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,379
this was produced by a by a threshold

541
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,000
scheme and that may allow for example

542
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,000
that may

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,040
auditable or good auditable properties

544
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,780
by the way the sides will be available

545
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,310
so in some cases I will skip a little

546
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,590
bit some text okay what is the

547
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,460
development process that we have in mind

548
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,570
well we're currently doing the roadmap

549
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,280
once we have that and all of these

550
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,139
stages will include public feedback once

551
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,020
we have that with public feedback we

552
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,550
intend to do calls with criteria then at

553
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,470
some point we'll have evaluation of

554
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,360
contributions and then at some point

555
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,700
we'll have issue it will issue standards

556
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,560
this is a generic sequence of phases

557
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,520
because again this can go differently

558
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,899
for different items in particular as I

559
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,320
mentioned already a little bit so

560
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:54,110
different items can have different costs

561
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,240
for contribution so in some cases we may

562
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,129
pounder just putting a protocol out

563
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,340
there and asking do you think this is a

564
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,620
good RSI threshold algorithm do you have

565
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,820
any feedback to improve it but in other

566
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,909
cases you may actually ask for new

567
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,669
protocols in other cases let's say for

568
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,440
example route C we may ask for reference

569
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,300
implementations that show feasibility

570
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,840
and research results that show that

571
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,280
those schemes are good that will most

572
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,370
likely lead to different timelines

573
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,020
namely across different routes so what

574
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,649
really what we want to do here is to

575
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,600
keep our options open but identify that

576
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,390
there are things that we can much likely

577
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,520
end you know in a short span of time and

578
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,010
others that would take a longer span of

579
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,900
time and then the actual final format of

580
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,720
a standard can be very variable

581
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,670
so we can consider addendums to existing

582
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,380
standards let's say you have a standard

583
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,330
and I'll just add a little section

584
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,880
saying this is the threshold mode for

585
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,560
this cryptographic primitive in other

586
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,830
cases you may have a standalone standard

587
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,169
or you can reference other standards we

588
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,909
will also be looking for implementation

589
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,220
and validation guidelines because that's

590
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,500
also an important part of the process of

591
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,090
having good standards and then we can

592
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,520
have what we can call reference

593
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,230
definitions which is for example maybe

594
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,200
in many standards we will use secret

595
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,240
sharing maybe at some point it might be

596
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,700
useful to have a reference definition of

597
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,210
what secret sharing is somewhere of some

598
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,210
other were some other gadgets just

599
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,550
again to emphasize this point public

600
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,800
feedback is something that we really

601
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:32,500
want and we're hoping that public

602
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:35,450
feedback can indeed influence the way we

603
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,550
can work the way that we will be taking

604
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,380
including for standardization items for

605
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,530
weighing factors and for a number of

606
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,810
features such as should should we have

607
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,940
schemes that allow dynamic threshold

608
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,190
what kind of security properties like

609
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:54,440
composability and robustness should or

610
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,210
can we have for certain schemes okay

611
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,010
this is the update I wanted to give

612
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,120
about threshold crypto now some

613
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:04,040
considerations may give what I'm calling

614
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,570
a perspective on the granularity dilemma

615
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,110
so one of the things that has been

616
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:13,310
coming over and over is this well it's

617
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,990
actually two ideas one is and I kind of

618
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,879
relate to this one because my background

619
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,780
is in secure computation and usually

620
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,610
when you have papers

621
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,350
we start with an ideal functionality and

622
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,199
then we devised a protocol and then we

623
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,340
prove it secure so one question would be

624
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,960
how about standardizing ideal

625
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,370
functionalities and then everybody's

626
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,470
happy everybody can propose their

627
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,860
protocols well one of the problems that

628
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,900
that does not solve the the process that

629
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,899
we need to have namely for some of our

630
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,590
stakeholders which is the process

631
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,900
whereby vendors need to have validated

632
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,490
implementations to be able to use them

633
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,110
let's say with the federal government so

634
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,820
basically if we if we standardize an

635
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,479
ideal functionality and you and we stop

636
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,310
there that means now every time a vendor

637
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,190
wants to sell their product they're

638
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,110
gonna take it to a lab that an

639
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,120
accredited accredited lab for

640
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,149
certification and now someone there who

641
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,560
is probably not a cryptographer is going

642
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,430
to have to evaluate is this protocol

643
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:13,159
secure not so okay so should we go for

644
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,690
concrete protocols immediately well but

645
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,280
then we go for concrete protocols maybe

646
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,170
we're not achieving the ideal

647
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,970
functionalities that everybody wants so

648
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,800
this is one of the dilemmas the other

649
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,630
dilemma is between building blocks

650
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,330
should we start building blocks and then

651
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,050
should we spend let's say two years

652
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,970
standardizing very formally what two or

653
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,950
three methods of secret sharing are in

654
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,720
the

655
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,190
one of leave is transferred and two

656
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,950
types of commitment scheme so that then

657
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,380
people can build up on that with more

658
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,520
two or three years or whatever or should

659
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,169
we go immediately for complex

660
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,450
constructions but then maybe we'll have

661
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,909
a lot of redundant work well the the

662
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,260
idea I want to advance maybe it's a

663
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:52,330
little abstract but I think it's an

664
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,120
interesting idea is that we don't really

665
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,439
have to well first off if we go on the

666
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,870
middle point in any of this

667
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,640
we're basically also not solving any any

668
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,039
problem so the idea that I want to put

669
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,750
forward is that actually all of these

670
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,029
areas have a place in the

671
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,529
standardization process and

672
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:09,730
unfortunately I don't have enough time

673
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:12,309
to kind of stay a few minutes in this

674
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,169
slide but just as an example maybe we

675
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:15,820
can relate it to threshold cryptography

676
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,070
although I think this is more general

677
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,899
for other standardization goals as well

678
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,149
imagine that actually what we want is a

679
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:24,549
goal at least for threshold cryptography

680
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:28,389
is to actually have a protocol that does

681
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:29,710
thresholds make the threshold mode of a

682
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,890
cryptographic primitive so we really

683
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,419
want to have the protocol but we want to

684
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,750
get there by passing through the ideal

685
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:40,179
functionality so maybe or in some cases

686
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:46,899
you can interpret ideal functionality as

687
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:49,860
a a complete sorry a comprehensive set

688
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,760
of security assertions and an interface

689
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,490
just for cases where a deal

690
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,760
functionalities might not be the right

691
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,950
version so maybe this point could be in

692
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,539
the point of defining criteria so maybe

693
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,580
one we want to define a threshold mode

694
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:06,100
for a threshold scheme maybe we can

695
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,539
define an ideal functionality that could

696
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,789
even be part of the feedback that we get

697
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,200
from the public and then when we ask for

698
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,840
a call for contributions we're actually

699
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,960
asking please show us protocols that

700
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,809
satisfy this ideal functionality and

701
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,610
then on this side we want to have

702
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,139
certain we want to have completely

703
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,729
associations of building blocks let's

704
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,529
say commitment schemes there are many

705
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,820
ways in which we can do them maybe hash

706
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:35,590
based or Pederson commitments so we want

707
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,260
to know how we do them in order to

708
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,360
achieve this but we don't necessarily

709
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,340
have to define our initial goal of

710
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,408
standardization to be a building block

711
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,330
and have to wait to get to this point

712
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:49,000
maybe it's enough initially to

713
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,250
know what kind of building work we need

714
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,720
and then when we define the build the

715
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,769
actual protocol that we want we know

716
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,700
that we're gonna have to instantiate

717
00:28:53,769 --> 00:29:00,220
this anyway the diagram is left on the

718
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,700
slides wicked and left from our

719
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,980
reflection another point standardization

720
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,350
versus adoption so what makes a standard

721
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,179
good well should be a well done

722
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,870
specification definitely but it also

723
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:15,730
depends on the context so I would say a

724
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,610
good standard should be a reference for

725
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,409
let's say best practice is in minimal

726
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,899
defaults for example picking up again

727
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:24,580
with the threshold cryptography if now

728
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:27,279
we're providing a way in which people

729
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,678
can share their secret and not having in

730
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,539
a single in a single place if you have a

731
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,789
key leakage from someone who was not

732
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:35,889
using threshold crypto then we can ask

733
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:37,750
well maybe at that point threshold

734
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,658
crypto was the best practice why was

735
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,120
this company not using threshold crypto

736
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:45,909
a good standard would allow

737
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,320
interoperability would be suitable for

738
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,299
validation certification of

739
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,678
implementations and would be also a good

740
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,110
reference to what to innovate upon

741
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,389
however standards can also possibly be

742
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,969
bad for example if compliant in context

743
00:29:55,389 --> 00:30:00,039
where compliance is required a standard

744
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,510
would be bad if if the techniques are

745
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,950
obsolete or outdated and for example if

746
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,529
we cannot verify and validate

747
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,149
implementations that are actually prone

748
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,440
to error for example if you need to use

749
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,570
randomness but there's no way of

750
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,950
verifying this randomness is good and if

751
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,889
the randomness is bad then everything is

752
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,720
broken for example and standards can

753
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:21,879
also be bad if the process does not

754
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,710
allow for correction withdrawal or

755
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,880
replacement of the standard when the

756
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:32,799
standard should indeed be replaced ok

757
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,919
I'll move to speed 1.5 still try to

758
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,120
cover all the things I want to cover

759
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,990
another aspect that I think is relevant

760
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,979
is the aspect of intellectual property

761
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:47,679
it's often a delicate aspect but I think

762
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,510
it's worth considering explicitly and

763
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,720
what I want to say here is basically

764
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:55,179
based on the NIST information technology

765
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,789
lab policy which is a few things that I

766
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,740
find are quite reasonable first off is

767
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,340
we can at least ask for this closure of

768
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,900
patents

769
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,639
I mean it's nothing it's we're not

770
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,590
saying good or bad about people having

771
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,930
patents but disclose them if you're

772
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,610
being part of a process in particular we

773
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,110
can call for disclosure at any time

774
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,290
including for people that don't have

775
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,699
patents but know about other patents and

776
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,020
depending on the process for example if

777
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,120
we have an open call for submissions

778
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,030
then we can actually put in some

779
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,709
conditions for example conditions that

780
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,620
the licensing in case somebody has a

781
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,960
patent that at least makes a patent that

782
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,340
is usually called friend which would

783
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,770
send for fair reasonable and

784
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,480
non-discriminatory now one point worth

785
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,040
mentioning is that actually let's say

786
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,640
for example the case of NIST we can't

787
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,100
force

788
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,140
we can't force any third party to

789
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,240
disclose that they have patents or that

790
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,630
they will enable this kind of licensing

791
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,240
terms however when we do guidance in

792
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,790
standards we can have our own condition

793
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,250
which is well if at some point we find

794
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,139
that this is under a patent for somebody

795
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,940
with not going to license it in a fair

796
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,760
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms

797
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,250
then we have the option of making that

798
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,020
no longer a part of the guidance I've

799
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,210
included in the slides not for for the

800
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,980
talk now but if in case you want to

801
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,160
consult some of some excerpts of the

802
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,930
actual policy another aspect just as an

803
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,520
example is that I think it's useful with

804
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,410
respect to the standardization processes

805
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,480
to make transparent and to have a

806
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,920
traceability of the evolution of

807
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,750
documents to know why things were

808
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,760
changed this is one example of something

809
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,890
within the threshold crypto which was we

810
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,720
had a draft report and then we basically

811
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,340
compiled the PDF version where we had

812
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,500
all the public comments and

813
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,899
corresponding answers and then we had

814
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,520
references to all the places in the text

815
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,470
where changes were made and I think

816
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:46,270
that's quite useful with respect to to

817
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:48,340
traceability of changes okay privacy

818
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,040
enhancing cryptography it's really very

819
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,020
brief but just basically to claiming

820
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,300
that we are in the arena so we have this

821
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,790
back project privacy enhancing the

822
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,290
project the goal is to so we're

823
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,300
interested in privacy that can be

824
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,860
promoted by cryptography this includes

825
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,450
techniques such as your notes proves

826
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,610
insecure multi-party computations and

827
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,460
basically we want to keep up to date

828
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:12,219
with external initiatives that's that's

829
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,240
a main goal and an important goal in

830
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,800
terms of output is to produce reference

831
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,480
material which does not have to be

832
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,460
standard but it will be material that

833
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,930
will be useful for several purposes it

834
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,030
will allow us to assess the state of

835
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,100
things in a particular area let's say

836
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,990
like your knowledge proves it will

837
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,790
motivate applications and proofs of

838
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,890
concepts in use cases that's something

839
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,790
that can actually promote that later in

840
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:39,010
time this technology can be standardized

841
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:41,139
it may frame the further development of

842
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,080
standards that's something we consider

843
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:47,170
important basically we can along a long

844
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,510
time direct ourselves where to go and it

845
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:53,170
may reference material may by itself

846
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,460
enable interoperability across across

847
00:33:53,170 --> 00:34:01,990
people that actually want to use this

848
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:03,370
technology okay so one one example of

849
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,670
something that we're doing currently is

850
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,719
we're interacting with Zika proof which

851
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,090
is one of the standardization

852
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,679
technologies there will be that daniel

853
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,800
is organizing and that will be discussed

854
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,760
also during this workshop basically

855
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
proof is an effort towards

856
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,540
standardization of zero knowledge proof

857
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,520
it's an open initiative of industry in

858
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,320
academia and one of the things that it

859
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,500
does is produces open documentation in

860
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,450
this fits our reference material

861
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,850
approach so what we've been doing is

862
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,560
that we were asked by Zika proof earlier

863
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,659
this year for feedback on their

864
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,270
documentation and we decided to engage

865
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,919
with them so basically a few things that

866
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,550
we did we ported the initial

867
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:44,350
documentation into latex we provided

868
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,850
some comments and then we proposed an

869
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,759
editorial process to develop the

870
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,259
documentation into a community reference

871
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,580
then based on that we also participated

872
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,080
in the second workshop and we're now

873
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,909
also in the process of producing

874
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,000
contributions with the rest of the

875
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,950
community so in summary this is one

876
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,690
activity one example of an activity that

877
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,399
supports advanced cryptographic

878
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,990
standardization where we're not

879
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,570
necessarily saying we're doing a

880
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,490
standard on this right away but we're

881
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,310
collaborating with that initiative and

882
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,319
just still within the realm of pact we

883
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,140
are that we also want to promote promote

884
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,640
secure multi-party computation but no

885
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,440
time in this presentation for that but

886
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,940
hopefully in the future soon future will

887
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,490
have things to talk about

888
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,540
okay concluding remarks

889
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,799
okay the title contains advanced

890
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,270
cryptography but we didn't really talk

891
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,620
about what is advanced cryptography I'm

892
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,360
just gonna leave it as a question where

893
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,279
as a number of questions so what is it

894
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,810
that makes what is it that makes it

895
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,470
advanced at least regarding

896
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,940
standardization is it that we have a lot

897
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,339
of times protocols let's say with

898
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,070
distributed systems within it instead of

899
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,080
a single single side primitive where

900
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,330
somebody just doing let's say signature

901
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,000
is it because we have many paradigms and

902
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,680
options to choose from is it because

903
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,030
we're using complex techniques that were

904
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,640
not previously standardized that may

905
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,420
also be a case at least for example in

906
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,990
the case of secure multi-party

907
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,660
computation certainly or is it simply

908
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:09,930
because we have an uncertainty of of

909
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,220
what path we should we should take well

910
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,069
I'm not gonna give an answer but just

911
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,660
make two notes which is well first off

912
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,600
what is invested they can be basic

913
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,049
tomorrow so we never know what the best

914
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,720
is and one point that I think I mean

915
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,520
it's I think it's really interesting to

916
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,100
reflect about this maybe we actually

917
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,440
also need more advanced standardization

918
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,630
processes and this might be what we need

919
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,790
to tackle advanced cryptography

920
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,710
standardization okay

921
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,830
so just to have a call for collaboration

922
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,910
here in these conclusions we want to

923
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,620
collaborate with open and transparent

924
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,899
processes towards standardization of

925
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,160
advanced cryptography so please do let

926
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,410
us know if you want to collaborate with

927
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,890
NIST in any of the initiatives that we

928
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,480
are driving or any of the initiatives

929
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,000
that we are collaborating with other

930
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,730
people that are taking the lead

931
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,680
just two more concluding slides so this

932
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:05,520
one with concluding remarks just a

933
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,870
number of items so just a statement NIST

934
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,820
is interested in the development of

935
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,410
advanced cryptography and this includes

936
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,020
secure implementations technology

937
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,990
adoption interoperability standards

938
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,330
reference material etc the standard

939
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,359
development process matters so it's not

940
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,860
just the final standard whatever

941
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,840
preconceived vision we may have of it

942
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,910
but we really feel that especially for

943
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,710
advanced cryptography we are exploring

944
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,920
and we are learning with the process

945
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:34,380
learning by doing not everything should

946
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,590
be standardized by NIST something should

947
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,250
but not everything still that's not an

948
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,280
impediment

949
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,450
we can collaborate with those things

950
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,160
sets of final standards can be of

951
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,689
several types can be what we typically

952
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,980
envision as a standard but again can be

953
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,109
other things can be referenced

954
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,380
definitions can be addendums in some

955
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,970
documents the standard standardization

956
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,990
considerations go beyond technical

957
00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:00,209
security involve trust for example and

958
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,180
evolve a lot of things within the

959
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,980
process another one that I guess

960
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,359
sometimes is relegated humans are part

961
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,730
of the equation so we don't have

962
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:12,509
infinite resources and so collaboration

963
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:14,070
inter stakeholders is essential in just

964
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,490
also as a final statement NIST is

965
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,380
currently active in threshold crypto and

966
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,660
privacy enhancing cryptography and just

967
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,140
to finalize with the question which of

968
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,330
today's developing standards will remain

969
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,460
let's say 70 years from now as building

970
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,840
blocks of Advanced Krypton the reason

971
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,690
why I chose seven years just because I

972
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:37,290
want to show a cool picture which is

973
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:39,240
from NIST this is actually a wall that

974
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,450
exists in NIST it's called the NIST own

975
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,939
test wall was built 71 years ago to

976
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,189
study the performance of stone subjected

977
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,560
to weathering and so you have here the

978
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,330
photo in 1948 it still stands but

979
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,099
actually if you go close by you'll see

980
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,290
that little little stones are actually

981
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,170
quite eroded and others are still

982
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,480
standing firm but actually I think it's

983
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,240
a cool question to ask like what will be

984
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,040
crypto in 70 years and are we are we

985
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,500
looking towards developing standards

986
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,180
that will be there where we'll have good

987
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,750
durability or

988
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:17,710
I mean difficult to answer of course and

989
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:24,710
thank you very much for your attention

990
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:24,710
[Applause]

991
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,720
Thank You Louis and mommy's not a

992
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,520
question just a comment from the

993
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,439
perspective of the steering committee of

994
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,750
the Zika proof standardization effort

995
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,190
I would like to strongly commend nist

996
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,040
and Louis personally for their

997
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:51,050
involvement in our effort they've been

998
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,770
extremely invaluable in bringing their

999
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,800
hard-earned lessons about

1000
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:59,550
standardization and what matters and how

1001
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,470
to do it properly and it's unusual and

1002
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,690
very encouraging to see them nurturing
