1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,059
so I'm going to talk about you know the

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,820
extermination process and seek approval

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:16,520
it's been thinking about today and

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,790
yesterday and I'm sure you heard before

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,939
anyway so so okay so let me talk about

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,189
standardization so I think the I was

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,720
cautious well to put it above I thought

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,480
maybe people would have talked about it

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,780
before today but I'm actually glad

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,700
putting it because we are kind of alike

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,739
in though in a day of standardization so

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,640
what does it mean to standardize right

13
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,680
so okay so to bring into conformity with

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,280
the standards especially in order to

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,460
assure consistency and regularity so in

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,290
some sense is that benchmarking

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,200
conformity and what does it mean to -

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,379
what is the standard as if you could go

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,540
to Webster so okay so it's a banner for

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,520
running cry etcetera but maybe that's

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,560
not what we want but it is something

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,470
starting establish my authority custom

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,810
and general consent to Maude as a model

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,109
or example so really so this is

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,090
something a benchmark that we know what

26
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:18,710
we're doing that we know what we're

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,020
doing is good so so this is instance the

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:29,149
the goal of a standard but we know there

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:31,490
is more so so really what the goals of

30
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:34,369
for for this for standardization process

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,958
in general Sweeney what it is what you

32
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,109
want to create an agreement and an

33
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,819
object to make him to make the world for

34
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:44,030
more efficient so so this is something

35
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:46,299
different than setting a standard or

36
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,219
benchmarking just to create agreement

37
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,950
and this is for interoperability from

38
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,350
all the raw design just to help us build

39
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,609
better world more efficiently but there

40
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,038
is really also this issue of

41
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:01,520
benchmarking that to know that what we

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,189
have is good enough and different levels

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,630
of goodness etc and this is also

44
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,880
important so we are playing between

45
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,549
those two things well there are the

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,769
reasons are such that they're protecting

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,530
business interest you know in actually

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,630
must have much of the world several

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,790
bodies this is the main goal

50
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,320
we don't want that just to say that we

51
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:26,209
don't want that so so just put it aside

52
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,980
but another issue but another good thing

53
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,330
about standards and actually the process

54
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,649
actually was said earlier is the process

55
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,510
of translation it's getting people

56
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,040
together and it specifically getting

57
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,170
people from different walks of life

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,720
different backgrounds to again something

59
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,369
this process itself as I'll tell you and

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:50,210
I experience is really it's a great

61
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:51,950
thing better so you know I saw but a few

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,220
words about standardizing photography so

63
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,100
we've heard the talk earlier about this

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,859
you know some great points were made but

65
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,940
let me just say you know maybe with some

66
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:08,150
repetition but these points again so

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,070
someone we standardized script also so

68
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,500
the first thing the obvious thing is to

69
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,820
you know standardize the API is the Kami

70
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,280
software the the interface formats and

71
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,370
whatever interfaces they are and we of

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,200
course people to standardize the

73
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,230
operational correctness like again like

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,060
any software for instance you know if

75
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,209
you the clip but you encrypt it with the

76
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,660
same key you get the same message great

77
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:39,530
but this is you know most standards stop

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,470
here but but for crypto is there is much

79
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,290
more to go so so so how do standardized

80
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,220
security you know so it's really kind of

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,290
think about it it's it's a hard question

82
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,930
fact how to even specify security

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,700
requirement is not it's not it's not

84
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,070
always agreed with many different ways

85
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,070
to specify security permits from from

86
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,970
certain objects even simple ones let

87
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:08,650
alone complex ones but even how to

88
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:12,500
convince people that we actually need a

89
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,780
security requirement is not trivial so I

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,579
can tell stories from you know war

91
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:23,150
stories from 95 96 I was a French you

92
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,099
know PhD graduate work in IBM following

93
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,020
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo craft you here

94
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,950
know you know I'll tell about them

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,590
anyway so and I was

96
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,990
was following who go he was love living

97
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,929
the was involved in the sand ization

98
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,090
process of IPSec people remember without

99
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,430
you seconds everybody knows IPSec

100
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,320
you know it's for still the old days of

101
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,270
the internet was still fledging we're

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,070
all even optimistic we were sure we

103
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,169
don't design it's right

104
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,240
you know IPSec is gonna be the protocol

105
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,040
of choice you know if all the traffic is

106
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,760
going to be encrypted at the IP layer

107
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,750
no no traffic hijacking no nothing you

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,190
know didn't work

109
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,500
also these were days where you know

110
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,820
section 230 were just passed but still a

111
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,220
good thing we didn't know what it's

112
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,770
gonna bring us today but never mind

113
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,940
that's another story but but anyway so

114
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:17,020
we were you know in in the IDF

115
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,730
standardizing IPSec and and and and they

116
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,210
it was really hard to convince people

117
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,730
there to make the point that one is to

118
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,320
you know standardize security it's a

119
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,380
security protocol to actually have

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,020
notions security and actually make sure

121
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,700
that whatever sunrise meets those notion

122
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,310
answers some assumptions in some model

123
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,039
and remember you know there's some very

124
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,590
vocal people there know you know really

125
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,600
making jugos life hard you know this

126
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,760
self opponent cryptography is trying to

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,290
make us do extra work you know so it's

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,599
it's a and then who go in his comm

129
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,820
Argentinian way in very charm you know

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,160
very calmly answers everybody lengthly

131
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,180
and friendly and with a smile and kind

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,010
of diffuses all antagonism I rent a lot

133
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,500
on this process not just about crypto

134
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,150
but how to deal with people but but but

135
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,010
it's a I think they may be the the well

136
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,719
it eventually they were you know a

137
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,810
second standardized you know this was

138
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,370
specific about each mark and I think

139
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,090
that maybe the great thing about a

140
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,290
schmuck maybe this is the one first a

141
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,200
cryptographic scheme that was

142
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,510
standardized kind of be kind of not

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,150
exactly but almost exactly because it

144
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,280
has a security analysis there are other

145
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,770
schemes were certainly more efficient

146
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,109
but did not have any and for good reason

147
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,169
so but it's really a great win for

148
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,660
Gooden so so just the fact that there

149
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:47,070
should be a security

150
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,140
requirement is something maybe to the

151
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,990
people sitting here it's not it's you

152
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,940
know to convince you but just to say

153
00:06:51,990 --> 00:07:01,200
that it's not so obvious to many other

154
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:03,510
people and anyway so so so then okay

155
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,990
well to be a kind of agree on a security

156
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:10,890
requirement whatever it is then what

157
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,570
what assurance do we require you know we

158
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,729
want the proof so you will prove the

159
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,890
very reduction usually you know but to

160
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,020
what assumption and what parameters and

161
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,460
how to you either put the assumption

162
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,380
against the parameter had to compare

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,479
reduction to one assumption with some

164
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,159
parameters versus reduction to another

165
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,580
assumption with different parameters you

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,250
know what's better what's worse and then

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,680
what kind of cryptographic for proof we

168
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,720
want you mean do we allow heuristic such

169
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,190
as random workers do we not mean do how

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,390
how far do we go

171
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,670
you know program well no programmable

172
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,469
you know how to talk about all the

173
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,270
things in the standard and it's hard and

174
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,000
once you actually want to standardize

175
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,390
and compare things it's not it's not

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,490
easy it's not trivial at all and then of

177
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,650
course it's not doesn't and there then

178
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,540
what level do you specify the code right

179
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:02,370
see it's not enough to specify an API

180
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:04,350
you standardize a security transform

181
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,860
mechanism so you want to specified it

182
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,450
down to the you know to the in specific

183
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,690
programming language in what programming

184
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,700
language do you want to say specified

185
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,280
everything down to the to the attitude

186
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,669
to the to much to to the machine code

187
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,299
and the specific hardware do you want to

188
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,310
do you know PL style analysis Ottoman

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,680
analysis so this all things mean it's

190
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,810
not clear what to stop I mean it's

191
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,599
obviously it's many different things but

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,510
where do you draw the lines so

193
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,880
standardizing crypto is really far from

194
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:45,270
trivial even for very simple things to

195
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,430
do it to do it right and and then

196
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,020
extended I think protocols it's even

197
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,609
more so because for the cost a really

198
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,160
complex objects and not just simple

199
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:58,670
schemes so the encryption as you know

200
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,800
with encryption signatures and not even

201
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,199
not simple to buy anyway but what

202
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,790
protocols are even more complex you know

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
the several parties different concerns

204
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,939
you know it's hard to capture security

205
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
again it's it's not clear how to do that

206
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,670
right and how to standardize and compare

207
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,160
in benchmark protocols and then it also

208
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,689
depends on other mechanisms I mean all

209
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,709
you always depend on other things or

210
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,560
even start

211
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,830
but since work was kind of higher in the

212
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,229
stack they would depend on more stuff on

213
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,940
the networking stack and also the actual

214
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,850
network you work in because it's

215
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,560
distributed so again how do you think

216
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:43,880
about all those things so so you can

217
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,449
imagine that when I was approached last

218
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,350
January even even half ago but yeah but

219
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,000
by Shafi you know saying how about you

220
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,650
know do some standardization to zero

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,490
knowledge we just did we just started

222
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:01,550
destination for fhe and it's great let's

223
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,810
do that so firstly actually like what

224
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,459
you know we're so far away from there

225
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,819
you know let's start crawling before we

226
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,650
do marathons it's just you know but but

227
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,830
then she insisted you know I said you

228
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,209
know but people actually using it and

229
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,980
and we're gonna have to leave it

230
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,900
whatever they do no matter what so why

231
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,230
don't we just try and make it better and

232
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,620
whatever we can

233
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,810
yeah okay and but but but where do we

234
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,880
start how do we even think about these

235
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,479
things but what really can standardize

236
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,010
so then she said you know why not just

237
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,620
do one step at a time let's just have a

238
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,569
meeting and whatever whoever is involved

239
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,690
then have a committee and a meeting and

240
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,660
then we'll see what happens and okay and

241
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,670
this is what we did and it's really in

242
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,630
retrospect it is really but we don't

243
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,160
know where it's going yet

244
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,510
we still in you know a year half into it

245
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,360
we did a lot of progress but still in

246
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,710
the first stages but now I'm sure that

247
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,959
this was the right thing at the right

248
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,389
time and there was no

249
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,138
I mean this thing to do even if it looks

250
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:11,180
crazy because as we said the process and

251
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,529
sometimes even more important than the

252
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,359
end result and the process already

253
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:21,139
proved itself even without anything else

254
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,999
so so here's the steering committee that

255
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,009
the Chaffee and I think people would

256
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,759
carry that organized it started with

257
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:30,050
Sofia vor and Danielle here put together

258
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,730
say I would say it may be more in the

259
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,498
end of it for forgiving you know daniel

260
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,249
has been amazing for this process

261
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:39,379
without him nothing would have happened

262
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:42,829
but anyway so this is the distinct

263
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:47,379
committee I think Daniel is not even

264
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:53,809
written here why okay

265
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:56,720
okay so so so so and then we had our

266
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:59,329
first meeting which is a pub publicize

267
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,019
it whoever you know we try to reach

268
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:06,138
everybody that we can and this was the

269
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:10,579
first meeting I know how many was sixty

270
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,499
something people right yeah and and it

271
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:17,149
was it was nice and there were lots of

272
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:19,459
nice pictures and and the you know the

273
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,779
agenda was you know it says also what

274
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,248
are you doing such a meeting right here

275
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,259
get some people together

276
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:26,209
and you know maybe a couple of plenary

277
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,709
talks in the beginning to you know to

278
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:33,018
make everybody feel together and feel

279
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:35,469
happy and then body so so so so what we

280
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:39,949
did we can have a game took example from

281
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:45,679
the home of encryption effort so we said

282
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:47,719
okay let's do three tracks to split up

283
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,959
to three groups and the tracks that we

284
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,160
did were security we called it which

285
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,910
essentially was kind of the theory

286
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,259
people you can algorithms definitions

287
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,118
and then we had another group of

288
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,980
applications which try people trying

289
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:04,819
like let's see what the applications we

290
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,309
have and we had implementations which is

291
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:10,910
a third group and each breakout group

292
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:14,209
met for quite a bit when a number of

293
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,769
hours over two days I tried to hash out

294
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,130
things people's explain what they were

295
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,420
doing

296
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,920
we're trying to understand what

297
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,829
everybody else is doing it tried to come

298
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,540
up with some document to school to come

299
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:33,100
up with summarize what happened and we

300
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:36,439
did that and it was very rewarding and

301
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,620
and it takes you know that's maybe my

302
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,650
personal take from the awful documents

303
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,530
from the being there correct me if you

304
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:47,569
think differently so first there was an

305
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,220
immense interest in putting a geo

306
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,220
knowledge into it to practice well

307
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,970
number of different applications many

308
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,920
different people which surprised me and

309
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,500
then there were three min three main

310
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,860
application in years that we we came up

311
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,660
with a thing this was kind of the the

312
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,700
one important first step so so so one is

313
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,949
politically fiber non-interactive

314
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,280
succeed knowledge kind of like general

315
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,830
snarks and this is like for now for

316
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,920
national transactions blockchains

317
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,990
z cash for instance and and what what's

318
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,930
important for those applications is

319
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,510
succinctness and verify verify

320
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:34,300
efficiency for the verifier you knows

321
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:36,860
everybody all the miners in transparency

322
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:42,979
particularly from string etc should be

323
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,840
transparent another setting was and it's

324
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,430
and it's supposed to be non interactive

325
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,400
it's very important of course it's not

326
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,560
interactive second setting is designated

327
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,569
verifier non interactive knowledge again

328
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,640
non interactive but this is something

329
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,340
it's the different sort of applications

330
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,189
for anonymous credentials of supply

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:05,240
chains provenance of data will secrecy

332
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,650
so here actually the prover is the guy

333
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,650
that's supposed to be efficient but

334
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,959
often this is the weak guy and anyone

335
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,630
succinctness but maybe not a 16 with the

336
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,190
pentagon on the application and again

337
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,780
composability with other proof because

338
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:22,540
if you want to do things over and over

339
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:25,490
again or put together credentials etc a

340
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,010
possibility and a third setting was

341
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:34,670
interacting with your knowledge

342
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:37,430
which is mostly for running within other

343
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,420
protocols the PC protocols etc and there

344
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:44,120
you know it was more like application

345
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,560
specific but overall fishin see in

346
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,540
amortization because you want many of

347
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,099
them usually the same time within

348
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,599
context etc and so that's that's one

349
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,030
thing and another thing that came out of

350
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,490
this that I think is that we need a

351
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:01,280
common language and common api's because

352
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,290
otherwise you cannot work and when you

353
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,140
say API this means that really API is

354
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,910
for for you know formatting and fields

355
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,590
and what fillings are what and also but

356
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:18,890
also for security ApS for fourth year

357
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:21,260
knowledge in his in his context and okay

358
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,030
so and it was it was kind of like seemed

359
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,910
clear that most of the interest was in

360
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,150
the first increase the people in the

361
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,790
room then what were the first are the

362
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,260
first applications general snarks second

363
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,329
was the second one and the third was

364
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,370
relatively few people and this feeling

365
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,070
was enhanced in the second meeting which

366
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,040
said you know man

367
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:47,390
[Music]

368
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:51,589
so so so it's just of interim worked it

369
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,689
we did so so first we it took a while to

370
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,160
actually twist the hands of the people

371
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,960
that were supposed to do it then people

372
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,319
in the in the first meeting but we

373
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,390
didn't do it and we got a summary

374
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,730
documents from the three breakout groups

375
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,930
who actually was very useful and then we

376
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,449
kind of thought there was really

377
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,010
interest I mean it was clear this is

378
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,320
something that's going to continue that

379
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,390
son is going to be not one of things so

380
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,409
we should take ourselves seriously

381
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,630
so we said Charter and conduct and some

382
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:26,870
standardization process which we luckily

383
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:32,960
took from NIST took from ITF and and it

384
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:36,350
was it was so so be it would be and we

385
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,620
said some process for ourselves and and

386
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,469
we and then we compiled

387
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:45,189
a document I think Daniel compiling

388
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,730
document overview in the technology and

389
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,799
setting in some terminology and I think

390
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,720
it's a great document I mean even if you

391
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,610
don't want to participate in standards

392
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,049
in you but you are interested in

393
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:01,709
technology it's really worth reading

394
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:03,759
it's broad its extensive it provides a

395
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,960
overview of what's there what's the

396
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,759
interests and and set some common

397
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,539
language in terminology which is very

398
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:18,700
important and then we set a second

399
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:20,619
meeting which happened last April so

400
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,779
there was no some reason there's no

401
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:26,860
picture of everybody together but there

402
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:29,669
were lots of small pictures yeah yeah

403
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,668
okay

404
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:40,178
yeah okay sorry for the wrong page and

405
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,610
do you think okay so anyway so so but

406
00:18:40,179 --> 00:19:13,409
the second meeting was actually there

407
00:18:42,610 --> 00:19:15,070
were many more people there were so

408
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:20,100
thank you sorry

409
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:22,749
so so so over 150 participants I know

410
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,689
something like that so it's really more

411
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:28,299
than twice than the first one and it was

412
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,610
three days rather than two days and we

413
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,799
had many presentation it's like around I

414
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,840
counted around 30 presentations of

415
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,029
people about from different you know for

416
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,649
applications for from theory and was

417
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,690
really interesting there were there are

418
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:46,299
two panels and several breakout sessions

419
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,879
of different topics and and and most

420
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:50,918
importantly lots of horrible discussions

421
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:51,730
with me a lot of a lot of discussions

422
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,090
there

423
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:57,880
and in one thing that it was clear that

424
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:01,840
the community is converted to people

425
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,780
again there converge mostly in again in

426
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,149
the general snarks which was the first

427
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,560
bullet from before but not not

428
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,070
exclusively so there of course is

429
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,320
interesting the other ones but the most

430
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,720
of the interesting to be in the public

431
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,850
liability efficient verifier xvi

432
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:28,660
approved in the you know for context of

433
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:30,250
payments block change etc so but then of

434
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,710
course there is a lot of innovation

435
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,810
there

436
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:41,140
so in fact we have current currently we

437
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:43,210
have three standard proposals that for

438
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,010
any discussion there is a many discussed

439
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,870
and remaining this social fear you

440
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:53,470
should feel free to look at the energy

441
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,270
anomaly at least contribute and and and

442
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,160
contribute your own proposals well it's

443
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:05,740
really it's a vibrant community and midi

444
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:09,580
participate so and what i want to do

445
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:14,350
with the rest of the time i want to to

446
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:17,590
talk more about the api and about the

447
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,840
zero knowledge API and and talk a little

448
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,659
bit about the way we were thinking of

449
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,480
doing it which is against via this you

450
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,710
see framework that was a great talk

451
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,750
about it yesterday with a great

452
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,520
motivation by andrew that you know i

453
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,930
could not have done it better motivated

454
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:38,620
better than what andrew motivated it but

455
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:43,390
it's really seems like the more we are

456
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:45,449
dealing with this it seems that if we

457
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,519
want to have

458
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:51,669
standard you know a reasonable good

459
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,380
useful standard of crypto standards of

460
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:55,630
cryptographic primitives which are more

461
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,690
than just the basic things of inner

462
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,350
encryption signatures and of protocols

463
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:07,779
and primitives that will allow for you

464
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:10,600
know construction of sound software and

465
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:13,169
applications that don't just

466
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,658
interoperate but actually are secure

467
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:20,320
then this in some sense the only way we

468
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,760
have to go it's not that it's perfect

469
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,070
it's far from perfect and there are

470
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,908
issues here but which don't have any

471
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:34,809
other the other thing so I just want to

472
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:38,500
say one more thing about this versus let

473
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:42,039
me say it now versus the ITF

474
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,750
standardization process so so since the

475
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,240
ITF civilization process is something

476
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,700
which is inherently orthogonal to

477
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,860
security because what they interpret

478
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,480
they standardized is the API terms of

479
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,459
what goes on the wire they have this

480
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,909
philosophy of not standardizing things

481
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,559
beyond that so so they now realize that

482
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:02,080
there's some times that you have to

483
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,720
sanitize also things how things operate

484
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,960
inside endpoints not just on the wire

485
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,159
specifically for crypto but it is very

486
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:16,720
limited and and the ITF is really in the

487
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,820
in the in the mindset of standardizing

488
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,529
four into a probability just what's

489
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,750
going on the wire we don't want to mess

490
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,980
up with the the the internal

491
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,070
implementation that's none of our

492
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,620
business and this is like inherently

493
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,590
incompatible symbol security because if

494
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,570
you want to to talk about security you

495
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,850
have to talk about security at the API

496
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,730
it's not at the links but the API is

497
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:42,250
inside your computer between the you

498
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,070
know the the application that called you

499
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,049
and and the protocol and it's impossible

500
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,439
to talk about security without that and

501
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:52,179
and the ITF is doing you know in some

502
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,679
sense some crimes there for instance

503
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:58,360
they talk about TLS security it's really

504
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,880
it's really

505
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,649
look at the TA standard and say then

506
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,240
it's secure not secure because things

507
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,090
are not specified there in the API

508
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,950
between the TLS and the the application

509
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,779
it's not even written because it doesn't

510
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,200
it shouldn't be written if you talk

511
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:15,580
about just communication API however you

512
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,769
can't talk about security without

513
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,250
talking about you know the the inter

514
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:22,570
process API is within at the endpoints

515
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,970
and in fact I've been talking to people

516
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,330
who implement new TLS you know and

517
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,059
perfectly by the by the book but in the

518
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:35,139
end point all the keys are sitting in

519
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:38,080
some in some database is accessible to

520
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:40,149
everybody in the computer well there's a

521
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,779
complaint by the standard nobody says

522
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:46,600
otherwise but about you know you cannot

523
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,309
call it secure so and this is something

524
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,899
where if you want to standardize

525
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:51,820
security protocols you have to do it

526
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,979
differently when you cannot do it kind

527
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,080
of IDF style in the sense of inter

528
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,940
probability you have to go deeper into

529
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,629
the guts of the protocol and talk about

530
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,559
the API and also the implementation okay

531
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:08,470
this was just a side comment but that

532
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,658
said let me talk about how we're

533
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,559
thinking about doing the API first your

534
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:17,529
knowledge which is this is using this

535
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:21,190
you see favor so this is again it's a

536
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:24,519
work in progress to decide I stole the

537
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,950
slides from moto who gave the talk in

538
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,260
April in the end of April workshop

539
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,580
I'm only to some point but at some point

540
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm going to do something different

541
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:37,658
because I think we learned more than

542
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:44,799
since April this is still a work in

543
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:46,690
progress okay so in progress so so you

544
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,629
know so what is the game let's go back

545
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,850
to the roots your knowledge G Mar 1995

546
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,799
and in the National Journal

547
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,408
there's just says that you know why how

548
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,799
to what it deals you know it says for

549
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,860
any poly time adversary there is a

550
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:06,220
verifier adversary verifier there is a

551
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,408
polynomial time simulator such that this

552
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,190
you know whatever the very far learned

553
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:14,160
from the interaction with the proof

554
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:18,870
can be simulated by the simulator by

555
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,490
itself just knowing the input or without

556
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,250
knowing anything had to do with the

557
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,350
witness okay so this is the basic idea

558
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:30,270
of physiology I think we all know and

559
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:33,959
love but now we want to actually use it

560
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:36,260
in life and and we know that this

561
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,260
definition doesn't compose so let me not

562
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:43,170
you know tire you with example meters

563
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,690
you know sure half of people here know

564
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:49,140
the other half didn't know and that's

565
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,990
not the place to learn but the point is

566
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,340
that the geo knowledge don't impose in

567
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,470
the sense that you can have rather

568
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,790
proposed naturally let's say so you can

569
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,220
have protocols that satisfy the

570
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,350
definition but still Munir on two of

571
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,970
those protocols alongside each other or

572
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,250
maybe they want for polar lumps and

573
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,050
something else they all security breaks

574
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,470
the witness goes comes out there is no

575
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,850
security whatsoever so so it doesn't

576
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,030
mean that your knowledge protocols it

577
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:17,370
cannot be used in protocol settings in

578
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,470
general it doesn't mean that there's

579
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,020
been that the natural way to compose

580
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,450
them is we think about like in

581
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,980
programming languages you know just have

582
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,300
a subroutine and you call it then you

583
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,600
know another server team you call it

584
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,180
this doesn't work okay so what this mean

585
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,090
is that this definition is really

586
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,880
unfriendly to building secure protocols

587
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,070
right you have to do something else so

588
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:49,200
so this is the the problem that the UC

589
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:53,370
is trying to to resolve and keep that so

590
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:57,350
sorry so the so the approach is to

591
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:59,429
actually do something that you can use

592
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:03,719
as an off-the-shelf

593
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,990
subroutine as you will do in any you

594
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,890
know programming language any you know a

595
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:16,560
library of of subroutines that you would

596
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:18,720
do so so you do it just with security so

597
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,389
so let me just say so so what is the

598
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,200
idea the idea is that again the security

599
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,510
of the system

600
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,070
of what

601
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,379
of the the system that you build the

602
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,480
protocol that you build is only

603
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,809
reflected in the way it up it affects

604
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,150
you know the external system out of it

605
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:39,639
both the the honest part is did you use

606
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,080
it and the side effects too it's true

607
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,789
sir channels whatever they are

608
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,399
adversarial effects

609
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:47,799
therefore to in order to capture the

610
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,340
security and functionality of some

611
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,168
system your protocol P what you got to

612
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,939
do you want to start the first you write

613
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,559
in a dual system and a little

614
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,440
functionality that capture the desired

615
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,510
the fact that it's important here the

616
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,840
desired effects are both the

617
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:07,870
functionality in the sense that you know

618
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,059
if you you decrypt message encrypted

619
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:12,850
with same key then you have to get the

620
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:14,950
same message right or in general as you

621
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,469
know if the X is in the language you

622
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,720
know X and W radio in the relation then

623
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,659
the very fresh would say one and the

624
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,539
security right and the security means

625
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:27,039
that you don't learn anything else

626
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,990
nobody learns what more than what

627
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,059
they're supposed to by the functionality

628
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:35,530
I mean the functionality should define

629
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:37,658
both what every party should learn from

630
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,120
the interaction and also what everybody

631
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:42,880
should not learn and what combination of

632
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,158
parties should not learn so how do we do

633
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,289
that right so then you have to to try

634
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,650
the functionality that does that so

635
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:52,750
we'll get to ability to how do that and

636
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,169
then he says once you have that then you

637
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,270
say that system is secure for this

638
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:01,960
functionality if it looks the same for

639
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,760
any external environment and and how

640
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,700
exactly this is follows it doesn't

641
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,770
really matter right now

642
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,929
but but the point is that you know again

643
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,370
every just therefore in order to to

644
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,490
specify the effects you know what we

645
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:19,479
care about specific efficiency of how F

646
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,970
is written although for composition we

647
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,710
need F to be stupid normal time but the

648
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,460
point is there this is kind of the core

649
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,830
of the of offer exercise but this is

650
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,650
going to be the API and the API is going

651
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,840
to be this F

652
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:39,330
is that capture within it both the

653
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,520
functionality and the insecurity okay

654
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,770
and we need in API that on the one hand

655
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,020
we can realize on the other hand we can

656
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:51,000
use so as usual okay

657
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,389
so so just to say it so so what does

658
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,780
secure composition means you know but

659
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:01,800
the notion means is that the you want

660
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,210
the protocol the composition under code

661
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
the compressibility of this ephemeral

662
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,080
comes into effect in the following

663
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,530
statement is that if you want the

664
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,120
protocol even in the concurrent setting

665
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,830
with the purple is running with you

666
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,610
concurrently with many other protocols

667
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,699
or many instances of itself running the

668
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:23,459
protocol is as correct and as private as

669
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,820
you know as if you will replace every

670
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,360
instance of the protocol with with this

671
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:33,780
added functionality right so so here the

672
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,490
system with two instances of the

673
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,620
protocol here you know there's a man in

674
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,200
the middle a woman a woman in the middle

675
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,780
between two endpoints and running two

676
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,030
instances of the protocol and this

677
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,720
should look the same to everybody as if

678
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,010
this woman in the middle is is actually

679
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,360
interacting with this ideal function of

680
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,379
two instances of the dysfunctionality

681
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,928
and and then the way it's formalizing in

682
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:02,460
the definition is that you actually take

683
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:05,520
all these guys and so you have here that

684
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,500
the two adversaries which we know for

685
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,600
any abuse are here there is an adversary

686
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,309
that they were the simulator and then

687
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,689
the this other interaction or calling

688
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:22,320
protocol if you want to call it is

689
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:24,510
replaced by by an environment which is

690
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,939
just one of a third machine it's just to

691
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:32,850
distinguish between the real in the idea

692
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:37,440
okay so this is how the definition works

693
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:39,360
and this is how the logic works and then

694
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,810
okay so both both they always say the

695
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,639
simulator

696
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,639
Pournami time also the environment

697
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:52,399
okay so so so how do we know about how

698
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,559
to realize things in UC security so in

699
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,209
general you cannot do it for any

700
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,850
protocols there are protocols that you

701
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,190
cannot particular for zero knowledge you

702
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,678
cannot just do zero knowledge from

703
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,600
scratch with UC security as opposed to

704
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,049
the actual definition which is looks

705
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,610
like a bomber but but you also cannot do

706
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:12,259
an on track with your knowledge from

707
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,379
scratch you need some setup assumption

708
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:20,000
and in fact the self-service setup

709
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:26,120
assumptions that work for knowledge or

710
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,139
knowledge also work for for for UC

711
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,928
security so what we can do is with this

712
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:35,570
setup we can actually say realize it

713
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:38,360
with India with orange majority but this

714
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,860
is not the case here for us with your

715
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,799
knowledge because you have only two

716
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:45,590
parties all we need a common reference

717
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,029
ring or public infrastructure or certain

718
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,668
model there's a bunch of different

719
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:51,379
things but for our case before general

720
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,820
snarks we're talking about a reference

721
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:57,860
drink either it's a publicly generated

722
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,189
or probably generated while talking

723
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,168
about a reference tree so there are

724
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:08,149
relaxations but never mind that

725
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:10,159
no so so so let's talk about the vanilla

726
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:15,319
general functionality the way it was

727
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:18,649
thought about earlier on so so what what

728
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:23,418
is the API so there is this environment

729
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:26,929
which sits at above and it gives the

730
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:28,969
Prudy gives the prover here's ID which

731
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:31,760
is identity or whatever for the for the

732
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,509
transaction and here's an X and here's

733
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,990
the W

734
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:41,329
eyewitness and it gives just X to the to

735
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:43,388
the verifier and and then in the real

736
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:47,139
execution to verify the pave the way for

737
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:51,290
interact and then the verifier

738
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:54,440
just gives out the output in the ideal

739
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,668
model there is no protocol instead the

740
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,130
prover the verifier interact with

741
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:02,000
zero knowledge functional functionality

742
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,970
and which works like that so

743
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,069
so first the the prover gives the X and

744
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:12,930
W to the FD a to the functionality

745
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:16,529
functionality our records X and X and W

746
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:21,328
and just gives out to the verifier the X

747
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:23,250
DX and the one bit answer so and that's

748
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:25,770
it so what this means it means two

749
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,290
things it means that the verifier learns

750
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,210
the right bit which is what's supposed

751
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,609
to learn it also means the dazzling

752
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,319
anything else so it's completely all the

753
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:36,270
rest is completely hidden from it in the

754
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:43,170
ideal world you have perfect soundness

755
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:46,380
and perfect zero knowledge so so this is

756
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:49,799
great which is nice but somehow it's a

757
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,720
velocity functionality but it's not

758
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:53,520
really good for music and it's not

759
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,808
really good for us specific for the

760
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,569
applications of snarks because we in

761
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,630
particular in this application in this

762
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:07,680
interaction there is never a proof

763
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:10,109
string so the verifier just gets the one

764
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,390
bit answer there is never a proof string

765
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:14,339
whoever actually sometimes you actually

766
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,660
need a proof string I mean particularly

767
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,950
applications we need the proof thing

768
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,020
because actually the proof swing in

769
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,910
order to prove on top of it writing me

770
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,130
to compose things we need a proof string

771
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,649
in order to maybe sign it to show it

772
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,859
later so there is this proof string

773
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:33,210
actually has meaning and it has value in

774
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:35,190
the context of of general snarks so so

775
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,500
so this is to ideal in some sense so

776
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,940
it's actually hides too much from the

777
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,770
implementation but part of the

778
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,099
implementation the proof string actually

779
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:45,270
is important so therefore we need to

780
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,670
actually write a different ideal

781
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,170
functionality that captures that and

782
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,930
that's actually a lesson also in general

783
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,970
the if you do you know this style of

784
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,169
providing security requirements the way

785
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,299
you write the deal functionality is very

786
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,160
important because you can write the same

787
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:01,589
thing you know for the same primitive

788
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,210
you can again define define security in

789
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,130
one way and it works and otherwise it

790
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,400
doesn't work and so it's really

791
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,960
important to do it right so so here's

792
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,160
another way to write

793
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,990
you know its functionality for

794
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,930
non-interactive geo knowledge and this

795
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:19,379
actually this is from paper form I think

796
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:23,069
so

797
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:27,030
growth of Rothstein's hi so the way they

798
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,349
do it actually they do the the the proof

799
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:33,390
and the verification in two different

800
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:36,270
parts so the first thing the prover goes

801
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:40,020
to well let's talk about how it works

802
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:42,570
music in the real world the prover gets

803
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,560
from whatever for the the person who

804
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:49,109
calls him an X and the W and it returns

805
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,279
the proof well not exactly because there

806
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:55,140
is a serous so the prover actually first

807
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
gets the serious and and then he goes

808
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:01,560
and sends back the the proof in the

809
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:05,730
Sierras this is how the poor side and

810
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,140
then the verifier will do you know will

811
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,800
verify but let's talk about the proof

812
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,900
the prover so now that the digital

813
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:16,200
functionality would have to look like

814
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:21,390
that so it gets again the X and W from

815
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:23,460
the prover it records X and W and it

816
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,910
gives X to the simulator no W called

817
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,220
secret access similar to get some proof

818
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:38,270
and and reference range whatever and

819
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:40,919
send it back and thank you and and and

820
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,930
so they again here the string the proof

821
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,180
string is part of the functionality and

822
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:48,750
then the verify side is the same thing

823
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,290
right so it gives now the that reference

824
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:54,630
ring and the the proof and the X and the

825
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,670
very first first one sensor one in the

826
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,710
real protocol and in the dual protocol

827
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,060
the way it will work it will again the

828
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,349
verify will go give it to the

829
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,440
functionality the functionality will

830
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:06,720
just look up in its database to see if

831
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,359
it's there if it's there to says ok if

832
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,390
it's not there it will actually go back

833
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,069
to the simulator and give it another

834
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,990
chance to say you know maybe now you

835
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,910
want to give it a proof that if the

836
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:20,160
prover was the sanest eternal never mind

837
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,080
so but anyway the functionality doesn't

838
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,100
say yes unless it actually sees a

839
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,549
witness and the pill verifies

840
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:30,130
witness works so again we get perfect

841
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:34,990
soundness and perfect your knowledge and

842
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,350
now we have a proof string so so far so

843
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,959
good

844
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,940
it's of the big be good but in the in

845
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,620
the twenty seconds then I've left let me

846
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,630
just say okay so now that comes the

847
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,440
issue of succinctness because the stocks

848
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,680
have to be succinct

849
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,500
alright and there is an issue with that

850
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,419
succinct proofs we know that they cannot

851
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,620
be proven under some standard assumption

852
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,160
the only way we know how to do them

853
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,529
unless you know one day we'll be smart

854
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,029
enough to do non Redbox reductions then

855
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,670
everything will be fine we'll be able to

856
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:07,150
prove snarks from one with functions so

857
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,520
what but until then we don't know how to

858
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,640
do that so the only thing we can do is

859
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,660
to do these this knowledge assumptions

860
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:21,100
and in those assumptions only work for

861
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:24,670
specific type of of in all the services

862
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:31,120
simulators in particular in the context

863
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:34,660
of UC security what we have is that the

864
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,690
type of of extraction that we need if we

865
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,420
do it directly on UC security and the

866
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:43,390
directly of the protocol is actually

867
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:49,420
impossible assuming are your exists but

868
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:51,370
IO exists so it's impossible so so so so

869
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,780
we actually we don't have any way to

870
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:58,060
realize music in the right way so that

871
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,340
we can actually use it in a composable

872
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,590
way for applications and then prove it

873
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:07,060
and so whatever you kind of like you

874
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:09,580
know we went up I went you know a tall

875
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:12,370
order we went up a climb up a tall tree

876
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,630
now we don't know to go down which looks

877
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:18,190
kind of a problem

878
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:21,010
but but luckily so it's operable here

879
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,770
but luckily there is a way out and it

880
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:28,060
can be done in in restricted settings

881
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:29,530
and this is again ongoing work but the

882
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,509
restricted second is the following we

883
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:35,920
just finished in a second so assume that

884
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:37,750
we have the proof is of a restricted

885
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,750
form there is

886
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,760
seed witness if there is a witness you

887
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,710
know there is an X and there's a W which

888
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,510
is the witness by an addition we assume

889
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,060
this witness is structure there is a CID

890
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,060
witness which is short and the rest long

891
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,620
of the witness which may be long is

892
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,340
actually computed in for a lot more time

893
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,230
from the short witness and and the point

894
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,660
is if this is the case so that so this

895
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,450
is the criterion that we want and what

896
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:07,450
we show what we show is that if this is

897
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:12,580
the case then you can actually have you

898
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:14,589
see secure snarks such that the the poor

899
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,020
the proof size and the very far complex

900
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,850
it depends only on the length of as the

901
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,440
seed of the witness and of course the

902
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,509
proof of complexity is poor anomaly in

903
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,900
the statement as before and the the

904
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:28,780
point is that if the observe asian is

905
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,730
that actually the the known application

906
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,700
of snarks in particulars et cetera

907
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:36,340
actually this is enough you don't need

908
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,629
more than that so we are going to be

909
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:42,450
good to this again is work in progress

910
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:42,450
is it's been written hopefully without

911
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,139
[Applause]

912
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:08,920
analyzed in this algebraic group models

913
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:10,120
that don't rely on concrete assumptions

914
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,860
that don't have proofs on concrete

915
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,440
assumptions what do you think about

916
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:22,960
those are they so for Standardization

917
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:27,820
should we ignore them with you okay so

918
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,950
so suggest those constructions to say

919
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,450
you can show that they realize you since

920
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:35,319
your knowledge we don't need this crazy

921
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:37,319
thing not in general right etc I don't

922
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,120
know it's a that's gained the issue of

923
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,720
community decision right and the thing

924
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,630
is like what will happen if if something

925
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,250
will go wrong right so you know so like

926
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,850
the people in the forum our community

927
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:54,520
they're going in all kinds of

928
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:56,200
you know to VC's and to people with put

929
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,420
money in those things that say we have

930
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,609
zero knowledge proof without assumptions

931
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,900
you know no setup in no assumptions kind

932
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,910
of like forget that there is a random

933
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,060
work out there then what do you do okay

934
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:08,740
but then one day somebody will break you

935
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,840
this and because the hash function

936
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,850
doesn't work and then what do we do then

937
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:18,660
all of us look crazy I don't know that's

938
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,660
my thing but

939
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,779
[Applause]
