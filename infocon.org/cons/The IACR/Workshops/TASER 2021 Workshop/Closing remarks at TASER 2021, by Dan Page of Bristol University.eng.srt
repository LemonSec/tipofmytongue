1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
a few closing remarks i don't have too

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,200
many but for sure i want to say um some

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
thanks and particularly to the speakers

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,240
at the workshop for

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,840
their time and their effort especially

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,519
simon who i think came from another

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,800
meeting so he's had a busy evening um

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
also to kay for the technical help as i

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,400
said at the start i don't think we could

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
do that without that help

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
and then finally for everyone for uh

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
attending um i said at the start there

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
was some debate whether this workshop

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
made sense but i think the kind of

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
number of people with some interest sort

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,920
of validates that

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
um i've never really seen a successful

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
round of applause on zoom um but maybe

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,719
you can sort of show some love in the

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,320
chat window for the speakers and that

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,840
acts as some kind of replacement or i

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
can give you a

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,519
a visual round of applause anyway

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
oh everybody can unmute and clap their

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,480
hands huh we're not going to crash soon

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,360
try try hard

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,119
thanks to dan for organizing it
