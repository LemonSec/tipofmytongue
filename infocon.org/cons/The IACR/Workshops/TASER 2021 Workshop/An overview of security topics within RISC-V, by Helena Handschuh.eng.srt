1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,639
which is from elena hanchoo

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,160
helene is a fellow at rambus

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,680
specializing in cryptography and

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,559
embedded security and has been involved

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,000
with risk five

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,320
as the chairperson of the security

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,639
standing committee so she's going to

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,519
give us

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
a kind of an overview of security

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,520
related topics within risk five i hope

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,640
that's not too bad of representation

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,600
no that's perfect

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,679
all right thank you for the introduction

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,320
let me try to see if i can share does

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,280
this work can you see my slides

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
yes yes that works great

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
okay cool i'm trying to go full screen

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so let me know if that doesn't work out

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
then i'll

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
make it smaller but

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,120
okay so uh just a little bit of an

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
overview this uh first talk

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
there's really nothing technical in it

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,840
it's just so that people get a good

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
understanding of kind of how risk five

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,399
works and how you can participate in

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
security activities how you can be part

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
of it how you can bring something to it

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,119
and how you can benefit from it uh in

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,360
return

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
so let me move forward see if that works

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
too yes okay just going to do one more

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
thing which is move the little bar at

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
the top otherwise i don't see the text

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
zoom

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
okay here we go

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
uh so respond at a glance so the

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
chairman of the board are christopher

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,799
azanovich and david patterson you might

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,200
have heard of david patterson before he

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
has received the

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
acm touring award in 2017 and they both

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,079
have been involved in risk five in risk

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
for a long time and in risk five more

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
recently

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
uh the ceo of the organization is

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
callista redmond there's a cto called

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
mark himmelsheit

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
uh there's also somebody in charge of

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,720
visibility that's kim matmo

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
and it's a rather big organization now

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
there's more than you know 13 premier

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
members and like 150 strategic members

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
which means companies and bigger

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
organizations

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
and more than a thousand members in

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
total so these are all combined together

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,720
over a thousand but you can actually

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
join so if you didn't know you can join

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
as an individual and there's no cost to

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
that at all it's completely free

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
you can also join as a university and

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
that is also free i believe since last

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
year or so

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
so there are many ways of joining and

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
there should be one that fits you

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
okay so what does it do well it owns and

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
standardizes the

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
base specifications of the risk five

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
instruction instructions at architecture

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
which is composed of two specifications

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
the unprivileged one and the privileged

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,680
one

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
uh it's completely free and open meaning

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
anybody could download it use it for

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
anything you want

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,680
and it also

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
starts creating extensions now so from

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
the base there are extensions built on

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
top of it and we will see some of them

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
are actually relating to security we'll

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
see that a little bit later and

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
following in talks following this one

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
it does

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
standardize these additional extensions

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
for all sorts of things for example for

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
specific acceleration for specific use

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
cases for specific applications

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
so there is one dedicated to crypto for

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,280
example but there's also many others

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
dedicated to all sorts of other use

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
cases and applications you might have in

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,920
mind it goes all the way from hyperscale

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,840
height and spectrum to all the way to

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
the iot tiny embedded devices so no

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
matter which

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
market you're in which segment you're in

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
or what you want to study or accelerate

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
or optimize there'll be there'll be one

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
for you and if there isn't one you can

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
join and create one that's the cool

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,839
thing about it

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,120
um

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,599
there is also now starting to be a

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
software and hardware ecosystem so for

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
that you can visit the risk five dot

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
work

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
exchange site and there you will see

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
everything that

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
people have contributed so far so

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
contributions by members themselves and

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,599
then there's

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,799
tool chains simulators boards software

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,120
security solutions people contribute all

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
sorts of things um and it's very

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
interesting to see that you can

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
use it to try out your own your own

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
implementations and so on not everything

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
is free from what has been contributed

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
by the members um sometimes you'll find

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
people have you know commercial

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
solutions posted there but you can pick

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,840
and choose and surf around and see

124
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
what's available

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
there is

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
uh documentation there platform

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
specification profiles and so on and

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
everything that

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
sorry everything that risk five does is

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
public

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
all the mailing lists are public all the

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
information is public

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,280
mostly everything is posted on github or

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
google docs wiki

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
and on that special link here

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
lists.risk5.org

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
the only thing that you have to be a

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,479
member for is in in order to participate

139
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,800
and to contribute and to influence

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
what's going on otherwise everything is

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
just public and you can

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,160
you can use it download it and so on

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
okay so that's risk five better class

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
see if i can get to the next five

145
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
no

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,240
yes okay just a little bit of an idea of

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,840
what the structure looks like the

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,639
technical organization looks like this

149
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
it's a it's driven by a board of

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
directors of members of the different

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
member companies and then there's a

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
technical steering committee and the cto

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,440
and then there's all these groups that

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
are working on all sorts of different

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
things so you can see here um

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
the main two

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,639
areas are the unprivileged spec

158
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
and the privilege spec here and what's

159
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,880
in green shown in green is already

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,520
ratified that means that it's stable has

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
been voted on and it's not going to

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
change going forward

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
and then there's all the technical

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
working groups the tgs that work on

165
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
different extensions

166
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
they're all listed here i'll say a few

167
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
words about them but not too much you

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
can go on the website and figure out all

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
of the groups that exist

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
and then there is so-called horizontal

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,600
groups so that means these are groups

172
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,240
that have specific interests

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
but that kind of span all of the

174
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
specifications so for example

175
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
the one we're interested in of course is

176
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
security

177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
um and this one is kind of involved with

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
all the other groups as well because

179
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
there might be you know people might be

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
writing specs inventing new specs and

181
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
introducing security bugs so

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
we need to be taking a good look at all

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
the other specs that are being written

184
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
to make sure that security-wise we're

185
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
happy with them so anyway these are

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
horizontal groups that go that have a

187
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,639
special interest that goes a bit

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
everywhere

189
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
safety is another one that some people

190
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
might be interested in that's a little

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
bit more automotive related but that's

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
also a horizontal group

193
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
and then in the task groups themselves

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
we have two of them that are very

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
specifically creating

196
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,560
security extensions or documentation or

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
guidelines or things like that so one of

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
them is the crypto task group

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
and the other one is the t e task group

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
they're both highlighted in blue here

201
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
and we will hear i believe later on in

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
this workshop from the crypto group

203
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
that has just uh published a

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,360
specification for review and we will

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,319
also hear from the chair of the te task

206
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
group uh all the different other

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,039
security topics that are going on beyond

208
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
just crypto in terms of you know how to

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
secure the system so there's two talks

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,199
dedicated to that later on

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,479
okay

212
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,960
now what we have already as i mentioned

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,319
before is two specs that are stable and

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
have been stable for a while so these

215
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,639
are the base specification

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
uh the first one is the usual level iso

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
which is the base specification which

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
kind of doesn't have too many privileges

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
at all that's that's the top one uh

220
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,720
where you um sit at the top on above all

221
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
of the other ones that have more

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
privileges so this one has been stable

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
since about 2019 even before that but

224
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
it's been ratified in 2019

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
and it gives you all of the base isa and

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,080
32-bit 64-bit 128 bits

227
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
and on top of that it has extensions

228
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
available already so for example uh

229
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
extensions for atomic instructions you

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
see all of them listed here on the right

231
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
hand side single

232
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,839
single

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,679
precision floating point double

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
quadruple floating point decimal

235
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
floating point compressed instructions

236
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,839
and so on and there's two that kind of

237
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,320
relate to security and crypto a little

238
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
bit more than the others

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
that will be mentioned by some of the

240
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
talks later on as well one of them is

241
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
the bit manipulation extension and the

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,519
other one

243
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,680
is the vector extensions and these two

244
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
are very helpful for doing for example

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,480
so that's number one

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,880
and then number two

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
is this one

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
the privileged architecture document and

249
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
that's the document that's also been

250
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
ratified in 2019

251
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
which defines the three actually four

252
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
modes but only three uh two of them are

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,959
ratified today plus the user level so it

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,519
defines machine mode supervisor mode and

255
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
hypervisor mode and people working on

256
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
the hypervisor mode right now but the

257
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
machine and supervisor ones are

258
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
completely stable and you can go ahead

259
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
and implement them and these are the

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
ones that start giving you certain

261
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,320
privileges compared to what you can do

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,080
the closer you get to the hardware what

263
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,279
you can do

264
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,040
uh in terms of using the the

265
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
instructions what you're allowed to do

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,560
all right so these are the base

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
specifications that were

268
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
uh so to speak donated by

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
christopher and dave patterson and a

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
bunch of other co-authors

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
to the foundation itself when it was

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
created a few years ago and this is what

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
risk five works with and is trying to

274
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,640
extend as we go

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
okay now a few words about security

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
how am i doing on time a little bit more

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
you have about 10 minutes left maybe a

278
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
little bit less

279
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,279
okay cool

280
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,200
uh all right so let's talk a little bit

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
about security now so there's a security

282
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,120
committee which is a horizontal

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
committee as i mentioned before remember

284
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,360
the one that was blue and horizontal

285
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
lines

286
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
this one was created around july 2018

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
there was already security activities

288
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
going on before that but in 2018

289
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
kind of as a follow-up to the spectre

290
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
and meltdown

291
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
aspects

292
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
and and attacks

293
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
the organization decided to actually

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
create a standing committee for that

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
which is a committee that doesn't

296
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
necessarily produce specifications but

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
that gets together to discuss any

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
important security aspects that should

299
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,519
be dealt with and also which

300
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
task groups to create that should

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,160
actually come up with new specifications

302
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,079
and extensions to deal with certain

303
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,480
security issues

304
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,200
so

305
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,079
um the new chairs have been elected in

306
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,920
july of 2021 so i've had as a done uh

307
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,760
paige mentioned i've had the pleasure of

308
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
chairing this uh committee about three

309
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,680
years and then i thought maybe it's time

310
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
for somebody else to do that now so um

311
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
there have been elections in july of

312
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,760
this year and the two new chairs are um

313
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
manual often derick from seagate and

314
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
andy dallow from huawei

315
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
i think they still use the same mailing

316
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,279
list so security at lists.inspact.org

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
that hasn't changed as i said all that

318
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,720
gets posted on this is public so you can

319
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
go ahead and see what they talk about

320
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,399
what they're discussing if you're not a

321
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,720
member of it yet

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
um and all the documents are currently

323
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,880
still posted on this listsrisk5.org

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
website which is not necessarily public

325
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,720
for the moment but there's a plan to

326
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
migrate everything to github soon so at

327
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,079
some point all of the discussions all of

328
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
the presentations we've had in this

329
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
group and everything that's been done

330
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,959
there will go

331
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
on to github

332
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
they continue to meet

333
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,600
on wednesdays typically not necessarily

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
every week but when there's something

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
interesting to discuss and to talk about

336
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
and they're also

337
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
about to reinstate what we had called a

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,560
speaker program which was a program uh

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
where we would invite somebody to

340
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,959
present you know security uh stories

341
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
something interesting a new attack or

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
something related to risk five and

343
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,399
security so that's going to be

344
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
reinstated pretty soon

345
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
the original

346
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
charter for this committee was the one

347
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
that you see here so it's really about

348
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,320
promoting risk 5 as an ig vehicle for

349
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
security for the security community to

350
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
liaise with other internal and external

351
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
um committees so that means not only

352
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,480
with

353
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
other risk five committees that don't do

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
security but also with other

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,279
organizations such as a global platform

356
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
or fido or others like that that have a

357
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,279
security

358
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
as an interest and so there's direct

359
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,600
links between these organizations so

360
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,399
that

361
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,639
people can exchange you know preliminary

362
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,720
versions of specifications make sure we

363
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
don't you know create something in one

364
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
organization that's the opposite to the

365
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,399
other one that would not make any sense

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
so there's a good good discussion going

367
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,639
on there

368
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,560
um and then the other ideas were to

369
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,839
create you know an information

370
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,560
repository for new attacks trends

371
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
counter measures

372
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
list whatever needs to be dealt with in

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
terms of security for risk five and kind

374
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
of get things going

375
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
and so they're pretty much continuing

376
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
this kind of charter and getting more

377
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800
specific on which kinds of security

378
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,240
aspects they want to tackle

379
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
all right

380
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
so there is two task groups as i

381
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
mentioned dedicated to security so here

382
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
you can see a little bit what the

383
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
different task groups are working on the

384
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
first one is the crypto task group and i

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
should probably write that with a k

386
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,399
because the extension is called crypto

387
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
within k

388
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,760
um

389
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
and it is led by richard newell from

390
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
microchip and derek atkins

391
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
um you can see there's a link here and

392
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
you can get the slides afterwards so

393
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
don't write it down um there's a link

394
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
where you can find everything about the

395
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,079
work in progress

396
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,160
they're mainly dealing with isa

397
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,519
extension proposal for scala rv 32 and

398
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
rv 64. um i'm giving you a little bit of

399
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,720
a summary but ben marshall is going to

400
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
give an update on on a big portion of

401
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,199
this a little bit later today so i'm not

402
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
going to deep dive here just telling you

403
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
what's in it

404
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
isis supports accelerates

405
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,519
block ciphers and hash functions uh

406
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,800
there's also

407
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
a raw entropy output output register

408
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,680
that's been discussed with bsi and fibs

409
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,760
and both of them said it's okay to do it

410
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
this way um

411
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,399
there's also boring some instructions

412
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,199
from

413
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
the bitmanip specification and so

414
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
that's one area where this specification

415
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
uses another specification to build on

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
and furthermore there's a second version

417
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,040
of these extensions being worked on

418
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,839
which are vector-based and so there's

419
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,639
more stuff coming up there

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
and then the second task group that we

421
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,199
have dedicated to security there's also

422
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,959
other task groups that are interested in

423
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
security but these ones are dedicated to

424
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,920
security

425
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
uh this one is the te

426
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,639
task group trusted execution environment

427
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
and it's led by nick pacifides from

428
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
fourth uh and paul crew from anders and

429
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
i believe also nick is going to give an

430
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
update a little bit later today about

431
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
everything that's going on in that group

432
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
and all the security activities there so

433
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,240
just as a little bit of a teaser here

434
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
they're working on completing the epmp

435
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,480
and making pushing it through

436
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
ratification process epmb stands for

437
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
enhanced physical memory protection

438
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
and then they're working on additions to

439
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
that or

440
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,000
um other versions of that in the iopmp

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
space the spmp space and so on and a

442
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
bunch of other topics which i'm not

443
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
gonna go into right now that will be

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,399
presenting later on

445
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,480
okay so lots of things going on you can

446
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,959
see very traditional topics and very

447
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,560
cool solutions and there is five worlds

448
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
and then

449
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,519
one more um

450
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,600
thing that i think i can mention here is

451
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
that there are also two special interest

452
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
groups that kind of report directly into

453
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
the security committee that are groups

454
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,440
that don't necessarily write

455
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
specifications but that want to

456
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
need to exist and need to be in charge

457
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,319
of certain aspects of security for which

458
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,839
we need to have

459
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,839
people that are you know accessible that

460
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,679
can answer questions and that you can

461
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,079
send information to so one for example

462
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,880
is

463
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
the security response team this one is

464
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,599
led by don bailey and francis allister

465
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,119
and what this is

466
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,319
um is a team or a sig that is in charge

467
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,880
of setting up a process and dealing with

468
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
security vulnerability disclosure so

469
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
we're not uh expecting to have too many

470
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
of those but you never know

471
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
so in case you find something that you

472
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,440
know is completely broken in one of

473
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
those five specs and you think it's you

474
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
know

475
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
worth saying something about it and

476
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,679
having us

477
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,679
perhaps change that and correct that

478
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
please send an email to this group uh

479
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,200
saying i got a bug i got a security bug

480
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
and it better be fixed

481
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
so we do have this

482
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
security vulnerability disclosure

483
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,600
process in place we've already received

484
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
one such disclosure a few months ago

485
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
which has now been

486
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,919
i believe published at um

487
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,080
stefcon or

488
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
for the other one

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,919
anyway it was in august so very recently

490
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
that was very interesting and so there's

491
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
discussions about how we will fix the

492
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
spec to make sure that's not going to

493
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
have too much of an impact

494
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
that group is working with a company or

495
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
organization i should say called hacker

496
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
one they have a platform solution to run

497
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,039
these processes

498
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,520
uh and so this is where we will having

499
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
uh we will post the specifications for

500
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
people to be able to make comments and

501
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,280
to pick up

502
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
reviews on these things and see if any

503
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,120
you know if you're a hacker that's where

504
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,039
you go to pick up the spec and if you

505
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,559
have a result that's why you post the

506
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,960
result back into the system

507
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
okay and then there's another sig that's

508
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
dedicated to blockchain so this one is

509
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
led by patti tu and gary chu

510
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
and what they were interested in was

511
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,559
creating a group that was um

512
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,400
specifically dealing

513
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,280
with

514
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
how

515
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,039
risk five specs could be optimized for

516
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,799
blockchain applications and by

517
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
blockchain applications we mean on the

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
endpoint mostly

519
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
so they're making recommendations on

520
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,960
additions and extensions to enhance

521
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
performance and to trying to make sure

522
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
that risk 5 is as competitive so to

523
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,039
speak as other

524
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
systems and and specs out there that

525
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,039
might be a blockchain optimized

526
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,440
um a few other things we've done before

527
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
i conclude uh there was an effort to

528
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
launch a fence dot t informal group

529
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
which is a group that would

530
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
try to address micro architectural

531
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
covert channel effects um

532
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
via secure cash management it's a little

533
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
bit hard because it's not on the

534
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,400
priority list really of the cash

535
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,880
management folks so they deal with

536
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
bigger issues so to speak to make it

537
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,080
work first

538
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
and then we come along and say look we'd

539
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
like to make this you know secure secure

540
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
as well so we're kind of a little bit

541
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
later on the list of when it's going to

542
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
happen that this uh this

543
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
solution gets put in place but okay this

544
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
discussion is going on uh somebody

545
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,760
called gernot heiser from data61 had a

546
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,679
solution proposed that he called the

547
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
augmented isa

548
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
um but okay we need to talk more to to

549
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,760
put it in place and then more recently

550
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
someone called suresh supermart joined

551
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
the group and said i would like to

552
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,559
propose to study all sorts of other

553
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
security topics that are not

554
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,520
specifically being addressed or for for

555
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
which there is no specific specification

556
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,559
yet

557
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,120
uh for example control floor integrity

558
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
partner safety secure boot confidential

559
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
computing requirements all of these

560
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
things so there's a bunch of topics that

561
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,120
we all want to address

562
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
uh it takes time but things have started

563
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,159
and i think nick will talk a little bit

564
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,000
more about some of these as well because

565
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
the tt group is picking some of these up

566
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
already

567
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,440
but

568
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
yeah so we need a lot of people to help

569
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,919
there's so many topics to deal with

570
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,799
hopefully this will have uh interest to

571
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
you to the point that you'd like to join

572
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,799
if you're not good yet member and if you

573
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
are already a member please sign up to

574
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,360
the security groups and help us get

575
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,559
things done

576
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,200
so with that i think i'm probably almost

577
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
out of time i am at my last slide yes

578
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
thank you very much

579
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,480
and don't forget the other talks after

580
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
this one that will go into all the

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
details of what we just talked about

582
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
thank you

583
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,679
that's great thanks a lot helena um

584
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,600
so i guess we have a few minutes for

585
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,880
questions if there are any um

586
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
like i said at the start if you

587
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
raise your hand i can see that in the

588
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
participants list and maybe i can prompt

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
you to speak it out if you want to or if

590
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,760
you prefer

591
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
um

592
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
pastes a question in the chat and i'll

593
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,799
try to sort of cherry pick some and read

594
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
those out myself

595
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
i think i'm seeing one in the chat

596
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
okay that makes my life easier already

597
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
okay let me go and let me go and answer

598
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
that one uh the question is can you tell

599
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
more on the status of confidential

600
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
computing and secure boots

601
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
so secure boot is a notion that had been

602
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
um

603
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
put on the list on the to-do list by the

604
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,039
te task group early on so they had uh

605
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,440
started writing a specific specification

606
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,640
about it

607
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
and then we realized that doing too many

608
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
things at the same time wouldn't get us

609
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
anywhere any anytime soon so they

610
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
started

611
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
by first doing epmp io pmps and so on

612
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
and then after that's done and nick can

613
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
tell me more about that after that's

614
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
done uh that topic will get picked up

615
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
again so it's about writing a

616
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,400
specification of how to do it correctly

617
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
and making sure that all of the

618
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
necessary hooks and elements are in the

619
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,919
existing specs so that you can actually

620
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
boot up securely with risk five

621
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,559
and confidential computing i think is a

622
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,760
more recent notion this is really about

623
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,640
uh making encrypted islands making sure

624
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
that you know some of your

625
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,039
vms in your systems are encrypted

626
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,000
correctly and are uh private to what

627
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
you're trying to do so this is a notion

628
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,960
that is um that sets out requirements

629
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
and now we need to start looking within

630
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
risk five what that means on a risk five

631
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
for risk five based system so do we have

632
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
all the necessary elements in the specs

633
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
that would allow us to do that and if

634
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
not we need to create new specs to do it

635
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,000
so it's the beginning only

636
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
so both topics are bigger than te groups

637
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
the secure boot yes the confidential

638
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
computing has been mentioned but i don't

639
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,520
know how it's been split across groups

640
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
right now so maybe we will so so hi

641
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
hello it's sandy dello i'm the new chair

642
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
of the security hc um just a quick

643
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
update from me the

644
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,640
the secure boot um we discussed setting

645
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
up a working group a working team

646
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,559
rather ahead of a working group to

647
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
create a security model for risk five

648
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
there are a few volunteers um who put

649
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
themselves forward to help and do that

650
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,039
work we're very

651
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,880
keen that more people join

652
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,600
so muhammad if you're interested in in

653
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,360
assisting in that effort then yeah we're

654
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
going to create a security model which

655
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
will include things like security

656
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,440
station

657
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
great thanks andy

658
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
so i i'll also

659
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
nick here so um

660
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
some some issues we had with secure boot

661
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
was that uh because on risk 5 we're

662
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
trying to cover a large large range of

663
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
use cases

664
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,440
uh there are uh

665
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
there are vendors that believe that um

666
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
for example we

667
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
using asymmetric crypto for signature

668
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
checking is not

669
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,640
uh is not possible in some

670
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,520
some

671
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,679
implementations so

672
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
there was a point that we couldn't

673
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
even agree on what a signature is and we

674
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
were trying to

675
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
find you know the best uh best approach

676
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,480
that would fit most people

677
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
and in the end the secure boot ended up

678
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
being mostly a software thing

679
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
and uh there are already standards out

680
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
there there are already people trying to

681
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,360
do it there are multiple open source

682
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
projects and proprietary projects that

683
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,039
have already done secure boot on risk

684
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,400
five so we we focused on uh adding the

685
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
hardware

686
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
bits there that would assist in secure

687
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
boots and then discussing about the

688
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,799
software aspect of it but as

689
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,919
andrew said now we are restarting this

690
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,840
but the thing is that the challenge is i

691
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
guess to not reinvent the wheel

692
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
to not do yet another secure boot

693
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,760
specification

694
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
uh and just

695
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
provide the necessary

696
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
mechanisms so that any secure boot

697
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
implementation software wise can work on

698
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,879
respite

699
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,190
and

700
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,480
[Music]

701
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
they'll be your talk a bit later on

702
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
still

703
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
okay that's the end of my talk

704
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,440
great yeah if there's nothing else let's

705
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,240
leave it there thanks helena and move on

706
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,279
to the next

707
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,200
next talk

708
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
um

709
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
so yeah the next talk is by uh

710
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
ben marshall who

711
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
is a researcher at the university of

712
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,919
bristol and an engineer at pq shields

713
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,200
and as selena suggested he's the editor

714
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,799
of the risk five

715
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,559
cryptography extension

716
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,960
um which i guess very neatly summarizes

717
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,159
what the what the talk is about

718
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,840
essentially

719
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,879
so ben over to you

720
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
unmute excellent good okay you can all

721
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,279
hear me right

722
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,159
yes

723
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,080
wonderful the the joy of having zoom on

724
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,240
two monitors is that now i can see what

725
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,679
i'm presenting but i can't see any of

726
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,480
you

727
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
um so yeah the fun continues anyway

728
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
thank you for the introduction um yeah

729
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,039
so my talk um is about the the rest five

730
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,279
cryptography extensions that helena um

731
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,440
sort of introduced very happily in her

732
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,159
talk um and like like dan said i i while

733
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,919
i don't have any official capacity

734
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
within the risk life cryptography task

735
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
group i'm the sort of de facto editor of

736
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,240
the standard um what that exactly means

737
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
is that i do a lot of writing

738
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,440
um but it does mean that also i can give

739
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
you a pretty good overview of things um

740
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
so yeah i'm here representing the the

741
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
task group and what i want to go through

742
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,640
is basically um what the cryptography

743
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,039
task group has done so far and sort of

744
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,559
explains for the rationale about why

745
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,159
we've done what we've done and the order

746
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,440
we've done it in

747
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
i'll give you a little overview of the

748
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,039
the scalar cryptography extension which

749
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,600
is now frozen as of maybe a week ago now

750
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,120
so it's very sort of very hot off the

751
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
press

752
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,279
um

753
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
and you know something worth everyone

754
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,240
knowing about i think

755
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,679
and then sort of plans for what we want

756
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,919
to do in the future and how you can all

757
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,000
get started because as helena kind of

758
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
mentioned i'm actually getting started

759
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
with the sky of just navigating all the

760
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,000
different groups is very difficult but

761
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,799
i'm really glad
