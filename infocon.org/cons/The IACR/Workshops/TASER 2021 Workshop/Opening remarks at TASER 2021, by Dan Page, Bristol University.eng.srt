1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
the sort of opening and closing so

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,319
welcome to the first topics in hardware

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,200
security and risk five or taser workshop

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,280
um i'm not going to subject you to more

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,120
slides or waste any more time than

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,559
necessary but i've got a couple of

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,639
things i sort of uh want to or need to

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,599
say

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,720
initially

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,680
um

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
just for some context the original idea

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
to hold this uh really came from

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
benedict and elena

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
the motivation was essentially that

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,960
seems like there's an increasing

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,679
interest in risk five within chess um so

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,680
using risk five as a platform in papers

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
that you see up here at chess

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,880
um for instance there's a sort of

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
resurgence in instruction set extension

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,239
type work

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,480
um but also there's a chance to sort of

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
establish risk five as an explicit topic

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
of interests

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
um and sort of give hardware security

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
using risk fiverr a home a chess going

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,239
forwards

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,800
um they asked richard newell who can't

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,840
be here today and myself to

30
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
help um of course the hardest part was

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,039
coming up with the name i think that

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,520
took about three weeks and 500 or so

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,438
emails so

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,280
whether we did a good job or bad job i

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,640
think by this point we're not so

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,080
bothered

37
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
um

38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
this sort of first edition of the

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,680
workshop is constrained in lots of sort

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
of awkward ways i suppose um the online

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,080
format means probably the scheduling is

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
a bit awkward for some people

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,759
um the time constraints mean that the

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
talk slots are fairly shorts there's not

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
really as much time maybe for

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
interaction and discussion as you would

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
expect in a normal workshop and we don't

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,759
have a break scheduled

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
um and the short lead in time meant that

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,960
we've sort of gone for uh invited talks

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,680
only um i think if there's an appetite

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
to run subsequent versions then

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
obviously these are things that we can

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
try to resolve i think benedict said

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
that there was around 200 registrants

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
um but maybe that's i'm not sure well

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,759
nearly 70 uh on the call at the moment

58
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
so it seems like maybe there is an

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
appetite to do do something

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
in the future as well

61
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,240
um all that said we're really lucky to

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
have uh six great speakers

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
um on topics that span both the sort of

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
ch part of chess so that's the

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
cryptographic hardware and the es or

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
embedded systems part

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
maybe the embedded systems part is sort

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
of

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
less strongly represented in the main

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
chess programme traditionally and so you

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
could argue this is another motivation

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
or niche for the workshop in the future

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,560
due to the sort of time constraints so

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
i'm not going to give any of the

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
speakers any sort of lengthy

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
introduction that is just due to the

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,599
time constraints i'm not

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
hopefully not causing them any

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
disrespect

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
um

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
but as well as thanking the speakers

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
themselves the other sort of obvious

83
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,519
thing to say is to to thank kay uh for

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
the technical help um taser is a chairs

85
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,840
affiliated event which i guess you

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
already saw during the registration

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
process which we share but also the sort

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
of technical side of things is supported

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
as well i think it's fair to say we

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
couldn't do that without that help um

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
even after a year or so of using zoom i

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
still struggle to make it do what i want

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
to as illustrated by the fact i still

94
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,680
can't remember to take myself off mute

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
so hopefully kay can save us from that

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
sort of embarrassment

97
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,360
um because chess is an uh iacr

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
affiliated events the iscr code of

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,280
conduct applies

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,080
um i won't walk through that at all but

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
i'm going to paste the link to the code

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
of contact in the uh chats so i'd

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
encourage you to have a look at that if

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
you haven't seen it um already

105
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
just a reminder that the session has

106
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
been recorded you've probably heard the

107
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
robot zoom lady say that already

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
um

109
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
we'll ask the speakers to share their

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
slide sets if they're willing afterwards

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
and put those on the website for a sort

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
of future reference

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
um

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
and the other thing is that there isn't

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,640
a lot of time budgeted for the q a

116
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
slots after the talks

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,159
i'll try to moderate that and i think

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
the most sensible approach is that if

119
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
you've got a question

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
then you can use the raise hands um

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
button which i think is under the

122
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,640
reactions

123
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
icon on on most zoom interfaces

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
um and i'll prompt you to actually sort

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
of speak your question if you're willing

126
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
to do that if you don't want to do that

127
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
or you prefer not to then if you ask a

128
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,160
question in the chat window and i'll try

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
to sort of cherry pick those or keep

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
track of them as we go through

131
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,080
um

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
i think that's more or less everything

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
covered benedict did you want to say

134
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
anything

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
um no just maybe on the topic of

136
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
questions you know if if it actually

137
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
happens that we get a good discussion

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
and tons of questions going um we can

139
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
always you know

140
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
basically keep the meeting open later at

141
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,880
the end if somebody really wants to

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
discuss something if people are willing

143
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,639
to stick around for longer and discuss

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
on that's fine we don't have to close

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
exactly on the minute

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
yeah good idea

147
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
okay

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
so without further ado then i think we

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,280
can probably get started with the first

150
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,758
talk
