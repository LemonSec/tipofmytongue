1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,889
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I'll

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,960
be talking today about the non spaced

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,270
and hence trashed and mask construction

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,490
which I've worked on jointly with

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,849
Marilyn Dee and widget data as we all

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:31,500
know both the receiver and the sender

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:34,140
share the same secret key for sharing

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,079
message authentication codes in the

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,620
symmetric key setting here Alice wants

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,379
to send the message I accept Bob and if

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,038
is an active adversary who might change

12
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:52,410
the message before it reaches Bob

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:55,170
however Alice appends attack T to the

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,589
message which she computes using the

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,079
secret key that she and Bob share and

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,729
Bob will only read the message if he can

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:09,360
verify the tag using his copy of the key

18
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:12,210
if it still changes the message then the

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,700
new message may not match the old tag

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:20,939
and Bob will not read it in order to

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,090
carry out a successful forgery and its

22
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:28,229
sorry Eve will play a game with Allison

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,000
Bob she will query make um

24
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:36,240
authentication queries to Alice and

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,350
she'll get back the corresponding tags

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,350
for each message and she will also make

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:46,470
QV verification queries to Bob and he

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,380
will respond by telling her whether or

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,380
not each message tag pair is valid if

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,229
Eve can then make a new and valid

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,719
message tag pair that she sends to Bob

32
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,149
then Bob will not know that this message

33
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:09,840
was tampered with and he will read it so

34
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:12,540
such a such as a forgery we can see an

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,890
example of such a forgery on about the

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:20,510
bound secure Mac here

37
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:24,869
so we have ECBC as an example and this

38
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:27,570
Mac has the expansion property so if the

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,580
tax for two messages collide then the

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,150
tax for any other two messages which

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,550
have the previous two messages as

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,880
prefixes will also collide so you can

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,340
use this property of ECBC and make a

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,490
successful forgery if she finds out that

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:49,020
the tag for the messages I accept and I

46
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,800
reject are the same then she can add the

47
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,690
phrase your paper to her message and

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,380
carry out a successful forgery and Bob

49
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,329
will read the message such collisions

50
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,930
can be found with high probability

51
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,680
within the birthday bomb so if it's an

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,670
n-bit message then approximately 2 power

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,670
n by 2 queries

54
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:18,480
however for smaller message blocks like

55
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:22,049
say 64 bits for which is generally used

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,720
in lightweight cryptography this is not

57
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,450
sufficient because as we can see ECBC is

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,600
secured only up to 2 power 25 queries

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,660
and PMAC can be attacked in just 2 power

60
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:39,019
18 queries so this is a serious data

61
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,020
constraint and we need higher security

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,649
Redmond Carter Mac is a Mac that gives

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,120
quite a better security as compared to

64
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:55,320
ECBC it uses a nonce input along with

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,040
the message to compute the tag and as we

66
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,260
can see it has it is secured up to

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,739
approximately 2 power 54 queries so

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,070
that's quite an improvement however if

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,060
the nonce is misused even once I mean if

70
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,769
the noise is repeated even once then it

71
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,959
is completely insecure this construction

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,900
is completely insecure so we need in

73
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,620
cases where such repetitions cannot be

74
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,169
controlled for example if the size of

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,870
the nonce

76
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,450
small or if the nonsense reset for some

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,660
reason then we need at least some

78
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,430
security so we need constructions that

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,500
not only give beyond birthday bond

80
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,390
security in the non suspecting setting

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,500
but also some security in the nonce

82
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:47,110
misusing setting for example the

83
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,870
encrypted Venkman Carter with Davis

84
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:54,280
mayor construction that was proposed by

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,950
Cogley IT and siren is a Mac it is again

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,200
a non space Mac and it has beyond

87
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,170
birthday bond security in when the nonce

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,849
is respected and birthday bond security

89
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:08,860
when the nonce is misused the decrypted

90
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,440
Ragman Carter with Davis mirror which

91
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,190
was proposed by the title is another

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:23,940
construction that has the similar

93
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:28,420
security situation but again these tools

94
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:31,140
Mac's also suffer from a birthday bond

95
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,820
security when the nonce is misused and

96
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,039
for similar reasons as in the non

97
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,409
suspecting settings that I mentioned we

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,410
don't need beyond birthday bond security

99
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,830
at least up to a certain level even when

100
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,140
the nonce is misused so we have proposed

101
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,270
a construction that not only gives

102
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,990
beyond birthday bond security when Nance

103
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,729
is respected but also gives gracefully

104
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,540
degrade in security when the nonce is

105
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,780
misused this means that just a few

106
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,880
instances of nonce misuse would not

107
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,349
really cause the security to go down to

108
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,469
the birthday bound maybe after a lot of

109
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:14,650
repetitions are made but not immediately

110
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:16,810
for this we introduce a concept which is

111
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,659
similar to multi-collision in nonsense

112
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,040
but it's slightly weaker than that which

113
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,380
we call faulty nonces and we use two

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,340
tools a theorem on the multi-collision

115
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,890
of hash values of messages and an

116
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,929
extended version of mirror theory for

117
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,669
which we give a proof I'll beg for a

118
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,100
weaker bound than the one provided by

119
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,930
patterning and

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,490
[Music]

121
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,530
we also have demonstrated an application

122
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,930
of our Mac in an authenticated

123
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,039
encryption scheme which is based on the

124
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,129
CWC

125
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:59,500
II so this is our construction which we

126
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:02,259
call nonce based and hence hashed in

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,050
mask as we can see it is very similar to

128
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:07,330
the enhanced hashed and mask

129
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,909
construction proposed by minimott so the

130
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,490
only differences are that ours is a

131
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,919
single kid version it has it is nonce

132
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:22,659
based instead of using random salts and

133
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:26,198
it has a domain separation involved as I

134
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,819
have already mentioned any HTM is secure

135
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,650
roughly up to 2 power n by 3

136
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,419
authentication queries into parent

137
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,409
verification queries when the nonce is

138
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:38,229
respected and its security degrades

139
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:42,279
gracefully when the nonce is misused in

140
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:45,520
fact this degradation is linear so when

141
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,339
the number of faulty nonces which here

142
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,609
we are denoting by mu becomes pretty

143
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:54,879
much equal to the number of

144
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:57,129
authentication queries qm only then does

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,759
the security fall down to the birthday

146
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:04,330
ball but if let's say a constant number

147
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:10,259
of faulty nonces are present then it

148
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:15,250
won't affect the security that much also

149
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:20,199
this is the definition of 14 ounces so

150
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:22,599
if we have unknowns that if if we have a

151
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,180
query that has a nonce value which is

152
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,719
equal to the to the value of an on stack

153
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,900
has already been queried earlier then

154
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:37,169
that nonce is called a faulty nodes so

155
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:43,689
for example in this case oh sorry

156
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:45,970
so in this case all the five nonce

157
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,149
values and one and two and three and

158
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,700
four and five they are they count as

159
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:54,610
five multi-collision in nonce

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,710
however if we come faulty nonsense then

161
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,710
n1 is not a faulty non since it is a

162
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,600
fresh value whereas n two and three and

163
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,600
four and five they are all faulty nonces

164
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,610
in this case n1 and n3 do not count as

165
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,979
faulty nonces whereas they are included

166
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,400
in mighty collisions another point

167
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,640
another difference of faulty nonces from

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,840
multi collisions is that this

169
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,819
constitutes a two multi condition and

170
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,030
this constitutes a four mighty collision

171
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,610
where as we count all the faulty nonces

172
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,189
together and so n2 and four and five and

173
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:40,270
six together constitute for fault

174
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:42,730
analysis we prove the security of a

175
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,640
construction using the expectation

176
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,210
method that was introduced by huang in

177
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,970
Tercero

178
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,690
and this is a generalization of the

179
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,460
coefficients edge technique and we use

180
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,550
the two tools that I have already

181
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,100
mentioned the rebound the number of

182
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,339
multi collisions of hash values of

183
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:08,520
messages using a theorem that we that I

184
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:12,370
shall shortly be presenting and we also

185
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:17,110
give an extended version of myriad

186
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:22,900
theory for which we provide a proof

187
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,790
partial proof diluted proof so a first

188
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:29,110
tool is the multi-collision theorem

189
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:32,290
which gives a bound on the minimum

190
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,390
probability of getting a I plus 1

191
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,110
multi-collision x' in hash values

192
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,080
amongst q messages where we have an

193
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,810
epsilon universal hash function and it

194
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,120
can be proved this theorem can be proved

195
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,650
using the Union bound and thus counting

196
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:55,390
lemma furthermore this lemma can be

197
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:57,819
proved by so this okay the statement of

198
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,460
this lemma is that if we are given a

199
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:06,490
vertex set of a particular size and

200
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,620
we construct a graph by adding edges

201
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,089
such that the number of edges is more

202
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,270
than this value

203
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:18,440
q square upon ceiling of Q square upon 2

204
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:21,770
zai then we will certainly get at least

205
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,839
one edge between two vertices in any

206
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:28,880
collection of Cypress 1 vertices that we

207
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:33,140
choose so your the proof is quite simple

208
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,959
we divide all the Q vertices into size

209
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,620
of collections of cuba's I ceiling of

210
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,930
cuba's I vertices each the last set may

211
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:46,430
contain last collection may contain less

212
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:50,209
overt Isis and we add edges such that

213
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:54,770
each collection becomes a clique and no

214
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:59,959
two vertices in different cliques share

215
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:03,050
any edge so if we choose one vertex out

216
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:05,599
of each collection then we have chosen a

217
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,219
total of 0 Tice's and since we want to

218
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,930
choose I plus 1 vertices there has to be

219
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,390
we can choose what s is in any other way

220
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,349
also but that way certainly

221
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:20,779
ensure an edge between two vertices and

222
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,320
even if we choose it in this way so

223
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,170
basically by the pigeonhole principle we

224
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:31,610
definitely have at least one pair of

225
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:35,209
vertices that share an edge so that's

226
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,400
how we prove this lemma the next tool

227
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:41,089
that we have used is an extended version

228
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:45,439
of mirror theory so for that we first

229
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:48,380
define the system of equations induced

230
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,959
by an edge labelled graph as we can see

231
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,650
here we have a graph that has labels on

232
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,829
its edges and we assume the vertices of

233
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,870
the graph to denote the variables of the

234
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:03,680
equations and whenever a pair of

235
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:07,550
vertices is connected by an edge then it

236
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,800
is it induces the equation in this way

237
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,140
so there are two if y 1 and y 2 our

238
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,270
vertices connected by an edge then we

239
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:20,490
have the equation y 1 plus y 2 is

240
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:22,890
equal to lambda1 - and then we define an

241
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,620
injective solution to a system of

242
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,830
equations that is induced by a graph in

243
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:33,660
this way to basically be a solution for

244
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:35,820
all these vertices such that the system

245
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,790
of the solution is consistent with all

246
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,130
the equations we can extend this concept

247
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,240
to involve non equations as well so for

248
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:48,990
example the vertices y 5 and y 6 induce

249
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,620
a non equation by five this five six is

250
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,990
not equal to lambda one three and we can

251
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,779
extend the definition of injective

252
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:05,250
solutions to include these non equations

253
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:08,880
also so it is pretty much clear that

254
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:12,270
there can exist graphs that only induce

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,100
that have that induce equations and non

256
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,790
equations that only have inconsistent

257
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:21,300
solutions or that have equations that

258
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:24,420
give redundant information and such

259
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,819
things so we need to define what are

260
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,000
good graphs so this is an example of a

261
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:34,440
good graph a good graph cannot have

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,010
cycles that are that consist of edges

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,320
that only induce equations because such

264
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,890
a cycle will either give us an

265
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,890
inconsistent solution or it will give us

266
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,709
redundant information depending upon

267
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:55,380
whatever the labels of its edges are a

268
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:59,609
good graph cannot have parts with edges

269
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:03,029
that induce equations and whose edge

270
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,160
labels sum to 0 because then such a path

271
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:09,240
will basically become a cycle and the

272
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,779
same problem will occur a good graph can

273
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,560
also not have cycles with exactly one

274
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:21,480
edge inducing non equations such that

275
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,869
the sum of its edge labels is 0 so here

276
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,660
if lambda 2 prime were to become 0 then

277
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,560
the sum of then it would force the sum

278
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,400
of these two what

279
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,959
Isis to be equal to to be equal to

280
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,550
lambda 2 prime whereas this is a non

281
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,750
equation so I don't want these two to

282
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:45,420
sum to lambda 2 prime so the two

283
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,570
conditions for two requirements for a

284
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,490
graph to be a good graph is that it

285
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,260
should have consistent solutions and

286
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,690
there should be no redundancy or

287
00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:00,180
degeneracy this can be ensured by these

288
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,990
three conditions that we abbreviate to

289
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:09,180
NC no cycle and PL nonzero path level

290
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:12,210
and NCL non zero cycle label so if G is

291
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,120
such a good graph with alpha vertices

292
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,520
out of which QM vertices are involved in

293
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,310
equations and QV vertices are involved

294
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,089
in non equations then the minimum number

295
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:26,040
of solute injective solutions to the

296
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,870
systems of equations and non equations

297
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:34,469
that G induces we have proved it to be

298
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,930
this number and we can see that this

299
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,080
bound is actually weaker than the one

300
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,540
provided by pecker in his result was to

301
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,240
power n permute alpha over 2 power and Q

302
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,650
and it did it only involved equations

303
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,270
we're now ready to prove the security of

304
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:56,370
any HDL so we do that by bounding the

305
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,319
number of injective solutions to the

306
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,890
system of equations in non equations

307
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,390
that are obtained respectively through

308
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:10,650
the authentication and verification

309
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,449
queries that an adversary makes and we

310
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,400
use the two two tools multi-collision

311
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,929
theorem and Miller theory for bounding

312
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,600
the probabilities of the good in bad

313
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:22,410
transcripts so this is how we get the

314
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,678
authentication equations and

315
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:29,970
verification non equations and we can

316
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:34,020
certainly construct a graph to we can

317
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,540
certainly construct the graph 2 which

318
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,780
induces these equations and these are

319
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,240
the bad events whose probabilities are

320
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,330
bounded by these four

321
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,920
duties and in particular the even b3

322
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,350
requires use of the multi-collision

323
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,940
theorem that we saw earlier the

324
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,159
remaining equations and non equations

325
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:58,220
can then be bounded using our version of

326
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:01,559
the mirror theory result finally we

327
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:05,610
demonstrate our a scheme which is based

328
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:08,129
on the CWC construction this has a

329
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:11,580
privacy beyond birthday bond privacy

330
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:15,750
however its authenticity is broken on

331
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:18,059
nonce misuse whereas our construction it

332
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,210
has beyond boredom on privacy as well as

333
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:25,070
beyond birthday bond authenticity which

334
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:27,750
gracefully degrades or nonce misuse and

335
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:32,629
to conclude these are all the things

336
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,630
that I have discussed and thank you

337
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:54,280
any questions what do you need the

338
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,889
domain separation for do you need it

339
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,740
just for technically for for your proof

340
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:03,130
or would there be an attack if you don't

341
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,700
have to main separation no actually we

342
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,549
would like we would we like to have a

343
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,289
single kid version of each team and that

344
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:18,610
that's why we use the domain separation

345
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:22,600
it wouldn't affect the proof so much any

346
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,770
more questions so maybe a mr. where can

347
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,240
you say something about the tightness of

348
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:51,520
the bound is it clear that they are

349
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:55,530
tight or just if you know for matching

350
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,150
attack so if you don't know it's okay so

351
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:02,500
we have a clear but the bound attack

352
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:04,000
when the nonce is misused right I'm not

353
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:17,100
so sure about the tightness right now

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:19,420
maybe I sorry any more questions okay so

355
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,299
not let's take the speaker again

356
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,299
