1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,020
and thanks for the introduction and into

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,879
my talk is about robust action scheme

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,960
and they said join the work with search

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,039
for okay so first of all what is the

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,180
question scheme and so as actually I'm

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,189
interpreting of the form a talk and it

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,420
also says that about secretion scheme

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,640
and the TC is not a very rigid version

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,030
of the second scheme and we just use it

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,890
because for for for convenience

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,050
okay so first for second shell scheme

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,960
and actually we want a second share

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,209
secret my end parties and so there are

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,379
two parameters way is the for the

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,780
privacy and we hope that n a tea parties

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,210
cannot learn anything about s because

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,510
there may be some corrupted party inside

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,010
and another feature is the

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,620
reconstruction and we will hope that and

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,260
and our parties can recount completed

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,239
recover the secret this is the our

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,689
definition for the secretion scheme and

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:11,360
so the other we said the celebrated

24
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:14,189
samia's equation scheme to realize our

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,710
realizes the second shot scheme and so

26
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,199
how to do that and imagine that so we

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,048
have a second s and we just pick the

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,259
random degree polynomial effects and the

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,180
letter F 0 equals s for each party and

30
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,689
here we get an evaluation of this

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:35,009
polynomial at some point for example si

32
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,809
equals Fri and so by very simple like

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,900
round interpolation we can show that

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,600
actually it was it has T privacy and the

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,700
T possible reconstruction and so we also

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,179
call it a threshold secretion scheme and

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,630
this is and so what is the robust

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,630
efficient scheme and besides the privacy

39
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,339
and reconstruction we have another

40
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,670
feature for this equation scheme and

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,229
that means that first we imagine that

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,630
this equation schema we have owner

43
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,850
stealer and owners Reconstructor the

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,770
dealer will distribute the shares among

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,810
the parties and the tree constructor

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,209
will collect the shares and reconstruct

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,190
the secret however because we know there

48
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,500
are some

49
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,690
the party and the discord party he care

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,940
corrupt his shares and he uh not

51
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:25,100
honestly and report his share so that in

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,890
this case so assume that we have a tea

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,210
core of the party and yeah indeed you

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,549
know you know outsider we assume that

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,470
the first key is corrupted and so these

56
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,730
two parties are the shares are not

57
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,859
corrected and then yeah in this case we

58
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,660
still care robustly reconstruct

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,760
reconstruct security with high

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,490
probability and the proper error

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,620
probability is very small exponentially

62
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:54,080
small so we call it the real persecution

63
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,600
scheme okay so you know in your paper

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,600
and we considered this this adversity

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,730
model and rushing at the Weslie model

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,579
and so what is the russian anniversary

67
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,130
the russian diversity and actually he's

68
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,980
more powerful and because you know

69
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,170
during the reconstruction face and

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,179
everyone who have every party he had to

71
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,910
stand back and his share to a

72
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,670
Reconstructor but however the adversary

73
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,620
and he can show maybe for example tea

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,899
parties and he will delay his

75
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,080
transmission and to his so all others

76
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,330
share and then he is depends on the

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,120
shares of the honest party and in this

78
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,190
case we call it a russian adversary yeah

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,540
actually it's quite powerful and there's

80
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,790
also not rushing at the bursary

81
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,829
knowledge at the mercy means that he

82
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,820
don't have this power and his decision

83
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:46,720
is completely determined by by his cheek

84
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:50,810
or party he can only can see his share

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:54,050
so this is not rushing to adversely okay

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,570
so they had some yes some results and

87
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,480
also some previous works in this area

88
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,480
and i just listed some of them because

89
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,179
there are many many results and just

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,850
this these results are more relevant and

91
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,720
so yeah so there are actually there are

92
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:15,200
several and there are two performance we

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,209
can compare we can mmm we can do

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,700
comparison and the first is the share

95
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,140
and you know the smaller the share is

96
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,580
that the better the performance it would

97
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,289
be and so first of the M is the

98
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,780
Emily the circular sighs and n is the

99
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,449
number of palais party and the kappa is

100
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,059
the security parameter you see in this

101
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,009
paper we achieve we actually we have to

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,259
result when result is that which

103
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,840
achieved optimal of open your share size

104
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,120
and also the russian adversary is no

105
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,820
more I mean it's much stronger the

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,889
Russian model and but indeed this result

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,800
is not running in polynomial time it's

108
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,350
running super polynomial time so it's an

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,210
another result is running polynomial

110
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,030
time but it's not optimal sheer size and

111
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,669
achieve some N and n to the epsilon

112
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,190
epsilon is a very you can't be any small

113
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,159
constant okay so there are two risotto

114
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:10,190
we can compare with and the one without

115
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,410
the frost cfor to our paper and they

116
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,780
actually Oh n plus Kappa because this is

117
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,910
the Russia at the bursary so we have in

118
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,049
the same atoms in model but their sheer

119
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,770
size is much bigger

120
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,930
it's a n level and and so and there

121
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,758
another paper is 16th Europe group

122
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,490
sixteenth paper and they actually

123
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,639
achieved the optimum sheer size however

124
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,910
and it's another it's not a rushing

125
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,710
advisory oh by the way besides I mean we

126
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,510
all all this result at least all this

127
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,180
result are listed they achieved a

128
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:44,240
maximum corruption means that the the

129
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,639
adversary is only one less than also at

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,699
the corrupted party the only one less

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,889
than the honest party so yeah this is

132
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:56,030
the maximum corruption and it's most

133
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:59,389
difficult as from situation to handle

134
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,780
okay so let's compare and do some come

135
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,430
yeah

136
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,729
yes there are some differences between

137
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,030
our schema skimming the a paper inst

138
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,729
your crippled sixteens paper so actually

139
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,099
oh yeah we also pour some idea from

140
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,349
their paper and they are to two things

141
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:19,820
kind of things are seen and the first of

142
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:24,770
first we consider the pairwise education

143
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:27,199
so that issue and when partied on he not

144
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,229
only I mean she and hold a share of the

145
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,880
sacred also he do some verification for

146
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,130
the other party so make sure that other

147
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,779
party is not corrupted if if it's

148
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,430
corrupted and you are honest party you

149
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,820
can find his corruption

150
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,100
these kind of settings and also and and

151
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,980
of course if we verify all the enema

152
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,890
other parties and the other side will go

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,540
close to n so it's too big so we use a

154
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,880
random verification of graph to reduce

155
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,030
the sheer size of course there are some

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,980
difference first of all I mean because

157
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,380
they use the Russian diversity model and

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,960
we already demoed is not Russia

159
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,540
diversity models so so they actually

160
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,479
they can do more things like first of

161
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,090
all the you city or they authenticate

162
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,500
the share BIOS and authentication code

163
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,729
and so they also authenticated keys and

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,270
pertaining Russian world oh it's it's

165
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,890
nothing we cannot do that and because in

166
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,650
this case and the delimit ability of

167
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,630
adversely lying about a key and also but

168
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,229
however it's yeah it's - in the russia

169
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,630
to model the task in turn to work yeah

170
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,670
also but in our work i mean we only

171
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,370
authenticated some part of the shares

172
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:40,370
instead of the whole shares and it makes

173
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,940
so we we keep ours or sanitation key

174
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,270
secret so yes but it makes problem more

175
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:51,950
difficult okay so actually there are

176
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:54,770
some building blocks you know you know

177
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,200
paper and this one is we introduced to

178
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,090
introduce the list decodable codes in

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,650
our construction and this is also

180
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,229
different the frontier construction they

181
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:06,260
don't have this in this building blocks

182
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,210
and it's a very nice we actually we use

183
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,349
the 40° own code it has very nice

184
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,750
property attack a correct up to m e 1

185
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,450
minus R minus EPSA 2 n errors but also

186
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,000
the list size are very small you know

187
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,460
actually our paper we have two different

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,430
settings for EPS you know first I think

189
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,799
you so V is a constant and the setting

190
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,230
option is actually here's over over

191
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,790
login and so because they serve over log

192
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,020
n so it will output

193
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,730
live exponential size and so and not a

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,610
super polynomial second sorry it's not

195
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:44,060
exponential size but that's why we got

196
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,860
two different result of solutions and

197
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,219
when solution has a super polynomial

198
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,020
because of our list according accords

199
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,350
okay so actually I thought the eyes are

200
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,079
very

201
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,150
crazy graph and yeah we every party he

202
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,630
need to verify the other some small set

203
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,189
of other parties and so that if we he's

204
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,320
honest and he will provide some

205
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,870
information whether the other party is

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,420
corrupted or not however of course we

207
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,460
don't know if he's honest or not because

208
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,920
they the if it's called party he could

209
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,380
also disguise that he's honest or he

210
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,740
would do some other strategy too but

211
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,500
anyway I mean it's so so this is very

212
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,180
important and because we because the

213
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,400
honest party is also always be the

214
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,959
majority win so we have some kind of

215
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,390
mechanism to do to check whether he's on

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,300
his own honest on not a hundred percent

217
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,800
sure but yeah with some probability or

218
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,839
do something okay so yeah this is our

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,420
encoding scheme and the first of all we

220
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,030
go we get a separate s and we encoded by

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,160
the photo resume code and using the

222
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,189
verification random vertical graph to

223
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,290
add some authentication tags and keys to

224
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,130
the Shearer and the fur and and at the

225
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:00,199
end we included the tag at the tag is

226
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,870
stored robustly and acropole so everyone

227
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,900
can learned you know the tag but he if

228
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,130
he corrupt the tag it makes it makes no

229
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,260
it makes no sense

230
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,420
I returned helpful because we store the

231
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,000
tag robust early but we also had to

232
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,459
sacrifice some privacy of the tagger so

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,980
to tag it and down to everyone but yeah

234
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,340
if we corrupt it we can recover it yeah

235
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,940
with high probability so yeah so this

236
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,560
years everyone get yeah and so our

237
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,800
reconstruction scheme actually we're

238
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,939
reconstruction because we say that it's

239
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,430
just the you know I was setting at

240
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,100
Russia anniversary model I mean the

241
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,739
adversity if we only send your share to

242
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,110
reconstruct in one round and the

243
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,360
redstone and adversary can learn

244
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,760
anything about honest party so yeah it's

245
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,780
not safe so we separated it into three

246
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,970
round then yeah this so we first we

247
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,400
transmission paths are sent back out of

248
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,320
the share and then we use some algorithm

249
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,449
and and actually in your paper we

250
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,730
defined there's some passive corrupted

251
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,000
party and the passive party and we just

252
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,470
see I'm Susi for the passive party he

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,629
the number of passivity is bigger or

254
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:12,319
small and we have two different Road

255
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:15,050
route to find it corrected separator to

256
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:16,819
reconstruct the Segway and this is a

257
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,550
very key import very important you know

258
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:21,979
analysis we were we divided the owners

259
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,050
dishonest party into two types one is

260
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,129
the unpassable party and otherwise the

261
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:30,949
active party okay so let's see some of

262
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:33,980
the from the verification graph we can

263
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:37,459
we have some observation these are very

264
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,949
key to our analysis and first of all if

265
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,449
yeah we first of all we need to find a

266
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,109
passive across the party the peso

267
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,649
chiropody

268
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:48,680
and he he didn't occur if he hid in the

269
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:52,040
craft the si si is just a sec resume

270
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:56,000
coding it's a recent code and he just

271
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,129
Cinco they encoded on we reason for the

272
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
result go to be encoded the sacred so as

273
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,470
I is just a symbol of this for terrorism

274
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,508
code and if we actually corrupted and he

275
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,300
can't grab anything so this is our

276
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,360
definition of of the crop tea party and

277
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,189
then and we have yet some severest

278
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,899
observation first is the passive party

279
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:17,540
and honest party they can all pass so

280
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,579
very few of the honest parties because

281
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,439
of this property and the second is an

282
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:23,479
active part if you're active karate

283
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:26,540
party you cannot pass the word sketchy

284
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,309
of Lana's party and the last is also

285
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,870
very important that its distribution of

286
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,170
honest party neighbors are uniform at

287
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,529
random so that means if a diversity he

288
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,569
did when he when he decided which party

289
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,059
is honest a passive one what she is

290
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,339
active one and if he had learns nothing

291
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:45,230
about its distribution of the honest

292
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,120
parties neighbors and so because we

293
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,410
separately into soon round and so we

294
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,779
made we can make it happen okay so there

295
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,930
are two settings first is we assume that

296
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,850
there are many passive parties large so

297
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,550
it appears very large and in this case

298
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,829
so we can use the reason for the reason

299
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,500
code to do reconstruction however this

300
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,000
will output a list of the candidates and

301
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,459
it's not only one but we can make sure

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,920
that correct way is also always in this

303
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,660
list and then we use them with the help

304
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,219
of verification graph we can find it is

305
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,640
correct one out of the mayoral

306
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,880
candidates yeah that's

307
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,090
and so let's go to the small I'm passing

308
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,860
a small pea and the first movie and yeah

309
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,040
actually we have a T plus were honest

310
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,540
party and small well actually it's one

311
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,640
more at least most when was end at

312
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,610
corruptible so if we can we our organs

313
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,500
works for every on his party and we take

314
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,110
a majority vote and we offended at

315
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,390
practice equity so let's assume that we

316
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,000
start from the honest party and the red

317
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,270
one is a red spot is on a crisp pot is

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
honesty one and that the red one is

319
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:57,160
passive one and the black one is active

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,610
so because the red one is always bitter

321
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,530
in the minority so we Chester and the

322
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,870
first step and we start from honest

323
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,089
party and we do verification and all the

324
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,640
honest party and if we said in the

325
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,530
neighbor of this green one and he will

326
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,150
be passed the verification also the

327
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,040
passive one will pass the verification

328
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,310
but to the active one who never passed

329
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,069
the verification then the second around

330
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,140
but they seen some little more subtle

331
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,480
because I mean because they are some

332
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,210
passive when a passive party under the

333
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,630
passive party he can he can led to the

334
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,490
active party passed his verification and

335
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,730
so so that the black when we are joining

336
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,680
the circle and joined the set and also

337
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,450
in other because the green one is honest

338
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,390
well honest one we always bring honest

339
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,880
word and a passive when ye and so so but

340
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:49,990
for the out however organ will make sure

341
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,870
that if we only do it a fourth concern

342
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,410
round and the honest one at the active

343
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:59,410
one and the passive one it is only only

344
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,900
will be the minority was much it will

345
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,880
only account for very small for

346
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,730
approaching of this number of the

347
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,910
proportion in this set so it it won't

348
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,790
affect our analysis so we don't care too

349
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,459
much about it so let's summarize um so

350
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:19,630
so yeah let's do some there are some

351
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,830
conclusion for our algorithm and after I

352
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,080
mean to yet form

353
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:26,650
constant round and the honest party will

354
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,440
be billion and the its orbit as the

355
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,449
majority of the set and per higher but

356
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,170
active at the passive party and the only

357
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,060
account for

358
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,849
square root Epson off the pad a

359
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,739
proportion of the passage so so that and

360
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,570
because it I mean the honest one is the

361
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,390
vast majority and we have some other

362
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,030
algorithm and the asuras and with just

363
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,610
using the probabilistic argument to find

364
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,790
all the honest party and some passive

365
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,940
party but the active party is is less

366
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,949
than the passive party so in this case

367
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,810
because our yeah we included the pirates

368
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,000
encore for the reason color for the

369
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,310
reason code is also a real some code you

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,220
get treated as a ribosome code so they

371
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,469
are very good redundancy and so we can

372
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,070
share we can use some unique decoding

373
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:15,040
algorithm to decoder correctly okay so

374
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,350
this is our to algorithm and we once

375
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,020
have some concluding remarks for our

376
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,240
paper for our result and actually we

377
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,430
poor presented to the prosecution scheme

378
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,680
against a Russian anniversary and yeah

379
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,140
one scheme achieve CSS is a suboptimal

380
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,170
but a run in polynomial time and a

381
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,240
scheming she achieves optimal set but a

382
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,750
running time is exponential because of

383
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,120
the list size so there's a Oban problem

384
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,000
whether we can do it in polynomial size

385
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,390
of do it in polynomial time and also

386
00:16:43,000 --> 00:17:02,500
optimal share sighs this is my talks

387
00:16:46,390 --> 00:17:04,119
thank you any questions so you said that

388
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,520
the read some Solomon code should be

389
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,349
folded can you can you comment on that

390
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,290
why why should it be fold it and what

391
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:16,419
does it mean exactly why did Sonoma

392
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:19,060
Solomon code should be folded so are you

393
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:25,209
using normal Reed Solomon codes or like

394
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:28,119
you said they are folded here lace or

395
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:34,420
because because maybe it may be the

396
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:36,699
stage for so the little it the question

397
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,630
is about the reed-solomon code yeah so

398
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,240
are you

399
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,780
so I said correctly you're not using any

400
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,730
reed-solomon you mean the list size or

401
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,760
this size yeah because this is the

402
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:52,120
me and this is a new result from maybe

403
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,160
eight yeah there are folks eighteen or

404
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,370
fourteen nineteenth paper and by Mary

405
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,530
Reuter and yes I don't remember other

406
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,719
people's name but yeah to me they were

407
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,360
actually very he has a very good result

408
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,360
and that she a constant list size and

409
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,020
also like the size of your so you have a

410
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,659
verification graph yeah tell us about

411
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,639
the number of edges in this oh sorry

412
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,400
yeah it's a very good question

413
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,950
okay so so actually and they are that

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,960
because we have two schemes will scheme

415
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,540
we achieve the optimal size a sheer size

416
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,540
so that the degree of the refugee graph

417
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,879
is log in a local school and also cubic

418
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,639
in I can remember it yeah but but but

419
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,910
this is a poly log n we can see it upon

420
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,350
login and the second another algorithm

421
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,900
and they a channel scheme achieves a

422
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:46,418
chip suboptimal and the the degree is n

423
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,280
to the epsilon R square actually it's to

424
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:51,520
enter the square root epsilon and more

425
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,350
be more precise is that connected to the

426
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,049
parameters for the reed-solomon code or

427
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,649
is it independent actually it's a

428
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,870
connect to our graph algorithm actually

429
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,679
we use the expander graph and so that

430
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,689
the degree of explained graph and its

431
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,970
depth and the larger the degree yes and

432
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,010
I mean so it can expand it's more

433
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,100
quickly so if for the degree is small

434
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:17,410
and expand it more slowly and but but

435
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,780
but but because first of all we need to

436
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,470
consider our algorithm so that we fix

437
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,450
our degree and then and but there'll be

438
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,780
another problem occurs because if we

439
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,120
four degrees if I were to grill you know

440
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,889
expansion graph it's a bigger and it

441
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,370
means that we have we told we cannot

442
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:38,650
have too many a passive party so so and

443
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,449
so it will add a difficulty to our

444
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,040
listing audio chrism and you know a

445
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,169
listicle algorithm we cannot achieve

446
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,899
constant you know epsilon we have

447
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:50,260
achieve over log in Epson or so so so

448
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,600
it's all as resizes or expand as super

449
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,929
super polynomials so yeah this is a

450
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,990
trade-off thank you thank you any more

451
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,990
questions

452
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:04,990
if not then less than the speaker again

453
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,990
[Applause]
