1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,210
so I'm not going through that okay so

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,920
let me show you one picture of the store

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,219
so what we are going to discuss is

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,009
trade-offs between the time and

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,869
approximation factor we can get from

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,460
solving for finding Sharpe vectors in

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,259
ideal lattices I'm going to define

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,840
everything little let me just present to

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,480
us a big picture so if you don't care

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,400
but ideally this is if you want an

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,019
algorithm for any lattice you have the

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,420
Beacon Theatre is I'm on the Left which

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,850
gives you some trade-offs if you

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,969
restrict yourselves to ideal lattices

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,219
you have CDW algorithm which improves

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,320
upon the bkd algorithm in the quantum

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,809
setting and what I want to discuss in

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,420
this talk is kind of an extension of

19
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,610
this DW algorithm where we obtain all

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,739
the trade-offs in the quantum setting

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,320
and some improvement also in the classic

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,480
are sitting and so yeah I should mention

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,309
that the picture on the right is an if

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,538
of Prime peroxide atomic fuel so we can

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,718
extend it to other fields but the

26
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,970
picture is slightly different

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,320
okay so let me start with defining what

28
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,510
I'm going to talk about so that this is

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,270
a vector space is kind of a vector space

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,520
this convictive space of RZ and it's

31
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,679
represented by basis so here's the

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,030
latest in dimension two and the point of

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,830
the latest are integer linear

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,420
combination of the victor of the basis

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,900
so you have an example affinities with

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,390
two different bases okay so sv p stands

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,670
for shortest looked up problem and it's

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,369
a plane given a beta civilities to find

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,619
a shortest non-zero vector of the

40
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,540
lattice and I'm going to write lambda 1

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,479
the akkadian norm of the shortest of the

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,310
shortest vector so I'm going to be

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,250
interested in the approximation variant

44
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,570
of this problem where I just want to

45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,490
find a vector which is at most let's say

46
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,589
for instance two times from that one or

47
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,310
some approximation factor times the

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,130
length of the shortest vector

49
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,780
I'm also going to discuss about cvpcb P

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,360
stands for closest vector problem and

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,479
it's given a target in the real space

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,800
span by geologists we want to find the

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,330
point of the lattice which is the close

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,190
as possible to the target

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,990
and again we have an approximation

56
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,480
variant of this problem where we just

57
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:23,900
want to find a point at some distance of

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:27,239
the target okay so why do we care about

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,070
SVP and CVP analysis it's because when

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,750
you want small approximation factor its

61
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,269
contracted to be hard even in the

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,670
quantum setting and so it can be used to

63
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,680
build cryptographic primitives and so

64
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,239
let me recall you what I've shown in the

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,330
first night so if we want an algorithm

66
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,340
that works for any energies for

67
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,380
arbitrary letís then we have the be the

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,900
best asymptotic algorithm is a bit cagey

69
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,329
algorithm and so what you can have is to

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,430
to Zn approximation factor in polynomial

71
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,590
time or put in the mail approximation

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,920
factor in two to the n time and also

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,770
trade offs in between so now the problem

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,480
if you use SVP and CVP is usually the

75
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,030
schemes that are built on these problems

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,619
are not very efficient in particular

77
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,540
because you have to store a matrix and

78
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,250
things like that and so in order to

79
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,380
improve efficiency we can use structured

80
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,750
lattices and so an example of such

81
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,239
structure that uses our idea reduces so

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm going to define more precisely

83
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,110
what's there in a few slides but let's

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,060
think for a moment as a lattices as

85
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,350
structural matrices and so now the

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,500
question is if we want to do

87
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,390
cryptography on idea lattices then is

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,459
the prime of finding shop victors still

89
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:43,410
hard when we restrict ourselves to idea

90
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:46,019
lattices so this question was partially

91
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,959
absorbed by camel do capital ski at your

92
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,150
crib 2017 and so they showed that in a

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
quantum setting we can do better than

94
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,140
the bkz algorithm we can find to to the

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,660
square root an approximation factor of

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,200
the smallest nonzero vector of the

97
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,510
latest in in putting a malcontent time

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,530
so this is something we don't know how

99
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,929
to do for dinner

100
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,390
general lattices so the algorithm is URI

101
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,590
sticks and it works for pride for us

102
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,279
academic fields and so what I'm going to

103
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:21,539
present in this torque is an extension

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,099
of where so we achieve also trade-offs

105
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,650
in the quantum sitting so there is not

106
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,260
just a drop at to to the square root an

107
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,700
approximation factor and we have some

108
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,789
improvement in the classical setting so

109
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:38,240
again the algorithm is your wrist ik so

110
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:40,590
here is a in the picture sorry for

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,630
foresight Prime from a site redeeming

112
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,119
theaters but it works for any number

113
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,340
field and it's right different and so

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,080
the main difference is that we require a

115
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,750
pre-processing which is exponentially

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,490
large so we are required to first pre

117
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,130
compute something that depends only on

118
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,560
the ring and then this is the query

119
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:04,200
phase of finding shot because in ideal

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,500
in this ring okay so let me already tell

121
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,200
you about the impact of what you should

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:16,160
remember so it's just a theoretical

123
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:18,990
result meaning that ok ok it seems that

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,030
it might be easier to find Shopp vectors

125
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,430
in ideal lattices and in arbitrary

126
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,960
lattices because even I mean even if

127
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,030
with this purpose I think we don't know

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,700
how to do better than the bkz algorithm

129
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,239
in faulty neural lattices but for

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,130
ideology this week we have some

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,080
improvement but it's a pretty absolutely

132
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,750
not a practical algorithm so there are

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,960
two reason for which it I mean it cannot

134
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,120
be used to impact any concrete schemes

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,849
the first one is the exponential

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,590
pre-processing which even if you have to

137
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,500
do it a new one it's still exponential

138
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:56,669
and the second reason is that your ad

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,340
schemes are not so they are shown to be

140
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:02,070
harder to break than breaking the ringer

141
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,140
WB problem which is itself harder to

142
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,390
solve than finding shot Victor's in idea

143
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,940
that uses but we don't have the reverse

144
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,400
direction so it could be that it's easy

145
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,320
to solve to find short vectors in idea

146
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,289
that it is but the ringer W problem

147
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,419
could still be hard to solve so even if

148
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,310
we had a classical polynomial time

149
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,320
algorithm for ideas SGP

150
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,320
this would impact very few cryptographic

151
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,750
schemes ok so let me give you some

152
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,430
details about the algorithm so I'm first

153
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,140
going to define because I'm speaking of

154
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,409
idea lattices so I'm struggling to

155
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,930
define what it is and then I will go to

156
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,219
the stage

157
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,340
okay so for simplicity in this talk I'm

158
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,919
going to restrict myself to a ring which

159
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:52,229
is cyclotomic ring of power of two to

160
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,370
have two secretaries ring so the effects

161
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:58,110
mod X to the n plus one and so I need

162
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,060
two algebraic definition before going

163
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,350
first also units in the ring are

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,210
elements that can be multiplied by

165
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,330
another and amount of the ring so that

166
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,849
the product is one so if you think of Z

167
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,820
the simplest ring may be so you have two

168
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,830
units one and minus one as I am also

169
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,380
going to prison choose the algorithm and

170
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,539
if our principle later so in the turbine

171
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,570
I say ideal I'm just mean in principle I

172
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:25,050
do and this is a set of all multiples of

173
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,940
some element in the ring so again in the

174
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,510
if you look at the set of all even

175
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,719
numbers

176
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:33,150
that's an idea generated by two and we

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,240
know that the generators of an idea

178
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,789
there are exactly the multiples of one

179
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,220
of the trinakha by all the units so in

180
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:45,630
the the general cause of the set of even

181
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,280
numbers are 2 and -2 and that's all so

182
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,760
that's all we are going to need the

183
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,150
algebraic definition so let me tell you

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,889
self define what is a an idea and what

185
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,020
does it mean finding shell vector in an

186
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,500
ideal it means so we are going to see

187
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,200
the ideal as a lattice so it's done for

188
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,240
those of you who note using minkovski

189
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,800
embedding but for simplicity here I'm

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,169
going to present it with a canonical

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,880
embedding sorry coefficient am bidding

192
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,650
so it's a ring are we can see it as a

193
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,930
set of polynomial with integer

194
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,570
coefficient of degree n minus 1 and so

195
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,030
we can see this polynomial of degree n

196
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,039
minus 1 as a vector of dimension n with

197
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,679
integer coefficient and so this gives us

198
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,860
a mapping animalism between the ring and

199
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,799
the N and the N is the lattice I mean

200
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,539
it's a simple it is so here's an example

201
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,669
in dimension 2 so R is Z 2 and now an

202
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,860
ideal is a subset of the ring which is

203
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,920
tabled by addition and subtraction so

204
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,800
its sub lattice of the lattice R and so

205
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,050
we can if we can find the basis of the

206
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,280
idea and we can see it as a lattice

207
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,900
so now I can give you the precise

208
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,319
definition of what I want to do so I'm

209
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,959
given a basis of an idea when I eat the

210
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,150
lettuce and I have some parameter alpha

211
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,580
between 0 and 1 and what I want to do is

212
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,400
to find an element in my ideal which is

213
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,860
done 0 and with a pretty enum is at most

214
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,949
2 to the N to the Alpha times larger

215
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,170
than the smallest element of the idea

216
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,030
and so again we want to do better than

217
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:24,969
the BKG algorithm we want to use the

218
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:27,610
structure of Z that is to do better okay

219
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:33,430
so let me first present choose the CDP

220
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:35,230
algorithm by 2 Kappa 3 yes so I've told

221
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,760
you at the beginning that city the value

222
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,810
algorithm is this - 2 the square root an

223
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,100
approximation factor in quantum put it

224
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,280
in real time so here because I'm

225
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,620
focusing only on principle idea this is

226
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,990
the algorithm CDW is just an extension

227
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:56,110
to any ideas okay so um I'm going to use

228
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,360
a very useful tool for describing this

229
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,820
algorithm and the next one which is the

230
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,820
log function so log with a capital L is

231
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,220
a function that goes from my ring to the

232
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,170
real to the N and you can think of it as

233
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,310
just taking the logarithm of each

234
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,110
coordinate of my vector and so I'm not

235
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,479
going to define one this is a vector

236
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,800
with a new one coordinate and H it's the

237
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,380
I per plane orthogonal to one so I'm

238
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,420
going to give you some properties about

239
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,080
this value will have to trust me and

240
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,180
some are more natural than others so

241
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,740
whenever I take an element in my ring

242
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,410
and I consider it slug I am going to

243
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,490
decompose it as some vector calling out

244
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,949
1 and some vector in the space capital H

245
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,170
so now if I'm looking at diamonds the

246
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:49,810
logarithm of the amount of my ring they

247
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:52,589
are all the own are on health space so

248
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,930
here on the top right part of the line

249
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:58,120
so this is something I mean this is a

250
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,310
property first property the second

251
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,770
property is the elements that are on H

252
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,489
we know them that's unit so also you

253
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:09,420
need some on age and order in

254
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,800
of an HR units and it's not just random

255
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,410
said it's Alexis

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,359
so which is called to log unit cities so

257
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:20,490
when I take the logarithm of the units I

258
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,200
get Alexis on age in age okay some other

259
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,420
property which may be more naturalistic

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,480
arizim is additive sorry girls I'm as a

261
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,099
product is the sum of the rug and so

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,839
because I am interested in shop vectors

263
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,580
in the real space and not in the rock

264
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,850
space so it needs a link between the two

265
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,770
and again it's still it's natural so the

266
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,110
Euclidean norm of my vector in the real

267
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:45,110
place is roughly two to the Infinity

268
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:47,700
norm in the rock space of the local okay

269
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:51,230
so now I'm going to use this logarithm

270
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:54,029
function to describe this algorithm so

271
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,920
first observation is so let's look at

272
00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:01,140
log of the elements of my ideal so

273
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,029
remember so I have log of G one of the

274
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,699
generator and because it's additive and

275
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,930
all the points are on the right of H on

276
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:14,880
some head space then they're all above

277
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:17,399
the line log G plus capital H and the

278
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,310
elements that are underlying logic plus

279
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,829
capital H they are exactly block G Plus

280
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,959
log of a unit so log G times a unit

281
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,640
which is log of a generator of the idea

282
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,430
so on my line log and sorry on the line

283
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,699
h plus R of G I get all your garrison of

284
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:40,399
the units the generator sorry of the

285
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:44,070
idol and so okay so I have the point of

286
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,959
Tourism of the ideal and now I want I

287
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,990
would like to find the smallest one so

288
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,239
the smallest I can do is this star which

289
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,130
is at the intersection between log G

290
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,959
Plus H and the one axis it's the

291
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,360
smallest point that is on the right of

292
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,089
love g plus h and so this is the one I

293
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,279
would like to to reach so maybe this one

294
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,600
is not in the ideal but I want to find

295
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,089
the point of the idea which is the

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,579
closest to the star and so good

297
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,620
candidate for this is a generator

298
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,510
because the generators are already on

299
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,190
the good line and we just want to find

300
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,170
the one which is the closest possible to

301
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:20,019
the one axis so that's

302
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,579
how's this deep altruism work so first

303
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:24,100
thing is we're going to compute a

304
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,649
generator and we want to then find the

305
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,420
best senior writer so okay let's first

306
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,070
start by computing a generator this is

307
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,410
previous work this can be done in

308
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,170
quantum polynomial time or two to the

309
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,949
square root and classical time so we get

310
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,620
a generator which is which will be

311
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,510
usually large and now we want we would

312
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,399
like to find the dnieper which is close

313
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,010
as possible to the one axis and so how

314
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,579
do we do that we're going to project log

315
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,069
of G 1 on H and then we will solve a

316
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,829
closest vector problem with the lattice

317
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,589
lambda so finding the closest unit and

318
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:03,609
then we just remove it from look G 1 and

319
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:05,320
we get the best generator 30 idea so now

320
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,660
we have to question here the first one

321
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,190
is so I've told you that finding closes

322
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,290
vector being product of problem is a

323
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,630
half program so how do we do that and

324
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,449
the second one is how good is the

325
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,820
approximation factor I get so the answer

326
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,250
to both question was given so in the CDP

327
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,920
algorithm and what they did is exhibited

328
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,170
a good basis of the large entities so

329
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,709
the basis the exhibit is somehow also

330
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:32,769
kernel so solving the CVP program in the

331
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,239
national basis is just rounding it into

332
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:37,240
coordinates so this can be done in

333
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,560
polynomial time and there's a shot at

334
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,480
the distance between two consecutive

335
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,439
right points is roughly square written

336
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,019
so the distance between my best

337
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,820
generator and the star will be at most

338
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,350
square root N and because I'm in the log

339
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,240
space it means that when I go back to

340
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,209
the real space I get an approximation

341
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,220
factor 2 to the square root N and so

342
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,899
that's how we can obtain a 2 to the

343
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,589
square root an approximation factor in

344
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:05,740
putting on your quantum time so now let

345
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:08,140
me explain to you what we did in order

346
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:13,149
to try to obtain all the trade-offs

347
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:16,630
between this order traders so the first

348
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:19,300
thing to observe is usually and when we

349
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,519
take the log of a generator at random it

350
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,479
will fall between I mean a distance

351
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:29,380
square root n over 2 of any good any

352
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:33,160
units so most of the time

353
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,810
the best generator will be a to to the

354
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,520
square root n of our to approximation

355
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,270
factor of the smallest element of the

356
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,790
idea and so we cannot do better than 2

357
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,500
to the square root n over 2

358
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,500
approximation factor by just looking at

359
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,270
generality havior but if we look at all

360
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,800
the point in the ideal one of them

361
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,350
should be close to the star so this is

362
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,689
something we know it's just that it

363
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,090
usually is not a generator so what we

364
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,330
want is to find this point which is

365
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:04,060
close to the star so how we do that

366
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,000
again we start the same way we compute

367
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,449
the generator and we project it on edge

368
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,890
and so here bad situation we're in the

369
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,630
middle of 2 right point so here the

370
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:17,230
problem is that the log unit that is is

371
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,000
not advanced enough so we have points of

372
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,130
the space which are distance square root

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,660
n of every point of the Reg unit that is

374
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,820
so what we do is we increase the density

375
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,339
of the drug unit at this by taking

376
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,860
elements of small algebraic norm so that

377
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,960
means they have a small coordinate on

378
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,140
the one axis and we're going to project

379
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:37,600
them on H and so when we get a new point

380
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,420
we can also add the loggers the unit to

381
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,820
this point and so we get a shifted log

382
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,969
unit status and we can do that again and

383
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:50,230
again until we have created sufficiently

384
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:52,480
many points such that the density of the

385
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,280
lattice is such that for any target I

386
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,300
know that I will have a point a distance

387
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,220
at most constant from my target and so

388
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,829
that's that's what we do so now I'm

389
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,990
calling L this neurotic so I'm lying

390
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,079
it's not lattice there because it's just

391
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,000
a union of shifted lattices so how do we

392
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,329
make it like this this is the latest are

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,510
going to consider we consider so its

394
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,240
current so the first vectors are the

395
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,950
units and then we have the projection of

396
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,020
the organism of all the elements with

397
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:25,569
small algebraic now and to make

398
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,720
iterative we had a block with one on the

399
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:30,450
diagonal below

400
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,060
in amounts of similar to break now and

401
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,100
the target we which was so the point

402
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,639
which we will target in this lattice is

403
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,110
the point with 0 on the bottom part and

404
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,880
the projection of the logarithm of the

405
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:48,850
generator on the top part

406
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,130
and so this okay the one on the diagonal

407
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,840
they allow us to control the number of

408
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,700
time we are going to add an element of

409
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,470
smarter algebraic naam and we don't want

410
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,080
to add them too many times because each

411
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,910
time we add these elements we are going

412
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,919
to increase the component on the one

413
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,760
axis so if we had too many of them then

414
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,550
we will go star from the star so this I

415
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,530
mean this serves to problem not being an

416
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,669
artist and being able to control the

417
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,750
algebraic norm of the solution and so

418
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,860
here we need a heuristic assumption

419
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:24,430
which is that we are so we assume that

420
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,459
if we take enough in amount of knowledge

421
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,920
Eric Nam so roughly and again quasi mean

422
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,510
are in n then we assume that the

423
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,250
covering radius of this lattice is

424
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,020
constant meaning that for any target

425
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,000
point I can find the point of this

426
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:43,300
lattice a distance at constant C stand

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,850
for from my target so this I'm

428
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,730
considering I'm just serving CVP in this

429
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,219
status for this target vector and now

430
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,810
the main question is remember in cbpr it

431
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,790
was easy to search the closet sort of

432
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,000
program because they add an orthogonal

433
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,430
basis and with the new lattice and I've

434
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,820
joined shown to you we don't know if any

435
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,830
good basis so CVP is hard to solve but

436
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,750
the important observation is that the

437
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,699
lattice only depends on the ring and not

438
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,470
on the idea so it's just unit and

439
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,320
elements of the ring of similar break

440
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,920
now so we can do some free computation

441
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,840
on it and so we are going to use some

442
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,840
CVP algorithm so close up Vector Prime

443
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,899
with pre-processing so in the article we

444
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,659
are using the one from lava at saks 2016

445
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,910
but since since then new algorithm has

446
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,860
been proposed but as some tactic needs

447
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,710
they're all the same so they enable us

448
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,409
to so modulo two to the N for a

449
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,810
computation we can then find an element

450
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,450
at distance n to the Alpha of the target

451
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:48,010
in time two to the n to the 1 minus 2

452
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:51,520
alpha and so if I summarize if I put

453
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,680
everything together so I obtain in the

454
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,480
rack space end to the approximation

455
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,770
factor so in the real space it's 2 to

456
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,160
the N to the Alpha

457
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,690
that query time is suited to the end to

458
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,929
the 1 minus 2 alpha so this is for

459
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,059
solving the CVP problem plus the time

460
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,130
needed to compute a generator so is a

461
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,649
polynomial time in quantum auto 2 the

462
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,240
square root n in classical setting and

463
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,820
there is a professor thing for the CVP

464
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,309
algorithm and so we obtain this figure

465
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,860
and so there's a plateau in the

466
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,710
classical setting is because of the

467
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,580
computation of the generator which is 2

468
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:31,420
to the square root n so let me just

469
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,428
conclude with the extension so what I

470
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,830
presented to you was in the case of

471
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:38,020
power of two cyclotomic fields and four

472
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,689
principal ideals but we can generalize

473
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,260
that to none principal ideals to any

474
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:46,090
ideas and also to all number fields so

475
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,500
the picture changed like this on the

476
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,149
left you have the case where the

477
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,429
discriminant is quasi linear in the

478
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,250
degree so it's almost the same picture

479
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:57,010
except that in the classical setting the

480
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,530
plateau is a bit above because the time

481
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:04,059
required to compute a generator in the

482
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:08,020
in any number field is due to the entity

483
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:10,540
2/3 and when the discriminant starts

484
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,800
being increasing being more than quasi

485
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,178
denying the degree of the field then

486
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,870
trade-off degrade and at some point it's

487
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,860
no better than the beginning and that's

488
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:27,830
all for me thank you

489
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:40,590
[Applause]

490
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:42,239
so any questions so you start from the

491
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,699
original lattice and you build this new

492
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:48,480
this new lattice where you'll find the

493
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,999
element but so but in in between you had

494
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,360
this collection of lattices so couldn't

495
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:56,489
you why did you need to construct the

496
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,110
target lattice and not like look for the

497
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:09,409
element in that collection of lattice of

498
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:12,209
what yes yeah so here the points I've

499
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:15,899
drawn it's not a lattice because it's

500
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:18,989
union of lattices so the way we make you

501
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:21,779
to that is by yes but so that's what so

502
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:23,070
there is not a lattice but your element

503
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:31,369
that you're looking for it's still there

504
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:34,109
it's in one of those lattices no I mean

505
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:36,629
so you're technically you don't it's not

506
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,999
okay so I'm I've been laying here it's

507
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:44,340
not a union effect is because you also

508
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:46,409
can add R 1 and R 2 I mean it's one of

509
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,570
the combination of all these points so

510
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,940
you can do linear combination of these

511
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,519
points but not just not too many of them

512
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,590
so you have some limit but it's not in

513
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,600
this union that you will find your point

514
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,100
it's usually it will be in the linear

515
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,539
combination of the points that are drawn

516
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,590
there and so if you want to consider

517
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,029
everything it will be coming

518
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,830
exponentially many lattices and why that

519
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,679
so you said that for two for this all to

520
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:14,460
work you need ideal lattices so it

521
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:18,179
doesn't work on generic lattices that's

522
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,619
what you say yes explicitly using the

523
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,350
algebraic structure we are using the

524
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:26,070
fact that it's an idea just to compute

525
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,289
it in right of it for instance so you

526
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,739
cannot like just from a normal lattice

527
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:33,359
you cannot associate no no I mean an

528
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:37,669
arbitrary that this does not correspond

529
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,668
to an ideal that it is necessary no

530
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:50,080
hello so I would like to know if you

531
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:52,090
have some idea about how sensible to

532
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,850
this zero istic is your algorithm a mean

533
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,639
maybe there is it the property that you

534
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,918
are requiring is not true for all t just

535
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:08,880
me for some T's and then would the

536
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:13,990
algorithm is to work in this case yes I

537
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:17,890
mean what we expected that the top part

538
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:20,679
of T is somehow uniformly distributed so

539
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:24,010
it should work I mean maybe you if it

540
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,380
works for T's with zero coordinates on

541
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:30,158
the bottom part but you need for me for

542
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,970
any top part it would be sufficient but

543
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,700
this is a simplification in the case of

544
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,770
principle ideas in the case of general

545
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,470
sorry of any idea we also have

546
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,070
coefficient and the bottom part so we

547
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,130
essentially need that any uniformity on

548
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:52,539
target is close to point of the lattice

549
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:55,000
so maybe so we can rerun demise so if

550
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,549
with probability one over two we are at

551
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:05,309
constant distance its it would be enough

552
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:08,710
forests may be any more questions so

553
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:11,379
let's thank our speaker again

554
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,380
[Applause]
