1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
speaker yeah so now I'm going to talk

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,740
about some strengthening of what your

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,590
fault is this crime so decision work

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,309
with Andrew supplement Daniel weeks so

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm going to look back at what I talked

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,990
before and what so pretty much what we

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,330
built is a design engineer for an Isaac

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,640
so just to take a step back we have a

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,959
proven every failure but now summer is

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,289
approaching so they remove their hat on

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,420
shaved so that's how they look now and

12
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,369
pretty much so so then there's a serious

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,620
in the sky and even this year as the

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,280
prover using your witness for first

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,199
eight months

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,180
there's only proved to be very fire and

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,430
then very very are using some special

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,059
verification key then decide to accept

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,870
all of the proof so what I'll be many

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,480
interested in during the sport is the

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,519
setup assumption that we make in

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,589
particular the setup solution that we

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,260
make that there is a magical entity that

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,460
both publishes a series in the sky but

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,700
also gives this secret it should verify

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,799
so in particular the setup is kind of

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,780
complex in the sense that the first

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,760
party has to interact with every

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,860
verifier that participates in protocol

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,689
and portrayal if there's many pairs of

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,070
say prove a verifier that wants to

32
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,949
participate then the trust setup has to

33
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,158
talk to every verifier so natural

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,770
question is to realize distress that our

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,570
assumption and to have something that is

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,840
much simpler and possible it would be

37
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,850
nice if we could make sense merchants

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,909
simply by using simple to set up a

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,039
vanity so what do i mean by that

40
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,200
so that actually defines someone

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,659
actually the notion of many shoes design

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,810
interior furnishings where the setup is

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,310
really just saris so there's a magic

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,590
arts restaurant easy that publishes a

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,390
series in the sky and after that can go

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:01,320
offline after that any verifier can just

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,790
look at this at the CRS and pick himself

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,279
a secret key so that will be his

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,959
verification key but now in some sense

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,700
the proof produced by the prover has in

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,330
different in some sense should this

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,089
verification key so what the Verena

53
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,610
she also picks a public key that depends

54
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,240
on this verification key and that's in

55
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,430
the sky so now given this yearís and

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,360
this public key any proven looking at

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,209
both can publish a proof and so generate

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,910
a pie and now the verify or dependent is

59
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:38,330
a verification he can decide to whether

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:42,049
accept or reject the proof so in popular

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,170
only the only chance we make it's

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,380
raining some in the setup in the setup

63
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:52,458
phase in some sense so the protocol

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,079
still has a strong flavor disunity

65
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,180
prefer an easy in the sense that for

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,880
incentive proof our privately verifiable

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,989
and there's no hope that this will be

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,390
easier to restrict Dianetics but at the

69
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,769
same time we don't want to shift the

70
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,839
threat of the trusted party to be very

71
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,330
fire and popular the very far would be

72
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,030
malicious for you know so what we want

73
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,400
is really to ensure that whenever the

74
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,140
very failure is malicious then security

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,660
holds on so in this case your knowledge

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,510
and popular the verifier can pick his

77
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,859
pair of keys maliciously but actually

78
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,048
from the point of view of the prover

79
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,170
it's not even clear that even any secret

80
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,299
key associated so what we really want is

81
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,290
that the 0h property holds given

82
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,760
arbitrary malashri generated public keys

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,890
and in that sense the security that we

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,510
get is much closer to the music and also

85
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,950
the setup in the sense that the only

86
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,380
thing we trust is really

87
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:51,108
that's a magical entity put a serious in

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:53,870
this guy just just a quick remark so

89
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,970
this is the notion of distinctive

90
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,060
measures isn't even for an easy core MTV

91
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,459
music and if I just reward our own

92
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,170
another way you can look at that is read

93
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,299
that we have some kind of true round a

94
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,100
zero knowledge protocol but what makes

95
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,799
it really interesting is that the first

96
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,590
the first message is reversible so that

97
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:17,239
really what gives this non interactivity

98
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,488
flavor oh yeah so now the natural

99
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,228
question is how do we build that so the

100
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,590
wrong map will follow pretty much

101
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,349
closely what Rafa talked about so Joe

102
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,530
Hodges showed that if we start with a V

103
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,599
porcinis

104
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,440
and if you start with a designated

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,600
verifier version of pure cheese you get

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,110
a divinization so naturally what I'll

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,360
focus here on words is to focus on

108
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,950
measures version of that and show that

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,260
pretty much that so fast is fun isak

110
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:52,370
sign how to build my MVP RG okay

111
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,650
so recall how do we use a TV PR g to

112
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,380
implement an easy engine

113
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,530
so here the prover which was a scene the

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,440
seed along with the service we define a

115
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,380
mini many random bits and the prover

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,050
will also have generate proofs that bits

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,000
are generated correctly so now to

118
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,280
implement the hidden beats the prover

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,720
was simply sent a short commitment to

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,099
the scene along with hidden bits and

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,660
local proofs that those bits are

122
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,790
generated honestly so this translates

123
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,650
directly to the malicious flavor were

124
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,800
the verifier now picks himself whiskey

125
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,460
and gives him gives publishes of public

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,160
in the sky oh yeah so now the only thing

127
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,659
that changes if the magic if the very

128
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,990
very honest everything is the same as

129
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,880
before

130
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,940
the only thing that changes is when the

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,800
profiles man issues and what we used for

132
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,050
charge with zero knowledge of the

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,660
designer forensic in the end is really

134
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,240
that when the prover give a local

135
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,860
opening through some bits the other bits

136
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,910
still remains hidden that's really what

137
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,950
makes the hidden bits journal go through

138
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,910
so we want that naturally to how it even

139
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:07,880
maliciously generated public keys and

140
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,040
it's not too hard to show that pretty

141
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,070
much the syntactical I think didn't

142
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,880
change the proof on meditatively PRG

143
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,340
implies maltose divinities so now we

144
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,780
reduce the problem of constructing MDV

145
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,289
disease through the program of

146
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,890
construction

147
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:29,510
Malchus so mtv PR geez so the natural

148
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:32,570
step is how do you construct that so let

149
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,159
me recall briefly the you know like side

150
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,590
you rephrase the construction of roof oh

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
and a natural question is to check

152
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,948
whether the confession we gave before

153
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,169
natively satisfies the property

154
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,819
so again you have a seed like a

155
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:48,258
commitment receipt that will just just

156
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,199
be a creeper element and s will be the

157
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,780
seed that is chosen by the by the

158
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,810
approver and this is the same as a in

159
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,969
Reverse dog so in the series there's a

160
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,639
lot of different group elements tráfico

161
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,069
that GGI and pretty much you define

162
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,569
those hidden piece to simply be those

163
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:10,250
group elements in the series raised yes

164
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,259
so now there's also another part in a

165
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,969
series that allows you to check whether

166
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,030
those bits have been generated quietly

167
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:20,599
and part even or you have some group

168
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:25,039
elements that that help you prove that

169
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:27,800
pretty much s1 and G have the same

170
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,568
discrete log in some sense so from far

171
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,180
talked about the dirt twinsies - shake

172
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,819
another which we see is that we actually

173
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,030
have a design intent very failure newzik

174
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,560
for kind of digital age and that's

175
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,369
exactly crime ership so that just

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,029
another way to look at it oh yeah so now

177
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,610
we can directly change we can daringly

178
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,830
change the syntax to handle verifier

179
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,349
that picked up a blue key that will be

180
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,599
the part that allows them to prove out

181
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,880
of the prover to prove whether the bits

182
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,830
are correct and now what we want is that

183
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,840
some kind of resilience whenever those

184
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,758
group elements are generated maliciously

185
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,878
so say the the failure wants to attack

186
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,889
the first hidden beats well a natural

187
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,620
thing to do so in patchwork you won't

188
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,379
get the proof for the first beat but a

189
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,840
very easy thing to do is to simply

190
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:24,020
rewire so in fact you are given the

191
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,039
Sierras you can just set the last

192
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,870
elements of office public it should be

193
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,460
the Seminole man as the first bit of the

194
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,620
Sierras

195
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,659
not even how the profits actually just

196
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,448
receiving the proof directly reveals the

197
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,269
first bit so it seems like very easy we

198
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:44,899
broke it pretty easily so is a hop

199
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:47,329
lowest well it turns out we can fit that

200
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,300
so much easily and how do we fix that

201
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:54,010
will simply make all the hidden bits

202
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,649
depend on many more group elements

203
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,750
so what do I mean by that now we will

204
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,860
have many many more group elements that

205
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,470
the number of hidden bits that we want

206
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,089
in the end and what we will do is simply

207
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,649
to pitch some random graph and now every

208
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:12,220
every hidden bit with dependent many

209
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:15,399
random different basically elements okay

210
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,500
so how well and also like to check the

211
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,250
proofs now we need to give the quite

212
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,620
appropriate krupa demonstrated yes so

213
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,810
how does it help us well I was supposed

214
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,980
to again that the verifier wants to

215
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,560
learn something about the first hidden

216
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,860
beads now with high probability over the

217
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,560
graph well so first she has to actually

218
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,230
recover if we procure some your favorite

219
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,729
hardcore B's let's recover all those

220
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,570
groupie remonstrated yes if you want to

221
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,310
do anything meaningful and in particular

222
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,440
over the randomness of the graph there's

223
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,359
at least some group elements that does

224
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,720
not appear anywhere in the other hidden

225
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,920
beads that the very first to learn if

226
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,610
you want to learn anything about the

227
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,290
hidden bit so in particular for the

228
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,510
simple mix-and-match attack that I

229
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,839
described before you can also argue that

230
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,579
for sufficiently high number of group

231
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,370
based group elements that was that's

232
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,260
also happen so if the very firm manage

233
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,079
is true this to do anything meaningful

234
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,110
with the first hidden beats you will she

235
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,969
can actually compute some hods like by

236
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,510
itself so that sounds we made progress

237
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:29,319
but again that's us simply for very a

238
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:31,839
very restricted class of attacks so what

239
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,910
we show is that actually if we pick this

240
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,310
run on graphene especially careful way

241
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,420
you can actually prove security against

242
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,910
any any other sort strategy for the any

243
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,050
malicious very failure under a stronger

244
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,370
assumption let's go to one more

245
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,810
situation sumption so it's like you're

246
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:52,990
one more version of CH and that will

247
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:57,069
directly give the militia dignity prefer

248
00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:00,329
an Isaac from one message so next shoe

249
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:04,829
is going to talk about compact

250
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,829
processing is it says so
