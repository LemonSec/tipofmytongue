1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
so I'm going to talk about maliciously

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:22,740
secure private set intersection

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:24,660
I'd say joint work with Tobias so so

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,759
specifically I'm going to we are going

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,710
to realize this functionality of psi

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,740
where both the parties will get the

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,860
output of the protocol so AF and we have

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,960
this say it's a say an SV and the the

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,600
functionality will give the intersection

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,640
of this SA and SB nothing else to both

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,410
the parties so we are in the settings

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,170
where the set size are same or similar

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,779
you can pat it to make it same and also

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,539
we are considering security against

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,989
malicious adversary

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,820
so why psi so as already which I

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,250
mentioned that this is a really

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,730
practically motivated problem and it's

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,220
app it comes in many real-life scenarios

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,560
for example he mentioned about this

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,450
measuring ad conversion rate but there

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,729
are also many other applications like

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,340
private contact discovery matchmaking

24
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,450
ride-sharing secure skates and many

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,939
other things and there actually many

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,400
work has been done on this to party psi

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,740
primitive and specifically also on

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,040
actively seek EO to party psi primitive

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,710
but very few were considered the

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,450
multi-party settings so in this work

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,908
specifically like actively secure

32
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,369
multi-party setting so in this work we

33
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,310
try to construct more efficient

34
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:45,869
multi-party psi protocol which is secure

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,470
against a malicious adversary so in this

36
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,740
process we actually find propose several

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,200
secure psi protocol based on one

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,419
primitive which is called oblivious

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,790
linear function evaluation so

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,040
specifically we propose a to PFS

41
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,780
proposed a to psi protocol with optimal

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,750
communication complexity like which is

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,419
linear in the set size and the

44
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,300
computational complexity is dominated by

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,238
order of M log M field multiplication

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,819
and then we generalize this to psi

47
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,250
protocol to multi by D psi protocol with

48
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,549
communication complexity of n square

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,250
plus n MK where n is the number of

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,610
parties so usually this n is much

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,010
smaller than the set size M so we kind

52
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,989
of get almost linear communication

53
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,840
complexity for actively secure

54
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,480
multi-party psi protocol and for the

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,410
computational complexity is it is order

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,569
of n M log M basic field multiplication

57
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,910
we also give a protocol for threshold

58
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,190
multi-party psi with same communication

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,950
and completely computational complexity

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,670
and threshold multi-party psi means

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,500
every party will learn the intersection

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,069
when the size of the intersection is

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,629
greater than some threshold value and

64
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,879
all these protocols are information

65
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,120
theoretically secure in le hybrid model

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,518
and so we can say like in comparison

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,019
with other in psi protocol our protocol

68
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,049
kind of asymptotically beats all the

69
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,650
existing maliciously secure psi

70
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,389
protocols and this is the first

71
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,549
instantiation of a threshold multi-party

72
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,819
psi protocol which has your active

73
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,280
security and also almost linear

74
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,888
communication over it and note that for

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,970
the two party threshold psi protocol it

76
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,530
actually achieved the linear

77
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,079
communication over it because this is

78
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:42,459
kind of in minus 1 whole square so it's

79
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:44,829
just go away so we find this result in

80
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,989
le hybrid model now the question is what

81
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,060
is Whaley so this is a primitive called

82
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,160
oblivious linear function evaluation

83
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,410
where to part it is a two-party

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,900
primitive where one party the sender

85
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,859
holds this linear function ax plus B and

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,630
the other party holds this evaluation

87
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,000
point alpha and at the end of the

88
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,250
protocol receiver will lani alpha plus b

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,079
and sender will learn nothing so there

90
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,750
are many available construction

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,019
passively secure or actively secure it

92
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,450
cetera but for our specific instance

93
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:20,320
ation of the PSI protocol we use a

94
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,900
maliciously secure oily protocol from GN

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,560
n 17 which also achieve constant

96
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,679
communication over it

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,920
now how to do psi from Willie so from

98
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,060
Whaley we define a functionality

99
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,720
restrictive functionality really Plus

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,690
which actually I don't allow the

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,760
receiver to input 0 valleys in the oily

102
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,770
functionality and then from that we

103
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,560
define a functionality called oblivious

104
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:51,090
polynomial ever addition so we define

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,860
this Opia functionality which

106
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,830
essentially take two polynomial

107
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,740
randomized it and add it and from this

108
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,550
opa functionality we get this our

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,130
two-party PSI protocol and from this

110
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,650
two-party psi protocol we get this

111
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,810
multi-party psi protocol and I note that

112
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,030
like if you don't want active security

113
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,370
you can go from this oily directly to

114
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:20,369
this OPA functionality and then to the

115
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:24,030
PSI and multi-party psi so it's a nice

116
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,460
background so how to do this to psi from

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,549
Whaley so the idea is simple first you

118
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,270
encode your Paulino sets into polynomial

119
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,910
such that each element of the set

120
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:39,180
represent the root of the polynomial so

121
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:43,020
alleys encode is set SI to PA of X in

122
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,890
this way Bob encode is said his be to PB

123
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:51,330
of X and this way and then observe this

124
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:53,070
PA of X plus P V of X the roots of this

125
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,710
polynomial the roots of this polynomial

126
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,860
you can actually detect the intersection

127
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,770
of two sets but obviously this is not

128
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,200
secure because given this PA of X plus P

129
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,599
V of X one can remove this P V of X and

130
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:11,010
learn the input of the other party

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,380
totally so how to resolve this issue so

132
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,800
the simple thing what we can do is just

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,540
randomize this polynomials and add them

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,840
and so and we call it the intersection

135
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:29,190
polynomial which is PA into r1 plus PB

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,080
into r2 and so if you see closely again

137
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,750
the roots of this polynomial actually

138
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,570
gives the intersection of these two sets

139
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,610
SA and SB so actually this is already

140
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,229
shown by Krishna and so

141
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,509
that this ran linear randomized

142
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:48,990
polynomial can be written as like GCD of

143
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,629
P a comma P B into some uniform random

144
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,500
polynomial of some of the matching

145
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:58,340
degree and the roots of this GCD of P NP

146
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,460
B already gives the intersection and

147
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,679
this roots from this uniform polynomial

148
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,620
actually gives no information about the

149
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,710
other parties input so we use this fact

150
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,289
so in this paper actually they kind of

151
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,448
encrypt this polynomial with additively

152
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,430
home Orphic encryption and then for

153
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,699
maliciously say a malicious security

154
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,259
they use zero knowledge proof so that's

155
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,169
why using this heavy cryptographic

156
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,629
machinery they they lose the concrete

157
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:30,628
efficiency of the protocol so instead

158
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:36,449
what we use we use this primitive Whaley

159
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:37,949
to do this randomized addition so so

160
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,750
first we I define this functionality

161
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,580
which is called OPA of Livia's

162
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,120
polynomial addition and this

163
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,340
functionality Alice give input his input

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,279
polynomial PA and some random polynomial

165
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,219
R and Bob give his input polynomial PB

166
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:57,180
and at the end of the protocols Bob will

167
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:59,370
learn this PA plus PB into R so in other

168
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,560
terms actually Alice randomized Bob's

169
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,550
input polynomial and add his polynomial

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,219
to that so how we can realize this

171
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:11,940
functionality we can realize it from

172
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:14,520
Whaley in a simple manner so the so note

173
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,190
that the input of a and B is this PA and

174
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,870
PB polynomial which are of degree M and

175
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:25,560
now a choose random polynomial r1 and r2

176
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,740
of degree m and randomize his own

177
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,529
polynomial PA with this r1 well so we I

178
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:37,140
call it P which is equal to PA into R of

179
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:40,078
1 and then Alys evaluate his polynomial

180
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,269
P and this random polynomial R versa

181
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:46,019
publicly known index like alpha 1 to

182
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,600
alpha to him and Bob will also do the

183
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,870
same thing with his input polynomial PB

184
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,850
and then they invoked like

185
00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:01,170
- Emily's where Alice's input is P of

186
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:06,390
alpha I and r2 of alpha and Bob's input

187
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:09,420
is PB of alpha so now from each

188
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:13,800
invocation of this oily Bob will learn

189
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:17,520
this PB into r2 plus P of like

190
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,620
evaluation of PB into r2 plus P and you

191
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,380
can see that degree of this PB a degree

192
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,770
of this r2 is M so the total degree of

193
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:29,270
this polynomial is 2m so from 2m

194
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:33,449
evolution points Bob can reconstruct the

195
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,569
polynomial PA into r1 plus PB into r2 so

196
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,510
that's the functionality with order of M

197
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:42,570
really calls you can actually randomize

198
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,689
and add two polynomials it's interesting

199
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:48,120
to note that it's already this function

200
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,940
leader already gives a one sided to psi

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,090
protocol with passive security because

202
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,850
this randomized polynomial all already

203
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,210
contains the encoding of the

204
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:02,730
intersection so but with passive

205
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,130
security and yeah this protocol is

206
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,280
definitely information theoretic in F

207
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,340
willy hybrid model and the communication

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:15,449
complexity is like order of M field

209
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:18,630
elements even if you implement this F we

210
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,690
using that Whaley protocol from gene and

211
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,280
seventeen because that has a constant

212
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,280
communication or it and it's coming back

213
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,070
okay

214
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,379
okay so we are done with this opa

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,389
functionality so from Whaley we designed

216
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,610
this opa functionality with passive

217
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,579
security but what about active security

218
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,769
for active security we have to use

219
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,888
actively security box in place of

220
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:15,930
assembly securely but that's not enough

221
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,149
we have to ensure that receiver cannot

222
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,459
input a zero value to all the early

223
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:23,339
invocations because otherwise the

224
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,888
receiver can learn the polynomial of the

225
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,980
sender fully so we define a

226
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:32,249
functionality core Willy plus we do that

227
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:36,749
task for us and which requests only two

228
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:38,730
Oh Ellie calls and and then at the end

229
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:40,050
we need a consistency check and we are

230
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,610
working with the polynomials and

231
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,559
whenever working with polynomials that's

232
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,180
nice because you have the input and

233
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,309
output polynomials you pick a random

234
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,199
point and check the consistency of the

235
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:52,649
polynomial so that's a simple check we

236
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:54,359
do at the end of the protocol and so we

237
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,540
are done with actively secure OPA

238
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,910
protocol now from this I will show that

239
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,889
how we achieve the actively secure to

240
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,870
psi when both the party will get the

241
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:09,930
output so the idea is that Alice now

242
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,990
choose this random polynomial UA which

243
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,939
has some degree to him and some random

244
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,720
polynomial re and are a prime with the

245
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:21,529
with power degree M and they in Alice

246
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,199
and Bob invoke the if OPA functionality

247
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:29,309
where Alice input this UA and Ra and Bob

248
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:31,709
input is polynomial PV as a result the

249
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:35,670
Bob will get this is V which is PB into

250
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:38,339
RA plus u a this actually can be seen as

251
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,979
a secret sharing of this randomized to

252
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:47,160
polynomial PB into re where a sphere is

253
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:49,499
minus UA and B's share is SB so given

254
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,899
that like Bob will also do the same

255
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:56,339
thing yield to some UB and RB and sacred

256
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:59,279
share the is polynomial PA into RB so

257
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,819
once they're done with that Alice and

258
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,079
Bob will dynamize these things in a way

259
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:07,529
and add the

260
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:11,819
in such a way such that it will result

261
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:14,519
in this polynomial which is PA into some

262
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:17,579
random polynomial plus PB into some

263
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,850
random polynomial and this is this

264
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:24,060
already gives the intersection so and

265
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,509
then at the end they will run the

266
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,069
similar consistency check like

267
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:30,839
evaluating their input and output

268
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:33,839
polynomial in a random point and check

269
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,420
whether the relation holds now if you

270
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,670
see closely like this part of this

271
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,149
protocol don't leak any information

272
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,540
because this PB into RA is masked by a

273
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:50,399
random to M degree polynomial UA and

274
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:53,250
this PA into RB is a random to M degree

275
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,949
polynomial UV so the up to this point

276
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,380
this is totally secure but a malicious

277
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:02,279
adversary can try to Duran demise it in

278
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,800
many different ways but that leads to

279
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,459
the wrong polynomial because this EA and

280
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,769
UV are chosen totally in random and if

281
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,680
they say wrong polynomial then the check

282
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,019
will fail and then the both the party

283
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,649
can about so that's the whole protocol

284
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:22,439
and the communication complexity is

285
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:24,810
order of M field elements because this

286
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:26,969
opa can be implemented with order of M

287
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,699
fill elements and for D randomization

288
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,399
again you have to transfer of him field

289
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:35,430
elements and computational complexity is

290
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,329
dominated by order of in law game field

291
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,560
multiplication because of the to detect

292
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,859
the intersection you have to do the

293
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,369
multi point evaluation of this this

294
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,139
final polynomial and that requires this

295
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:53,000
first one will transform which requires

296
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:57,990
the same login filled multiplications so

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,970
we are done with this two psi and now

298
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,370
how we I will show I will give the

299
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,509
intuition that how we can get this multi

300
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:10,230
by D psi from this two psi kind of

301
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:14,100
directly so so we use the star topology

302
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:17,010
like from front paper by mu-2 and kermit

303
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,020
for 2017 so

304
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,660
here I take a toy example of three-party

305
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:25,140
a case where three parties a B and C

306
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,949
they have their polynomial P a P B and P

307
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:32,790
C now C will say compute the

308
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:35,880
intersection and then C you learn to two

309
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,099
party protocol FRA with a and B to learn

310
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,680
the intersection polynomial P a

311
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,160
intersection C and P B intersection C

312
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,680
now if you see like he defined this

313
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,740
intersection polynomial as PA

314
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,310
intersection C plus P B intersection C

315
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,100
and root of this polynomial already give

316
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:01,939
a intersection B intersection C okay so

317
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:04,710
we are done but unfortunately no because

318
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,240
here the central body can learn the

319
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,430
intermediate intersection so we can

320
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,030
learn intersection between a and C and

321
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,680
the intersection between B and C which

322
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,360
is not allowed in the ideal

323
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,329
functionality so we have to do something

324
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,030
about that so what we do is like we

325
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,030
allow a and B to run a set of phase

326
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,329
where they can talk to each other and

327
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,370
make some random mask like RA and RB

328
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:32,130
after they're done with that then C

329
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:36,360
start talking with a and B and run the

330
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:39,180
two party psi protocol and where a use

331
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,230
the random masquerade minus RB and be

332
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,079
used random mask minus RA minus RB so at

333
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,170
the end of the protocol DC will learn

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:53,520
this the same polynomial masked with

335
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,400
some value and from this instance you'll

336
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,110
learn some P B intersection C learnt

337
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,400
with the negative of that same

338
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,630
polynomial so now if we add both of them

339
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,459
you will get the same intersection

340
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,209
polynomial and thus can detect the

341
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:13,199
intersection but in this case C cannot

342
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,920
learn and this intermediate intersection

343
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,930
due to this random masking so yeah

344
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,640
that's a protocol and that can be

345
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,890
definitely extended to multi-party case

346
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,130
and for malicious security we have to

347
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,810
add a check similar check as the two

348
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,820
party psi protocol at the end of the

349
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,360
protocol so in terms of come

350
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,879
vacation for the setup phase so you can

351
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,879
a and B can actually exchange some PhD

352
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,090
seeds and then extend it to form this RA

353
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,450
and RB so it's like like in square

354
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,269
communication and then for this in

355
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,519
instances of 2 psi that is like in M

356
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:56,009
communication so the total communication

357
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:58,539
is like N squared plus n M into K and

358
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:02,139
computationally the central party have

359
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:04,408
to do in two psi instances so this is

360
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:08,459
dominated by n into M log in

361
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,720
multiplication so that's it does a

362
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,059
multi-party psi protocol for the full

363
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,809
protocol you can look into the paper

364
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:19,389
there are some many details so we are

365
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,370
done with the small T by D psi now I'll

366
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:25,178
give an intuition about how we can get

367
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:28,330
threshold multi by D psi from this multi

368
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:31,299
party psi protocol so let us consider a

369
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,399
two party one-sided PSI case the first

370
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,590
thing that would be a protocol so what

371
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,389
actually what's happening here so here

372
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,509
actually Bob learns this intersection

373
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:43,029
polynomial which is PA into r1 plus PB

374
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:45,070
into r2 and Bob evaluates this

375
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:48,879
intersection polynomial over its points

376
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,830
and get these outputs and whenever this

377
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:53,289
bi belongs to the intersection he will

378
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,928
get this white box which is zero output

379
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:57,730
and otherwise he will get some random

380
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,519
evaluation random points over the field

381
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,409
and from these zero outputs Bob can

382
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,320
detect the intersection so that's what's

383
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:07,629
happening in all the protocols now the

384
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,029
idea is to make it threshold use a

385
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:14,439
different encoding use the encoding says

386
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:18,370
that this PA prime of alpha evaluates to

387
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:22,659
1 instead of 0 when this alpha is in

388
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:27,129
from the set and similarly Bob can

389
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:29,500
encode his say it is V 2 PB prime such

390
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:32,559
that like when PB prime alpha is

391
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:36,460
evaluate to 1 if alpha belongs to this

392
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,190
SB so if you do that and we choose these

393
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,490
random polynomials not in a random way

394
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,650
but in a certain way such that this like

395
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:48,820
this r1 prime and r2 prime

396
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:51,760
of alpha gives a share of some LM robust

397
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,330
secret sharing scheme which like share

398
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:00,790
of the values of s1 and s2 where we want

399
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:02,889
to achieve this ill threshold so now if

400
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,250
we run the previous protocol like before

401
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,070
Bob will learn this polynomial which and

402
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,770
call that P intersection prime which is

403
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:15,939
P a prime into r1 prime plus PB prime

404
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:18,700
into R 2 prime and evolution of this

405
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:23,200
polynomial now give him something like

406
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:26,110
that where this for the B is for the BI

407
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,500
belongs to the intersection he will get

408
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,750
share of this s1 plus s2 because at

409
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,760
least PA Prime and P V prime evaluates

410
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,820
to 1 for this encoding

411
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,310
and this r1 prime alpha in R 2 prime

412
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,510
alpha gives in s1 plus s2 so he'll get

413
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:45,700
one share of s1 plus s2 and in the

414
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:49,420
similar way if we get like kind of ill

415
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,370
shares of s1 plus s2 from that ill sheis

416
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,120
he can really reconstruct this s1 plus

417
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,879
s2 and thus can detect the intersection

418
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,189
but there is a problem because now the

419
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,800
other evolution points are not random

420
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,440
because this r1 prime and r2 prime are

421
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,510
not random polynomial of degree m so

422
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,130
that might leak some information about

423
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:15,220
the other parties input so to resolve

424
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:19,180
that issue so one way to resolve that

425
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,070
issue is to use p intersection like

426
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,640
where you encode the polynomial like the

427
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:27,790
previous m PSI protocol and then use the

428
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,130
new encoding and define this p

429
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,879
intersection + p intersection prime as

430
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,830
the intersection polynomial so if you do

431
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,050
that then Bob will evaluate this

432
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,760
polynomial over his input so you'll get

433
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,490
something like that so first we get

434
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,620
these random points for the BI which

435
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,460
belongs to the intersection you will get

436
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:51,280
some 0 some random point 0 and so on and

437
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,430
from this thing he'll get something like

438
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,070
this where he gives the secret share of

439
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,210
s1 plus s2 whenever bi belongs to the

440
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,310
intersection

441
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:04,360
otherwise he will get something else we

442
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:09,310
don't care but now if you add those

443
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,439
things so this this gives like in the in

444
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,030
the position where bi actually belongs

445
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,850
to the intersection you will get the

446
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,000
share of s1 plus s2 and for the other

447
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,669
case the evolution points looks random

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,230
so we have to take care that in the

449
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,200
protocol we take care of the fact that

450
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:30,040
Bob ultimately will learn just this

451
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,930
polynomial not any like just not P

452
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,980
intersection or P intersection prime

453
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:38,410
separately so if so and then we are done

454
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,900
because from the here Bob can compute

455
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:45,340
this s 1 plus s 2 and then detect the

456
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,800
intersection and that's the and that can

457
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,179
be definitely extended to multi-party

458
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,200
case I just give an example for two

459
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,340
party case and it has a same

460
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,710
communication and computational

461
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,370
complexity as the multi party psi

462
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:03,550
protocol so with that I'm done so in

463
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,860
summary we give a very simple protocol

464
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:09,280
for actively secure two psi you know le

465
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,649
hybrid model we generalize it to from 2

466
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,610
psi to M psi this is the most efficient

467
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,900
I'm actively securing psi tilde and this

468
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,090
is also the first actively secure

469
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,450
threshold M psi protocol so in the paper

470
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,919
we also give a estimation of the

471
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,960
concrete performance we don't have an

472
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,160
implementation but we just estimate the

473
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,920
communication over rate of the paper and

474
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,400
so for the details you can look into

475
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,800
that paper actually surprisingly the

476
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,630
performance like at least communication

477
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,030
over rate of our to psi protocol is

478
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,930
comparable and in fact in some cases

479
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,620
it's better than the most efficient 2psi

480
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,330
actively secure to psi protocol and

481
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,939
future direction obviously you can use

482
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,460
the more optimization which is already

483
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,920
exist in the psi literature and then

484
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,690
implement this only PSI protocols to see

485
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,450
the actual concrete efficiency of these

486
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,760
protocols and one of the important thing

487
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,340
is that performance in offline and

488
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,500
online paradigm so all these things are

489
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,250
in early hybrid model so you can

490
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,650
- like in the offline phase you know you

491
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,480
can do all the Whaley's with random

492
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,030
input and then in the online phase you

493
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,950
can durán demise this oil is to get the

494
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,840
actual output and that actually

495
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,930
drastically improves the communication

496
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,129
overhead of the protocol and so that's

497
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:36,070
something to look into and then another

498
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,180
question is so we get a threshold psi

499
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,780
protocol with linear communication

500
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,910
complexity so we can look can we do

501
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,889
better so actually we have a protocol

502
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,040
with of threshold psi with sub linear

503
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,810
communication complexity and so maybe

504
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,020
I'll going to explain that in crypto

505
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:56,340
this year and so this is a print link

506
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,340
and thank you

507
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,610
Thank You satrajit for the talk and for

508
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:12,990
the expert handling of the glitch any

509
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:14,159
questions all right then let's thank all

510
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,980
the speakers in the session and thank

511
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,299
Lorenzo for expertly handling the glitch

512
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,299
