1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
so I thank you for the introduction this

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,740
is a joint work with Rio shota and

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,480
Takashi are from I stand NTT so this is

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,110
part three and it's only going to take

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,929
about ten more minutes okay so this is

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,570
our razón and what we have is that so as

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,010
Jeff all told us the first one is the

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,470
same for all three groups we got a

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,769
designated verifier disks from the CDH

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,049
assumption and the thing is that this

11
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,598
the proof side is very well rather long

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,910
so in our paper what we did is that we

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
actually consider it like the short

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,709
proof size setting and we kind of modify

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,469
the setting from DV next to designate

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,010
proven ni z k and pre-processing ni ZK

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,489
and we got short proof size by changing

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,750
the model a little bit and all these are

19
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,578
obtained through diffie-hellman type

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,620
assumptions and for the last one the

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,399
third result the pre-processing ni z k

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,828
we get this from the DDH assumption so

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,969
the first one is already done so what

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,580
we're going to be looking at is the

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:07,439
following item to an item 3 ok so let me

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,500
just tell you about the motivation a

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,119
little bit more so when we consider ni z

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,310
k's with proof sides which are

29
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,070
independent of the circus size see

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,810
computing this envy relation we actually

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,500
only know them from rather strong

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,500
assumptions such as IO fhe knowledge

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,710
assumptions and so on so the question is

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,090
if we don't really want to use these

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,658
kind of assumptions then what do we get

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,150
so without relying on these assumptions

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,030
we actually don't have a lot of really

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,740
compact proofs and well first of all the

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,869
deviations that we were talking about so

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,810
far it has to go through these FLS

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,649
transforms so it has a very long proof

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,960
size and the famous growth of Ostrovsky

43
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,149
Sahai and IC k has actually proof size

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,479
that is security parameters tying the

45
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,180
circuit size and as far as we know the

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,700
the shortest one without relying on the

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,799
strongest option is the crs misc of

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,119
growth in 2010 which is based on a

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,370
factoring based assumption and this has

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,189
proof size that is fully long poly log

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,000
lambda times the circuit size

52
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:22,090
so when you look at this all of these

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,829
well ni CK's proofs when you don't rely

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,780
on these stronger sumption z' we only

55
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:27,700
get multiple Oh what we get is a

56
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,950
multiplicative overhead in this circus

57
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,140
sized scene so the question is can we

58
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,738
make this additive and this is what we

59
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,629
did in this work so we construct a

60
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,500
designated prover and a pre-processing

61
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,260
enigk

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,060
based on well falsifiable pairing or

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,638
pairing free group assumptions with

64
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,139
proof signs that are additive in this

65
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:51,189
circuit size so it's gonna be the circus

66
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:54,280
sides plus poly lambda so this is gonna

67
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,980
be the main thing that I'll be talking

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,569
about so as a recap well it might not be

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,849
a recap because nobody explained it so

70
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,828
far but uh the DP and P P and is what is

71
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,750
this so DP is sure for designated

72
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,810
approver ni z case it's the quite

73
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,480
opposite of D Venus so rather than the

74
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,799
verifier having this secret key the

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,608
prover is going to have the secret key

76
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,400
and a pre-processing ni z came this is

77
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:20,709
where it's a relaxation of GP and DV

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,019
where both of them have secret keys in a

79
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,169
pre-processing phase and after that they

80
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:30,940
can do ni z case as much as they want

81
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:32,829
and the reason why this DP NPP ni CK's

82
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,840
are kind of interesting is because there

83
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:38,829
was a very nice result by Kim Liu in

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,470
2018 crypto that showed that of from any

85
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:44,829
context hiding homomorphic signatures or

86
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,500
max you can convert them into a

87
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,540
designate prover or a pre-processing ni

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,639
z came so when it's a signature you get

89
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,400
a DP disk when it's a Mac when you get a

90
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,199
pre-processing at i zk so for the rest

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,329
of this talk I'll only be talking about

92
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,239
this context hiding homomorphic sensors

93
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,739
or Macs and so when we get this from a

94
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,290
different type of assumption then it

95
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:09,430
means that we get a DP and P penis from

96
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,888
that same assumption ok so what are

97
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,620
these homomorphic signatures or Mac so

98
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,349
let me explain this in a very informal

99
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,590
way so in this scenario the signer is

100
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:23,020
given a mess well the signer produces a

101
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:26,219
lot of message and a signature pair so

102
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,820
here it's w12 WK it constructs K

103
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,790
messages and case signatures and the

104
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,070
signer can just give this pairs of

105
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,200
signatures and message fares along with

106
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,540
this circus see and there's going to be

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,940
this public evaluator which constructs

108
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,780
and evaluated signature on this message

109
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,910
C of W so more formally what it means is

110
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,340
that the public evaluator is going to

111
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,470
homomorphic lis modify these signatures

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,630
and construct the Sigma C which is a

113
00:04:52,470 --> 00:05:00,510
signature on C W and we rely two types

114
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,900
of security guarantees for these

115
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,490
homomorphic signatures or max so

116
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,349
unfortunately I won't get into detail

117
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,680
but this is basically very similar to

118
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,030
seizure schemes unfortunately and at a

119
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,310
high level this provides you with

120
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,830
soundness when you converted into ni z

121
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,740
came and the other one is a little bit

122
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:23,070
more special and unique to this setting

123
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,930
its context hiding and what context

124
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,050
hiding tells you is that for an

125
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,720
evaluative signature CW and this Sigma C

126
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,390
pair this does not leak any information

127
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,380
of the original message W other than the

128
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,750
fact that it computes two CW and as you

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,760
can kind of see this is going to be very

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,440
important for zero knowledge because W

131
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,460
is going to be our witness and this

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,140
circus C is somewhat related to this

133
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,890
relay the circuit computing this NP

134
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,840
relation so with zero knowledge with

135
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,560
context hiding we get zero knowledge oh

136
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,570
and I forgot to tell but uh when this CW

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,180
and Sigma see the evaluate signature if

138
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,190
it can be verified publicly then it's a

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,630
homomorphic Center scheme otherwise it's

140
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:13,410
a homomorphic Mak and finally on what

141
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:16,380
Kim woo showed is that on if for all N

142
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,530
c1 circuits this homomorphic Center or a

143
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,719
Mac outputs a homomorphic well evaluate

144
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,239
signature that is size poly lambda so

145
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,950
which is independent of the circuit then

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,200
by going through this chemical

147
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,510
transformation while you get is a ni ZK

148
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,510
with proof size which is a circus size

149
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,000
plus poly lambda so in the end our goal

150
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,030
is getting a homomorphic center or a Mac

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
which has a proof size with which has a

152
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,448
value

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,940
singer size independent of this nc1

154
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:48,900
circuit size so if we get that then we

155
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,639
get our goal and this brings us to our

156
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,090
first result we got a new homomorphic

157
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,520
Center scheme which as I said implies a

158
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,770
DP ni z came and this is going to be a

159
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,139
compact morphix changers for nc-1

160
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,969
circuits based on a new non-static

161
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,419
diffie-hellman type assumption which is

162
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,430
secured in the generate group model and

163
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:11,549
the core idea is that we view the

164
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,370
simulator used in certain key policy a b

165
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,260
e schemes I mean the simulator used in

166
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,840
these key policy a B security proofs as

167
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,930
am impressed homomorphic signatures I

168
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,510
will explain this in the next slide so

169
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,990
after that we construct a new key policy

170
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,900
a b e with constant size secret keys and

171
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,840
this will lead us to this compact more

172
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,950
fixed ranger scheme so a little bit more

173
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,479
in detail a very high-level

174
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,490
understanding of this is that so let's

175
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,580
consider the proof of a selective secure

176
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,320
security of an a b e steam so in this

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,080
scenario what happens is that the

178
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,590
adversary outputs this this X star this

179
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,180
target attribute to the simulator and

180
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,919
this a B simulator is supposed to

181
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,870
simulate the real world Challenger right

182
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,200
now so what it does what it does is that

183
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,360
it generates this simulation trapdoor

184
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,300
which is related to this target

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,130
attribute X star and it also produces

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,039
this public parameter and provides the

187
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:15,060
public prime to the adversary and the

188
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:17,130
adversary can query any circuit that

189
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,190
does not satisfy this target attribute

190
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:23,700
and he'll be able to get this secret key

191
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,830
C because it's the secret key query so

192
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,260
the simulator is going to use this

193
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,719
simulation trapdoor T DX star to

194
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,870
simulate this sk c and provides it back

195
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,529
to the adversary and the thing is this

196
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,120
is our main observation is that this

197
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,760
simulation trapdoor TD X star we can

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,020
kind of view this as a signature on this

199
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,689
message X star and we can view this

200
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,400
process of simulating this secret keys

201
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,700
sk c as evaluating on this trapdoor the

202
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,780
seemly

203
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,610
trapdoor TDX star on this circus scene

204
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,610
because the adversary can only query for

205
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,650
a circuit which satis satisfy the CX

206
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,980
star equals zero it kind of tells you

207
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,680
that the secret key is an invalid

208
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,550
signature for a circuit which satisfies

209
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,979
CX R equals zero and through this kind

210
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,410
of way of observing these security

211
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,170
proofs we construct new homomorphic

212
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,230
Center schemes and since these skc these

213
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,780
seeker keys are the evaluators signature

214
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,040
when the seeker keys are succinct when

215
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,000
they're compact then it ends in a very

216
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,589
compact homomorphic Center scheme and

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,200
this is our second result so this we

218
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,760
construct a new homomorphic Mac and as

219
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,520
again this results in a pre-processing

220
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,170
and IC came and I won't get into details

221
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,120
but this we construct a compact

222
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,910
homomorphic Mac for arithmetic circuits

223
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,610
of fully bounded degree based on the DDH

224
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,819
assumption very weak assumption and this

225
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,610
includes nc1 circuits and the core idea

226
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,620
is that we transform this information

227
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,570
theoretically secure non context hiding

228
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,090
homomorphic Mac by Catalonia and fiora

229
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,660
into a context hiding homomorphic Mac

230
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,190
using this special extractable fe for

231
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,130
inner products so functional encryption

232
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,750
schemes for inner products IP Fe so we

233
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,000
can forget about this extractable part

234
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,210
through this tactical technical overview

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,580
but basically if we instantiate this IP

236
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:27,360
Fe based on the DDH based construction

237
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,750
of Agra labert and steal it from 2016 we

238
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,860
get our context hiding homomorphic map

239
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,300
from the DDH assumption and this again

240
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,030
is a very high level overview of a

241
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,280
result - so how did Catalano if you are

242
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,189
gettin on context hiding homomorphic max

243
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,430
this is a review so there the secret key

244
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,760
was just a vector of ZP elements and to

245
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,859
sign on a message WI what it does is

246
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,200
that it just outputs a signature Sigma I

247
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,790
which satisfies that kind of relation R

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:03,360
I equals WI plus Sigma s and to evaluate

249
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,110
on this this function f which is degree

250
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,089
D

251
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,620
what it does is that this

252
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,829
if at least signature is just gonna be

253
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,449
that vector c1 through CD where the

254
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:18,878
c-130 D is actually a coefficient of the

255
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,769
function that's well the polynomial that

256
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,779
is evaluate on the right hand side and

257
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,800
as you can kind of compare with the

258
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:30,100
above line you can see that well without

259
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,019
the knowledge of R and s the secret are

260
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,360
NS you could still compute the CIS

261
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:37,059
because this season C C J's are a

262
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,019
function only of this w and Sigma which

263
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,709
are public right now

264
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,800
and to do this verify evaluation

265
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,930
algorithm this verification algorithm

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,029
the verifier just computes this fr and

267
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,420
checks whether that polynomial that

268
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,370
equation holds or not and the reason why

269
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,559
this is not context hiding is because

270
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,540
this ivalice signature which is this c1

271
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,550
through c d may leak information of the

272
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,550
original message w because as I said the

273
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:07,569
C 1 to C D are a function of this w and

274
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,550
the Sigma e now so our main observation

275
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,128
here like how to fix this into a context

276
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,719
hiding Mac homomorphic Mac is that when

277
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:16,240
you actually view this verification

278
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,329
algorithm the verifier only needs to

279
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,910
know that summation of this CJ to s J

280
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,899
and it doesn't need to know these

281
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,699
individuals c1 through C D so what we do

282
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,470
is that we use a functional encryption

283
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,420
scheme for inner products to kind of

284
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,269
solve this problem so we're going to

285
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:37,059
modify this evaluation of the signature

286
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:39,670
so we're gonna output this evaluate

287
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,379
signature as an encryption of this

288
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,790
vector so you want to see D so we're not

289
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,230
going to output this you want to see D

290
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,059
in the clear we're gonna encrypt it

291
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,230
using this IP Fe and to verify this what

292
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,420
we're going to do is that we're going to

293
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,910
provide as this secret key for this

294
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,179
verifier we're going to provide him with

295
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:01,269
this s2 SD vector and we're going to

296
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:04,240
provide this key for this inner product

297
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,429
functional encryption scheme so what we

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,740
can do now is that the verifier can just

299
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:12,730
run this decryption algorithm for this

300
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:15,879
IP Fe and it will get back that that

301
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,250
summation that I write in the red box on

302
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,779
top

303
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,390
and since the verifier never learns

304
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,430
these individuals c12 CD we can argue

305
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,620
through this IP fe that elites no

306
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,250
information of these c12 CD and it

307
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:34,329
becomes context hiding and here since we

308
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,070
can use the DD h based I P Fe this just

309
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,899
provides us with a home or if exchanger

310
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:42,130
scheme based on the DD h assumption and

311
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:45,550
that ends my session and now session

312
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:48,820
like my part and any questions yeah any

313
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:58,300
questions to the last speaker as well as

314
00:13:48,820 --> 00:14:01,420
to previous speakers alright I see

315
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,680
you're eager for the reception now let's

316
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:10,790
talk the speakers

317
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:10,790
[Applause]
