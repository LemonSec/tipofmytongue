1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:09,260
Thanks so I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,399
privacy on vacation again the active

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,000
confessori and the content proof

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,449
innovator and once again this is joint

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,448
work with the vehicle coming Joe and Tom

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,289
Thomas Vedic so what is pervasive

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,570
invocation

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,730
well privacy invocation is a protocol

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,520
where Alice and Bob share some weekly

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:36,090
create eggs and they won't we trade so

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,960
using for should uniform and and key are

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,469
and in a passive case there is the

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,250
basserive here that has a koala has a

14
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,559
side of every about the shirt really

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,350
nice legs and the Evo's all seized

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,419
everything passed between Alice and Bob

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:01:00,480
this can be done by strong unity traitor

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,510
and strongly Secretary's determination

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,479
so the function takes the render so sex

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,340
in attending phone and see what and the

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,189
one who hope for this on uniform in a

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:16,290
bit and you trade all who should be

23
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:21,508
close to to unifor condition the greener

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:25,680
seed and website information e so how do

25
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,080
these to help us to pay see if provision

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:35,520
invocation we're a little past the arena

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:39,060
see why to Bob so because the output NLA

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,640
post approval each way the output of X

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,460
again we should respect to Y as the

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,280
agency and because the arena sees is the

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,630
over and incantation wiping no so this

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,189
will the extra helper will be doing the

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,199
with respect to what you know and what

34
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:04,439
about active adversary

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:08,280
well activist a bursary can change Y to

36
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,220
some wiper now equal to Y so this breaks

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,690
the previous construction but and these

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,900
case has been study allowed classically

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,720
and usually these kept me down with too

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,410
long protocol but today's week and the

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,280
protocol use contraction core normally

42
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:32,680
betrayed her and that's why we started

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,130
eating this work and about the Conan

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,020
case

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:41,950
well the calling case of active corner

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:45,040
of the Visser II still have the power to

47
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:49,230
change Y to Y prime but now also the

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,660
sentiment is the corner state and this

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:57,640
scenario calm naturally when you try to

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:01,600
run on quantum protocol like qkd and our

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,809
resort is we control the first privacy

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,630
of Education Protocol secure against

53
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:14,080
contact evil adversary and this is done

54
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:17,260
by running to this week and contract

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,680
first squad improve normally above each

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,929
creature and against the weak point of

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,459
our protocol is that we have rather had

58
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:29,260
mean entropy Department the number of

59
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,950
the me a trophy needs to be bigger than

60
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:36,220
over two bits

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:40,209
okay so let's see how the DW all night

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:43,090
protocol runs so this is the DW on a

63
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,020
protocol he starts I hope you can see

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,230
starts here

65
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,080
so first L is used an arbitrator and the

66
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:55,299
same for reason from you Univ only read

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,720
my way and he trades on K then she pays

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,750
the pendency and leave my changes I

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,800
loose my upfront and above each trait

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,250
okay prior by that wife right then Bob

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,290
simple another unwritten cyb and I used

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,380
to make my systems and education code

73
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,890
use these capers the keys will make and

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,079
a paste

75
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:22,810
YV and take back then even might change

76
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,090
Y B and T to another why before in a

77
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,030
teapot there

78
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:33,539
and then a little trick will make match

79
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,419
and if it doesn't match then sure Jake I

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,300
was positive then using a strong traitor

81
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:43,710
to each trade X with y be playing the YB

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:47,580
so what is secure so let's discuss is

83
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:50,159
into Kate's first is if y equal YB y for

84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,520
then just because electricity had a

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,389
deterministic function then K well you

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,549
called the white Cape right so listen

87
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,900
Bob will have the same key on their make

88
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:11,520
and the security just guaranteed by the

89
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:14,849
make for the ball if change Y to Y Prime

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,760
well now we have some problems so we

91
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,789
have some cape on here that might depend

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,969
on K bus different from K and there's

93
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:26,039
all those laws to make has different key

94
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,289
that might be related with each other in

95
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,760
the make a truly cannot guarantee

96
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,419
security in this case that's why we need

97
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,419
nominee by a traitor

98
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:41,099
so normally boy treasurer is very

99
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:44,700
similar to a traitor except that the

100
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:48,960
lavatory also known know the ureter

101
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:53,250
opposed to some different seed wiper so

102
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:57,210
Y prime is a see that you can choose so

103
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,490
instead of just condition while Yi equal

104
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,479
police uniform you also need to

105
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:09,510
condition while frying the each racer

106
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:12,630
and resolve Wi-Fi no if no no that we

107
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,750
know this is a non-member trader here so

108
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,449
K for K will be uniform is respect to

109
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,340
okay so capable and okay are kind of

110
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,550
independent so this is nice

111
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:29,010
make him working in this way Oh mother I

112
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:34,050
give ya so they were bored if Y change

113
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:37,590
the Wi-Fi and how about a content

114
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,050
security well the previous work prove

115
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,719
that

116
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:47,780
dw9 protocol is the cure also in Conan

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,310
case but didn't achieve a for privacy

118
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,979
amplification against active

119
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:57,050
conservatory because they didn't control

120
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:00,740
the wo burg traitor correctly so we'll

121
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,660
focus on Amedeo portraiture so what is

122
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,440
the corner proven on each paper actuator

123
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:11,660
and the wise is hard

124
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:16,040
well the biggest problem is Aoife here

125
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:20,330
so remember you can produce the

126
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,630
wavefront as you wish and of course

127
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,310
you're going to what we will do is we

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,890
will do a measurement all the

129
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:31,690
information so that's the content state

130
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,250
II and the seed wavefront here but

131
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,070
remember the the basic function Lincoln

132
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,050
says if you do a measurement then your

133
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,469
contest cycle face to collapse to

134
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:47,500
something else so evil clips to another

135
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:51,170
contest a Ypres and so what you want to

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,270
about your filter is instead of

137
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,710
conditioned on either alpha being

138
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,430
uniform you should be conditioned on

139
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,870
April and the opera is uniform but

140
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,240
that's a big problem because you cannot

141
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,100
count the Johnny anymore and the carnage

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,650
on Ypres you will lose the independence

143
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,150
between x and y and the treasure always

144
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,530
needs the independence between the input

145
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:17,630
so this is a page talk more about this

146
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,020
so classically scientific measuring is

147
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,690
not a big problem because people with

148
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,789
conditional set information being some

149
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,270
value and the x and y are independent

150
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:32,450
and nice but the in quantum K is C

151
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:35,480
viewing condition in the x and y 90

152
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:39,730
printer you can be triggered by easy

153
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:43,670
classical case of ETA equal to 0 so e e

154
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:45,770
plus y and if you know quantum Marco

155
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,740
telling myself maybe we can use some

156
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,279
alcohol champ structures who argue for

157
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,550
independence between x and y which why

158
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,699
bon jour combination lay you're not

159
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,430
quantum Alcoa fishing or they live

160
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:04,910
trivial information so please don't cut

161
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,489
work here and so we bypass this problem

162
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:12,980
by exploding the inner product structure

163
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:16,309
of the twelve the Nama debug traitor

164
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,800
control by lee and actually use this for

165
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,899
me by use this structure two different

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,019
points and that is also done by a

167
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:28,160
reduction to communication key so let's

168
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:31,490
talk about normal by traitor of e lee so

169
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,269
the traitor has religious info for just

170
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,399
look at this

171
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:42,470
so x is a vector of t elements over F

172
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:46,430
key Y is the vector of T over 12 ml / p

173
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,339
FP unless you are doing squirrel and

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,969
it's over if key to a tea / - so the

175
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:56,029
table here is connect concatenation so Y

176
00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:01,519
and the y Y square combinations together

177
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,879
that's also in FTO FP 2 t so those are

178
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,639
nice

179
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:11,540
so in the bracket also is inner product

180
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:14,779
so output is element F key so the

181
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,730
classical intelligence this we see in a

182
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,019
Prada is a cool - sausage traitor and

183
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:23,209
we're also a traitor

184
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:25,879
obviously is not there is a really

185
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:28,069
simple take that's just Y prime is

186
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:35,029
linear function of y y prime equal to F

187
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:37,250
Y then you Kokua the the each without

188
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,069
proved against wiper and the easily by

189
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:45,620
linearity is just eight times the output

190
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:47,750
of Y so this but we want this to be cosa

191
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,319
Buena for conditioned on this so

192
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:54,679
obviously is not true but we say maybe

193
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:56,509
is just linear founder in space so we

194
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,009
encode why - something nonlinear maybe

195
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:05,269
this will be and outmaneuver each waiter

196
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:06,160
and that works so the series again so

197
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:12,069
this is a

198
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:16,850
not my liberator one upwards County area

199
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:20,089
over Y prime is uniform so first step is

200
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:24,709
use these excellent mother says if

201
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:28,999
there's a z0 plus AZ is closer uniform

202
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:31,758
for a then z 0 condition z is close to

203
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:35,660
be uniform conditions e and that's just

204
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,759
match things together so Z 0 is that my

205
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,649
treetop wooden disease

206
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:44,720
hopefully with y prime so these size

207
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:48,110
looks close to what we want to prove so

208
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,959
we wanted need to prove this I and this

209
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,480
I know is where we use in a powder

210
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:59,059
structure so if you just plug it was

211
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,149
what's the process here you have this

212
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:04,368
nice structure of legs even further with

213
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:08,119
X and the function of y and y prime here

214
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:11,329
there's a really nice foam here so we

215
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:13,369
reduce our problem to approve this inner

216
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:18,589
product is whole thing is costing

217
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:21,470
uniform and what our second step well so

218
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:24,350
first we do some notation to make things

219
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,990
easier so they'll say this hosting is

220
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,959
just a function G sub a of y and y prime

221
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:34,610
and it's really too sure with some

222
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,920
algebra solving polynomials and you will

223
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,559
see this is at most two to one function

224
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,649
so this function only there was one bit

225
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:47,480
of entropy from Y so this is one piece

226
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:49,790
of entropy then so three has lots of

227
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,459
entropy and X can also have lots of

228
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:57,049
entropy and because it's a secret here

229
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:59,839
you can eat trace on Britney salt so

230
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:03,139
what about contents 18 well for the

231
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:07,759
first day we want to do the linear for

232
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:10,549
my soul mr2 again well there is no no

233
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,189
quantum proof and on the uniform so

234
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:15,350
lemma proof so we prove it also it will

235
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:17,370
prove to a solar mass whence this

236
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,600
individual is there is

237
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:25,200
No - no - register X naught and X is

238
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,810
just X and you say X inner product with

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,460
a score of only X is close to beautiful

240
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,890
oh so the quantum part is that now the

241
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,600
the information here is our content

242
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,770
stays yeah

243
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,260
so we proved it was 2x Olema and how we

244
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,150
prove the quantity so lemma is by

245
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,340
generalizing a castle proof based on

246
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,890
collision probability so we define a

247
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,230
content sorry so use the content

248
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:55,680
collision poverty which is defined by

249
00:13:52,230 --> 00:14:00,240
TSS data so this is the chronically term

250
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:04,500
probability formula looks quite

251
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:08,120
complicated but the case we use is where

252
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:12,860
a is the classical register and give up

253
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:16,130
Sigma V is just Rho P so okay this is

254
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,660
more manageable and you can prove that

255
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,150
the conditional probability gamma C is

256
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:30,660
actually less than 1 so you feel more

257
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:33,420
comfortable T and yeah and as a sanity

258
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,060
check if you also peel pull the bead

259
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,099
register as classical and will reduce to

260
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:43,560
the classical collision probability so

261
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:47,310
sum of RPG Square and so the cool

262
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,760
properties of this thing is first there

263
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:53,040
is the bond between with everything it

264
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,069
is a bond between one know in a to know

265
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,260
so the transients were uniform and the

266
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,660
collision probability in here found each

267
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,660
other and this is like a cauchy schwarz

268
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,839
thing and also we can just expand the

269
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:11,490
middle turn this is a easy equation to

270
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:15,470
check so a quick sketch of how you prove

271
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,880
it and erase all mi is that says is

272
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:21,420
remember we want to prove that this is

273
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,510
true and that is true so that's a inner

274
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,380
product with X is Z so first we start

275
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,100
with the first dancer of

276
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,650
the tool uniform and we use the first

277
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:37,690
equation to get out to a bounder on

278
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:40,150
collision probability then he was saying

279
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,860
we're trying to expand its algebra then

280
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,030
you go to collision probability of X

281
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,670
then you just use the first equation

282
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,370
again to get the bounder tricity answers

283
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:56,680
likes you prove this and approval an

284
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:59,830
argument for why is similar okay so we

285
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,469
proved we success in your first

286
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:06,010
comparison to get this equation we want

287
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,190
to prove the point still here in this

288
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,920
duo breaking independence and that's

289
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:15,070
really annoying so how would you always

290
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,219
ypres to be careful the analysis is

291
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:22,570
independent of everything no that's too

292
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,520
complicated so it show you is how about

293
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:28,450
I'll try and I'll talk about it oh yeah

294
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,689
that's much easier so this is done by a

295
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:34,510
reduction to communication gear and the

296
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,190
this reduction of quantum proving

297
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,400
traitors who communication game is

298
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,470
actually quantum , and I like to think

299
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,420
that is for similar reason

300
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,910
okay so how does the communication work

301
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,120
communication game work so remember we

302
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,030
want to prove this thing the inner part

303
00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:01,060
of X and G is close to uniform well the

304
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:05,050
idea is TVs it's kind of a negation

305
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,480
proof so prove a contradiction so it is

306
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,339
easy to distinguish from a uniform and

307
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,829
it's kind of easy to case the exact

308
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,829
value of this thing of course is a

309
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:18,819
factor of pillows but please look sighs

310
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,849
so it's okay here so we change all codes

311
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,020
who gets the value of the inner product

312
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:28,060
and we enter everything into

313
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,950
communication yeah so what you can do

314
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:34,419
you can get a certain informational ear

315
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,790
box so we have a little holder X and the

316
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,820
sender or content information he out to

317
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,300
Bob and Bob knows and even those wise or

318
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,850
Bob

319
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,340
why and Eve can produce the weapon

320
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,100
Agricole why soul pub will also upload

321
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,760
the website and even need to get the

322
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,510
inner part of X energy so bub I'll put

323
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,680
in half a century with respect loss my

324
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:03,160
prior output and now we successfully had

325
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,190
Libra Inferno is just the internal

326
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:10,030
variable of calculation of Bob and is

327
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:12,790
not a novice Lee also his father and

328
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,050
although this is the relational

329
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,840
communication problem

330
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,389
so the yugioh communication problem will

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:23,439
be alias and Bob want to compute the

332
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:26,710
function f and f of xny but now Bob get

333
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,230
to choose this weapon so he can almost

334
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:34,930
Pokkiri there multiple correct answers

335
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:37,540
he became hopeful no we reduced with

336
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:41,080
communication game but how do we

337
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:45,159
boundaries the idea is use the inner

338
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,870
product structure here again and so we

339
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,010
can just apply Fourier transform to

340
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,159
which contracts

341
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:55,080
but if Bob can reconstruct X then X

342
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:00,160
cannot have too much entropy condition E

343
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:03,699
so as a toy model say is about one to

344
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,430
two communication can in a part of UNIX

345
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,340
in Y and to make it even easier than say

346
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:12,040
that we have to so inner product is just

347
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,760
in a Prada be string of events for

348
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:19,690
middle east with so if Bob can calculate

349
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,720
X in a part of Y for y then obviously he

350
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,880
can control this circle of white who

351
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,480
might want to exceed a father with Y

352
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,570
then pub can calculate X is the yezi's

353
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,270
so he prepared the universe

354
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,220
superposition of everything then apply

355
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,120
this Oracle so you know for

356
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:44,770
superposition times the minus one to

357
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:50,530
wake star Y then if you just hit Maha

358
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:53,320
cubits the bubble recover ik X and so

359
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,250
that's a toy model because the real

360
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,970
model you need

361
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,360
change f2 back to LP and you need to

362
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,130
think about what I do and above all

363
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,020
succeed everything actually well

364
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,190
consider on low success probability of

365
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,530
our P plus epsilon and the input is over

366
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,780
uniform Y but if you check out my

367
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:17,080
everything works out and we can get a

368
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:21,340
bound on the me entropy of X conditioned

369
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,340
on e the depend on the success of power

370
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,580
VD over this protocol look well based on

371
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,459
here and also this over to that get

372
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,289
carried to everywhere entropy search

373
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,960
whole and they with respect to

374
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:39,520
everything you go here prove a security

375
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:44,470
of the not married by traitor okay so a

376
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:47,440
quick summary we give the first purpose

377
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,059
invocation Protocol secure against

378
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,220
quantity ps3 by doing a PI controller

379
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:59,379
quanta improvement on my Voyager and all

380
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,039
a traitor has me entropy requirement of

381
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,400
bigger than over two bits so obvious

382
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,470
future question will be can we come to

383
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,470
Agra now my boy trader with entropy

384
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,470
breaking these over to search for yeah

385
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:18,750
so thank you

386
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:22,350
[Applause]

387
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,350
any questions

388
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:35,850
and so I mean just one quick question

389
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:40,970
like so you proved that this number e

390
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:44,639
able extractor is Quentin proof like

391
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:48,390
what would the typical t be if you will

392
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,200
try to prove like some other nama

393
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,450
malleable extractor is Quentin proof so

394
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,580
I think this can be answering to

395
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:02,190
duration why is extend already existing

396
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,760
trade her in the proof to quanta and why

397
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:09,300
is generalizes nice to other educators

398
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,460
so the existing treasures the I guess

399
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,990
the most popular one is the alternating

400
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,160
sections and a lot depends culturally

401
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:21,260
conditioned sending information things

402
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:25,380
are independent and as we talked about

403
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,270
we'll just change each we pray and we

404
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,360
don't have quite have a way to do with Z

405
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:35,760
power and the other thing is extending

406
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:38,250
our work to other things as I said we

407
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,940
use the inner product structure here are

408
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:49,230
two points so first one is we use these

409
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:52,770
and X Olimar to compress the variables

410
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:57,410
and loved-one things hard to generalize

411
00:22:52,770 --> 00:23:01,139
to other case the other place we use is

412
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,820
easy to do construction and to ponder

413
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,230
the communication getting that seems to

414
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,800
be doable we try hard enough

415
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:12,140
but I sold him a policy is pretty hard

416
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,139
to generalize yeah

417
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:20,019
let's thank the speaker again

418
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,019
[Applause]
