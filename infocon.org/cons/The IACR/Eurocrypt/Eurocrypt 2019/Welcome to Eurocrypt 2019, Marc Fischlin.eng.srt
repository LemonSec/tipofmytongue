1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,740
good morning everyone I would like to

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:14,969
welcome you to Europe of 2000 Europe

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,430
2019 in damage that this is the 38th

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,310
edition of your Crypt I see our

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,060
conference and for sure it's one of the

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,460
biggest one so yesterday we had 547

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,259
registrations and I just was just

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,710
notified that we have actually two more

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:37,649
this morning so it's 549 now and the

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,469
noteworthy fact about this is that we

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,559
almost have 40% student registrations so

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,379
we're looking into a bright future and

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,660
in case you happen to be around on

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,949
Saturday and Sunday the number of

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,550
registration was even topped by the

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,570
number of workshop participants in total

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:02,099
8 631 workshop participants roughly 300

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,709
on each of the two days now organizing

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,840
such an event is not there's not a

20
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,929
single person you can manage to do this

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,330
and I must thank all my team my research

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,350
group most of them lined up there or to

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,189
the left

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:23,548
[Applause]

25
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,038
and there's one particular person I need

26
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,929
to especially thank and this is unclear

27
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,069
personal she's the person sitting answer

28
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,069
at the registration desk

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,009
so she made my life tremendously much

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,200
simpler she negotiated contracts in case

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,570
you need an invitation letters you

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,340
probably got an email from her she was

33
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,800
responsible for the catering and all

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,320
these things and she did a marvelous job

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,780
and I'm very happy that she supported us

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,419
here now we'd also like to thank my

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,770
workshop chairs

38
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,350

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,259

40
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,060

this event

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,790
this is funding which goes into for

52

example travel support for students let

53
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,560
me just highlight two of our diamond

54
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,150
sponsors one is the our collaborative

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,220
research center here in Darmstadt

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,730
Crossing and the other one is the host

57
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,990
Kurt's foundation for the generous

58
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:06,690

59
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:09,310
[Applause]

60
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,109
now about the conference you will notice

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,850
that basically almost everything is

62
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,670
happening in here in this damn stadium

63
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,530
conference center for example even the

64
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,780
lunches will take place outside of these

65
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,569
buildings even in the behind the wall of

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,769
this room there will be seating during

67
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:32,738
lunch so in fact you can think about

68
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:34,540
everything is in here now the talks of

69
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,760
track a and all of the joint sessions

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,429
like this one here this will happen in

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,970
this room this is called spectrum for

72
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,280
example the invited talks the best paper

73
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,049
talks the membership meeting the ICR

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,130
membership meeting on Wednesday this

75
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:53,560
will all happen here and then we have

76
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,500
track P track P will happen in the

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,260
Ferrum lecture hall which is if you

78
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,660
leave there and you go up the stairways

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,160
and if you want to visit the first

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,650
session of track B I think you should

81
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,799
follow Vincent because he's supposed to

82
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,829
go there and share the session there now

83
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,670
this is only on Monday and Tuesday

84
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:17,108
basically we were lucky to switch

85
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,399
because we got is such an high number of

86
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,640
registration you switched to a bigger

87
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,539
room but on Wednesday and Thursday we

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,969
are in a different room called titanium

89
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:30,969
which is if you pass theorem and keep on

90
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:35,680
walking then you'll find this room so

91
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:38,440
this is on Wednesday and Thursday now on

92
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,110
Tuesday we have to ramp session this is

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,700
chaired by Dan Bernstein Tonya Langer if

94
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,200
you follow the link on the homepage of

95
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,280
the uroclub homepage you can actually

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,219
now submit paper

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,789
or proposals should not say papers

98
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,960
proposals for talks for the rump session

99
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:58,510
and I think the dead ends tonight at

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,599
9:00 p.m. on Wednesday we have the

101
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,380

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,880
happen in Frankfort and the buses will

103
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,800

124
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,440
that crowded at this point but because

125
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,210
of the high number of registrations this

126
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,640

side so I hope you enjoyed the

135
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,400
