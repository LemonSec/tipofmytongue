00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Thank You bud so today I will talk about

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:12,420
format preserving encryption or IPE so

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,330
epi is widely used in practice to

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,670
encrypt credit numbers are fields in

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,890
legacy databases in those systems the

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,369
data have to follow some certain format

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,670
dictated by the schema if you use an

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,809
ordinary encryption scheme then you will

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,559
destroy the format and crash the system

10
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:39,629
in contrast under a PE cyber attacks

11
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,089
will always have the same format as the

12
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,980
plaintext

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,190
for example if you encrypt a credit card

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,480
number then the server tax will also

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,910
look like a credit card number

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,898
therefore using a a PE would avoid

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,599
disrupting the system so syntactical e

18
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,890
an epic scheme it's just a trickable

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,900
block cipher on the channel domain so an

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,630
epic scheme would take as input a key

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:16,439
and a twig to deterministically map

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:20,280
basis in the domain to a cemetery in the

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,000
same domain so why would one need twigs

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,340
to encrypt to understand the needs for

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,009
twig a let's consider following scenario

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,850
where we stop ready cut numbers in a

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,400
database in the first table we star the

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,929
customers names together with their

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,540
record numbers in a second table we star

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,729
the transaction numbers together with

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,110
the corresponding record numbers for the

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,229
purchase if you can buy the two tables

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:56,640
we can realize that John Doe made the

34
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,649
first and second transactions now

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,450
suppose we encrypt the crack at numbers

36
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:06,689
by a p/e under the same key into it

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,000
because epi is deterministic encrypting

38
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,889
the same message twice under the same

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,440
key and twig would result in the same

40
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,000
Sarah tax therefore

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,710
if you combine the two encrypted tables

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,840
you can still realize that John Doe made

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:27,750
the first and second transaction as

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:31,170
before in contrast if you encrypt the

45
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,240
two tables under different tweaks then

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,179
other one can do you realize that

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,850
transactions one and two will meet under

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,110
the same crack at number now there's no

49
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,700
way you can link that to channel anymore

50
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:49,770
therefore using Twix would improve

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,290
privacy in their context of a PE so

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:55,710
annoying obstacle in designing a P is

53
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,709
that but like conventional block ciphers

54
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:02,280
such as AES here the domain can be quite

55
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,920
small for example if you encrypt social

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:10,410
security numbers the domain size is just

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:14,250
about 2 to the 30 as I mentioned earlier

58
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,650
happy is wily used in practice and the

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,620
two importance that most important

60
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,370
schemes and these standards have F 1 and

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,450
F 3

62
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,830
both are based on feistel network

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,609
however there have been a number of

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,970
attacks on those standards for example

65
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,560
my prior work with me Larry and Stefano

66
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,140
Tesoro get a message recovery attack on

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,459
files two networks which applies to both

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,279
ff1 and ff2 e the attract is very

69
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,820
expensive and it just recovers a single

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,310
target messes on the plus side it is not

71
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,900
adaptive and it's very few known

72
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,150
messages between with Stefano and any

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,900
trio subsequently we improve the attacks

74
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,650
in some friends such as the amortized

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:12,150
with the complexity but training remains

76
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:15,510
as expensive as before so on a different

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,959
direction Dirac and voronet exploited

78
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,280
design but in FF 3 to recover the entire

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,770
code book the attack however is very

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,210
specific to FF 3 meaning that it doesn't

81
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,080
apply to

82
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,870
everyone moreover they need adaptive

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:39,599
queries so all attacks so far are

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,479
expensive requiring at least and repeat

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,949
operations where you attack remain the N

86
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,219
times VN so they are only suitable

87
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:52,440
aren't small domains but today I will

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,830
show you how to improve a DD attack to

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:00,090
reduce running time from and v 2 oboes

90
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,909
and Q so this the very first attack on

91
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,979
epic tree that is feasible on moderate

92
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,960
and large domains so there's a more

93
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:13,289
detailed comparison between our attack

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,289
and DV since I mentioned earlier for the

95
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,229
timing we are much better the two

96
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:22,860
attacks essentially have is the same

97
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,139
asymptotic data complexity but levy up

98
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,229
for a more aggressive choice of

99
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,620
parameters to improve the recovery rate

100
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:37,199
so concretely for data complexity our

101
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,789
attack is slightly better so before we

102
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,669
get into the technical details of the

103
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:45,180
attack let me briefly review the attack

104
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,400
notion that we are considering so our

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,880
attack it's just a chosen plaintext

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,929
attack that is the adversary is even an

107
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,659
encryption Oracle to query messages and

108
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,199
twix always choice to receive the

109
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:04,110
corresponding stable text to go of the

110
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,509
adversary he is very ambitious it wants

111
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,190
to recover the entire book on every to

112
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:14,880
ecstatic queries so this is a bird's eye

113
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,820
view of FF tree it is just an ice Ralph

114
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,120
ice to nettle the pictures here shows

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,250
for our face though but unlike

116
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,880
conventional feistel where the operator

117
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:34,440
is XR here we consider a generic abelian

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:38,190
group operator plus our tech works on a

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,570
chair Romain Z M times V n where m is

120
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,510
greater than n

121
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,990
and in contrast the DV attack only

122
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:51,090
consider the balance setting namely M is

123
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:53,850
equal to n so under a well-designed

124
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,890
Stono network then if you encrypt at a

125
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,250
different tweaks that encryption should

126
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:03,210
appear independent however in MF tree

127
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,600
for any 2t you can find a related to T

128
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:10,530
prime so that encryptions under these

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:13,590
twigs have some sort of similarity in

130
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:18,739
particular if inclusion a trick T is the

131
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:21,780
Cascade of two for a festival of F and G

132
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:27,030
that encryption under T prime is the

133
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,489
Cascade of G and F so this same is this

134
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,690
similarity allows one to mouth what is

135
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,420
known as sly attack by Alex blue note

136
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,340
and David Wagner

137
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,580
so in particular we first cry a pure

138
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,270
change and a quick TS follow so we start

139
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,150
at a random point u 0 and query that to

140
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,690
the inclusion oracle undertook T to get

141
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,719
a point you won we then who did you want

142
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:58,080
to the inclusion Arco under 2t again to

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,540
get another point YouTube and so on so

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,310
by repeating this process we obtain a

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,870
chance and the twig tea likewise we kind

146
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,800
of tell another chain and a trick T

147
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:14,880
prime for a random point Weezer

148
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,960
so here I am showing just one query but

149
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,370
weak but in the paper we can see there

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,099
sorry one change between but in the

151
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,450
paper we can exceed a multiple chains

152
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:30,780
for trick I'll go is that some chance

153
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,970
for 2t who some who eventually collide

154
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,120
and then merged with another chain or

155
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,750
the T Prime

156
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,130
note that the functions F and G here are

157
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,310
permutations because they are for our

158
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,439
first Oh therefore if collision does

159
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,849
happen and it must happen at the

160
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,850
beginning of some chain

161
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,400
if a change land is to pee and we use as

162
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:02,469
chance but Twix then we can consider s

163
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:06,189
square P positions for collision a true

164
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,980
collision would give us P pairs of known

165
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:12,910
plaintext attacks for F and G but we

166
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,770
don't know which boy is the true one so

167
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,680
essentially we have a situation of

168
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:21,579
needle in haystack so we have a haystack

169
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,189
of the MN instances but at most one of

170
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,900
them would give us the middle namely a

171
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:32,470
troop lesion so how would we find a

172
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:35,620
needle then so it's instructive to see

173
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,330
how dB managed to resolve this but

174
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,680
remember that they only consider the

175
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,840
balance setting where m is equal to n so

176
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,380
we first developed a codebook recovery

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:51,310
attack on for our face though with time

178
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:54,460
and cube then it used that on every

179
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,160
instance so if we can recover the

180
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,730
codebook on a particular instance that

181
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,709
must be a true instance so we are done

182
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,140
but if we fail to recover codebook on

183
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:09,760
some instance so that is probably a

184
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:13,449
false instant just recheck it so because

185
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:18,100
they are n square instances and X NIST n

186
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:21,340
cubed time so totally there we you need

187
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,630
n to the fifth running time so that is

188
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,930
expensive how can we do better so first

189
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,270
of all we call that B we use a expensive

190
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:35,380
loop recovery attack on every single

191
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,439
instance this wasteful because all but

192
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,810
one instances are false

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,590
so one better Phi a cheap distinguishing

194
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:48,729
attack to eliminate all of most of the

195
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:51,280
first instances first and then later to

196
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,490
run a codebook recovery attack on the

197
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,760
remaining one but even then it is

198
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,870
expensive because D is cook recovery

199
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,460
attack is expensive using n cubed time

200
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,470
so we therefore develop an improved

201
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,810
track you see

202
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:15,690
just and to the 5/3 time and it works in

203
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,310
a chair up case as well so because the

204
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,590
bottleneck of our attack is in a

205
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:24,119
distinguishing part so for the rest of

206
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,520
the talk I will focus on these spots but

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,080
before we get into the technical details

208
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,350
let's try to understand what is to be

209
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,690
quiet for the distinguishing attack so

210
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,130
here we are given P pairs of known

211
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,530
plaintext attacks for extra F and G so

212
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,600
the distinguisher has to tell whether

213
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,510
the cell attacks were produced in a

214
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,710
reward namely produced under a four-hour

215
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,720
feistel ah they will produce in the

216
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,620
random world namely by a random

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,180
permutation so in the real world we want

218
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,240
the distinguishes I put correctly with

219
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,400
high probability say half so there's

220
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,180
only a true instance there we can't

221
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,069
afford to miss that on the other hand in

222
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,260
the random world we want to distinguish

223
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,590
the output incorrectly with very very

224
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,790
small probability say in a proportional

225
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:20,790
to you about one of a squared M so Y

226
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:24,209
square root the reason is that we run

227
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:28,469
the test twice for instance one for F

228
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:31,410
and another for G so far for instance

229
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:35,490
the chance that you Inc really except it

230
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:38,610
would be at most one over m and if you

231
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,360
have m and false instances and

232
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,170
expectedly

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:49,980
they are accessible n instances that

234
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:52,410
survive the test so the key idea of our

235
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,560
attack is based on the fact that feistel

236
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:59,030
network exhibits some sort of bias when

237
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,160
you encrypt inputs of the same perhaps

238
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,100
in particular consider two inputs action

239
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,390
X pry that have a similar I have and for

240
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,640
convenience let me go to colliding so

241
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,089
let's now encrypt them under for our

242
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,300
feistel network and look at the

243
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:22,040
difference on

244
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,599
perhaps of the Sabbath tax CNC prime so

245
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,630
it turns out that the distribution of

246
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:32,150
this one picks at a point let's have an

247
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:34,550
axe - let's have an X prime the gap

248
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:38,270
between the pig and a uniform mass is

249
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:40,459
too small to explore directly but this

250
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,460
can be amplified if we have enough

251
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,570
plaintext attack pairs and for our

252
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,330
convenience

253
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:51,560
we'll call two pairs ax C and X prime C

254
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,780
price matching a the difference on the

255
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,280
left halves of the plaintext

256
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:02,000
it exactly that of a separate text so in

257
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,209
our track we call LHD would compute Q

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,900
the number two pairs of plaintext

259
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:12,770
attacks that are colliding now has also

260
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:16,790
questions what how many two pairs are of

261
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:19,069
those Q would be matching you would have

262
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,819
a different answers depending on whether

263
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,410
you either River are random world so in

264
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,930
particular there's a big gap between the

265
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:30,140
expected value diesel in the random

266
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:32,560
world and it's got a party one in a

267
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,750
reward

268
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,260
and this gap corresponds to the bias

269
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:43,160
that I mentioned earlier but now it is

270
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:47,569
amplified by effect of Q because we have

271
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,689
a Q two pairs so therefore we will set

272
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:55,810
up a trash shop as a weighted average of

273
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:59,500
these or anyone in the number of the two

274
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,239
matching pairs is beyond this threshold

275
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,540
we are probably in a real world and we

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,360
should have put 1 otherwise it is below

277
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:13,790
the threshold so we are probably in a

278
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:17,270
random world and we should output 0 so

279
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,380
how fast is test so the first class we

280
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:24,199
are given P pairs of plaintext attacks

281
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,960
so at best we probably can do at most

282
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,980
linear try on that but that is too slow

283
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,980
our purpose

284
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,199
to speed things up we develop a

285
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:38,540
pre-processing of MN time but this one

286
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,420
is little only once for all the

287
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,599
instances with this common

288
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:49,069
pre-processing we can spit the running

289
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,779
tap HD by almost effective n so this one

290
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,910
is somewhat fast but how good is that

291
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,980
so theoretically in the real world we

292
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:03,560
output correctly with priority at least

293
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:06,649
the past 38 when M and N greater than 64

294
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:11,089
and the bigger eminent are the better

295
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,800
about is in the random world there the

296
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:16,940
chance that we are put in correctly is

297
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,779
at most one over screwed of M astra

298
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,420
quite but let me stress that these

299
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,910
radical estimations are very very

300
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,760
conservative and empirically we do much

301
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:33,410
better so experiment shows that in the

302
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,319
real world we always output correctly in

303
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:41,260
the random world then we my output

304
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,260
incorrectly but that happens very rarely

305
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:52,459
so summing up today our text shows that

306
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:56,870
the ff3 bug discovered by DV is much

307
00:16:52,459 --> 00:17:00,469
more damaging than it was believed the

308
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:04,400
good news is that in life of all these

309
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,309
attacks finally nice decided to update

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,300
the specification of F F 1 and F 3 to

311
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:14,928
deal with them so if you use FF 1 or

312
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:19,540
even worse FF 3 in your system then it's

313
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:26,470
now time to update that's all thank you

314
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,470
[Applause]

315
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,680
the general a setup of having a very low

316
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,050
probability event which is a bit higher

317
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,740
than others and looking for the needle

318
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:48,290
in the haystack is exactly what was

319
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,580
analyzed in the paper we wrote several

320
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,540
years ago

321
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,460
I think they paired in crypto so you may

322
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,740
want to look at finding needles in

323
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,440
haystacks because they showed how to

324
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,060
trade off time versus space I believe

325
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,800
that your algorithm requires a lot of

326
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,770
space because the result of the

327
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:14,389
pre-processing has to be summarized in

328
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:19,879
some large table isn't it amen

329
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:21,770
yep amen so that I think that is not

330
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,810
that big yeah

331
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,840
so depending on how big you are I want

332
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,120
to be but for the one that we experiment

333
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,129
then spy is not the bottleneck but of

334
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,139
course if you want to go to very big

335
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,640
then yes you want some sort of tree up

336
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,620
there so then you may want to look at

337
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,990
that paper to see how you can use less

338
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,429
space in order to find needles in

339
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,430
haystacks Thank You Eddie

340
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:52,130
question over there so you show that you

341
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,110
exploit this algebraic relationship

342
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,050
between the tricks so you call with four

343
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,570
and then it turns out that it's you you

344
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,700
have a collision which is likely so do

345
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,379
you think there are other algebraic

346
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,690
relations that could be exploited there

347
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:11,210
or how do you know that like that's the

348
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:15,980
only one so at the moment so nice

349
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:17,780
restricted space so that you can so so

350
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,500
that you cannot mad escape attacks

351
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:25,190
anymore so at the moment we we don't

352
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:29,630
know any other way to break up every

353
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:32,780
year so but I cannot certain and a

354
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:36,200
certain that it is not free yeah

355
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:39,889
so it adds a burst cutie proof there

356
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,450
and they just the best we can offer and

357
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:43,939
if I have to waste from further trip

358
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,559
analysis and also you said that so you

359
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,120
showed that okay this attack is a

360
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,549
distinguishability attack really random

361
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,889
but and not clear to me how you how you

362
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,320
extract the message from from that okay

363
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:57,049
so the distinguishing attack it's just

364
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,629
to tell which instant is the true one

365
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,658
and then you actually have to need

366
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,760
another attack to extract the codebook

367
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,039
from that but I am not showing it here

368
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,350
because of that time constraint but I'm

369
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,549
happy to talk offline but that takes

370
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:20,360
like we do that takes like what how much

371
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:22,360
time it takes to let's see so in the

372
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,010
balance setting it's about end to the

373
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,769
fight cuts if the domain is the end

374
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,299
times the end so you so you actually but

375
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,700
do you need to actually to know that

376
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:33,260
you're in the real so you need to know

377
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,840
that you actually have the correct

378
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,299
instance because otherwise you just have

379
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:44,090
noise and you cannot extract anything

380
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:49,129
from noise the question for addy you

381
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:52,459
have time no problem that's why I waited

382
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,500
to say that no one else is asking em in

383
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,950
the first few slides you explained what

384
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,049
kind of information still leaks out and

385
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,510
explained why we need trickable know at

386
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,809
the beginning why we need tweakable

387
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,980
cryptosystems yes exactly so a proposal

388
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,100
i would like to make is the following

389
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,169
this will still leak out the information

390
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,990
that the first two transactions were

391
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,429
made by the same credit card number you

392
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,700
don't know who is the customer

393
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:21,799
but you link together and if something

394
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,840
will later be revealed about one of the

395
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:26,480
transactions it will link the other

396
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,510
transactions to it why don't you use the

397
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,539
time of the transaction as another

398
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,970
source of tweak so you are actually

399
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,980
going to encrypt the first transaction

400
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,710
and the second transaction if they were

401
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,240
made by the same credit card almost

402
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,090
certainly they were not made at the same

403
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,460
time the time remains unencrypted and

404
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,050
this will make the two credit card

405
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,430
numbers even though they were this below

406
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,919
to the same guy in the same credit card

407
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,770
number they will look like different

408
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,400
credit card numbers in the database yeah

409
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,860
I think that is not so if you use the

410
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,800
running a learn the timing then the

411
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,979
tweak will be different and the Celtics

412
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,710
would be different but it depends on how

413
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,660
practitioners we handle that I think

414
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,330
typically they only encrypt a part of

415
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:19,350
the crackit numbers and then use the

416
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:23,939
rest as tweaks so that money could get

417
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:26,669
as part of the tweak easily yeah number

418
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,850
say the four last stitches know the time

419
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,770
of the transaction yeah it's repaired it

420
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,219
will do that that would be good one as

421
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,590
well

422
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:39,390
but yeah okay suggestion okay I still

423
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,310
have a question so you didn't explain in

424
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,110
detail what nice changes only the tweak

425
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,370
space if she also treat the number of

426
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,709
rounds and you think it's a good idea

427
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:49,620
what I did actually let's see

428
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,080
so actually two changes because it asked

429
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,060
so many attacks so 202 twat the deviate

430
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,320
second house so they suggest that that

431
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,419
you actually have to restrict a quick

432
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,850
space so that you cannot now any cap

433
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:05,550
related tweaks anymore and second is to

434
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:10,590
restrict on a domain size so they don't

435
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:12,060
accept very tiny domain anymore so my

436
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,040
earlier work with permeable air is

437
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,889
Stefano Annie trio no longer applies

438
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,649
because it is very expensive thing so

439
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,740
basically now the domain size should be

440
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:27,300
at least 1 million previously they allow

441
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,620
a hundred ok there's no more questions

442
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,080
let's thank our speaker again thank you

443
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,979
very much

444
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,980
[Applause]
