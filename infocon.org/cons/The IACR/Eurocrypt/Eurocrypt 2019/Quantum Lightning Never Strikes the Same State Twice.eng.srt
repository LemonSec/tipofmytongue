1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,660
so this talk is going to basically be

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,110
concerned about no cloning so what is no

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,940
cloning or quantum no-cloning well what

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,549
we can consider is a hypothetical device

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,520
that takes as input an arbitrary unknown

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,759
quantum state and turns it into two cop

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,109
identical copies of the original state

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,640
classically this is easy so if you're

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,170
you know classical state is this a

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,570
string of ones and zeros you can just

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,330
read it and write it down twice but it

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,710
turns out with quantum information this

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,649
is actually impossible if you if you

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,969
truly know nothing about the input

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,600
quantum state there is no way to

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,820
actually create two copies so as a

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,350
cryptographer you know what I think of

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,989
when I think of no cloning is quantum

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,660
money so quantum money is basically the

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,269
you know the cryptographic application

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,959
of this and what it is is the following

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,940
so the the mint is going to basically

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,010
generate a random quantum state that's

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,839
going to be the bank note they're going

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,729
to keep a classical description of this

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,840
bank note privately to themselves and

27
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:13,140
then they'll they'll give out the

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,479
quantum state right so you know by

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,280
no-cloning when when you get this

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,619
quantum state you can't copy it so you

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,070
know it seems like we have a good a good

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,530
unforgeable money from this but the

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,490
problem is is that this plain quantum

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,520
money that I've described so far is

35
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:36,149
maybe not super useful in practice and

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,590
the reason is is that in order to let's

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,780
say you know mr. moneybags here has a

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,579
quantum bank note they want to go buy a

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,399
car they're going to give the bank note

40
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,658
to the dealership and the dealership is

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,670
going to say hey you know this is a

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,200
arbitrary quantum state how do I know

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,479
that this is the quantum state that came

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,899
from the mint versus you just came up

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,700
with your own arbitrary state so what

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,799
the dealership has to do is actually go

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,710
to the mint send them the bank note the

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,710
mint says you know yes this is this is

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,179
the bank note corresponding to the

50
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,829
private State if you know the actual

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,929
classical description of the state you

52
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,739
can verify and so then they'll send the

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,440
money back and say yeah it was the right

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,810
so with with this concept of quantum

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,700
money we don't have an analogue of you

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,290
know holding the note up to the light

57
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,739
and making sure there's a strip in there

58
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,780
and all the other features that we have

59
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,510
so what we really want out of a quantum

60
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,490
money scheme is public verifiability so

61
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,340
you know the analog of just holding the

62
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,820
bill up to the light so what we really

63
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,670
want is that a scheme where the serial

64
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,310
number can actually be made public and

65
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:47,359
so broadcast to everyone I know you just

66
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,790
verify relative to this serial number

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,400
and the hope is that security remains

68
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,470
that you know mr. mr. moneybags here he

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,050
knows the serial number he has a quantum

70
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,590
state that even then he still cannot

71
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,850
copy the quantum state

72
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,530
unfortunately the sort of original

73
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,359
proposal for quantum money is totally

74
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,070
insecure here if you know the serial

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,870
number it immediately tells you how to

76
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,120
construct arbitrarily many copies at the

77
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,300
quantum state but we can hypothesize

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,110
about the existence of of this better

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,060
object so really you know this notion of

80
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:25,820
public key quantum money is just it's no

81
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,470
cloning plus a verifiability aspect in

82
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,850
this talk I consider something maybe

83
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,730
even a little stronger

84
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,329
and to motivate this you know I had a

85
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,579
thrown blockchain or Bitcoin somewhere

86
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,670
so if we imagine a typical

87
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,220
cryptocurrency application the thing is

88
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,619
that with cryptocurrencies the the

89
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,080
people minting money are the same as the

90
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,390
people spending money and if you think

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,580
about it this presents a very big

92
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,950
problem that it you know how is the

93
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,690
person who's minting money going to be

94
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,299
how are we gonna prevent them from you

95
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,609
know just s-- minting multiple copies of

96
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,060
their money you know the cryptocurrency

97
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,360
solve this by keeping a public ledger of

98
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:12,110
all transactions but maybe we can use no

99
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,150
cloning in some way to to avoid this but

100
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,459
you see that what we need here is that

101
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,290
the we actually need security against

102
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,850
the person who makes the banknote in the

103
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,040
first place and so this is sort of the

104
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,930
motivation for the title of my talk

105
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,450
let me explain what the title of the

106
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,100
talk actually means so you know we have

107
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,050
this old adage about lightning never

108
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,000
strikes the same place twice let's

109
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,080
pretend it's actually true

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,970
Early's true in nature well we we know

111
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,859
actually it's not true if you tamper

112
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,700
with nature say by erecting a tall

113
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,910
building so this is the tallest building

114
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,590
in Europe it's somewhere in Russia and

115
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,820
we can see you know four pictures of

116
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,919
different lightning bolts striking the

117
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,440
buildings so you know clearly if we

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,230
tamper with nature lightning will strike

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,190
the same place twice so what does

120
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,750
quantum lightning it's a hypothetical

121
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,570
digital version of lightning that is

122
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,600
secure in the sense that no matter how

123
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,909
you tamper with the procedure for

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,050
generating the lightning in your wreck

125
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,460
the tall building when you know

126
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,040
essentially a lightning rod or whatever

127
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,190
you do to tamper with the procedure it

128
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,810
will still always output different

129
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,670
outputs every time and this is

130
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,500
impossible classically if you think

131
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,020
about it for a moment because you know

132
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,670
if you basically you can control the

133
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,750
initial conditions if you're thinking

134
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,130
about digital things you know just

135
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,540
always feed in the same randomness if

136
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,130
you're thinking about physical processes

137
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,050
you can control the initial conditions

138
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,790
in a laboratory environment so that

139
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,240
every time you carry out the process you

140
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,100
get the same result with quantum

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,020
information though maybe we can hope to

142
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,430
avoid this

143
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,340
as a sidenote so when I give this talk

144
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,230
in the u.s. I use the World Trade Center

145
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,549
the tallest building in the US so for

146
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,110
here I wanted to find the tallest

147
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,570
building in Germany and show four

148
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,220
pictures of lightning striking it

149
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,110
unfortunately I could only find one so

150
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,550
maybe Germany actually already is

151
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,980
invented quantum lightning I don't know

152
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,650
any case so quantum Lightning has

153
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,380
applications maybe public key quantum

154
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:23,109
money is a trivial one maybe it can give

155
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:26,990
decentralized currency without a without

156
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,670
the blockchain and also another

157
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,830
interesting application is that it

158
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,710
actually gives a way to certify that a

159
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,900
particular value has entropy basically

160
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,419
the the bolt is a proof that its serial

161
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,320
number has entropy and there's a

162
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:45,900
easy reduction showing this okay

163
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,849
so let's turn to constructions well

164
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,020
they're very few and far between

165
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,820
unfortunately there have been a few

166
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,260
constructions in the literature most of

167
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,710
which has been mostly which have been

168
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,690
broken and all of which are basically

169
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,880
the the underlying computational

170
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,600
assumption is we don't know how to break

171
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,860
this scheme and nothing really more

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,110
interesting than that no nothing based

173
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,660
on standard assumptions or even like a

174
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,720
nice simple to state assumption that can

175
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,870
be analyzed by cryptographers so the

176
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,190
purpose of this work is to try to remedy

177
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,840
the situation and give some new

178
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,240
constructions of quantum money quantum

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,330
Lightning that are maybe a little easier

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,070
to analyze and along the way we'll see

181
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,539
some interesting connections to post

182
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,480
quantum security which is security of

183
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,290
classical crypto in a quantum world so

184
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:39,670
yes let me take that detour now so a

185
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:41,380
seemingly completely unrelated topic is

186
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,080
is the following

187
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,050
so consider commitment scheme in

188
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,820
particular bit commitments you know we

189
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,360
all know that this these consists of a

190
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:55,290
commit phase in a reveal phase where in

191
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,180
the commit phase after the commit phase

192
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,490
Bob learns nothing about the message but

193
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,360
in some sense we want that Alice is

194
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,100
bound to a particular message and then

195
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,770
only in the reveal phase does she does

196
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,300
she reveal what the message is so I'm

197
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,740
not gonna care about the hiding property

198
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,560
for this talk but the more interesting

199
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,140
case for us is binding so what we want

200
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,800
is that an adversarial Alice who engages

201
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,409
in the commit phase at least the the

202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,100
classical way we define security is that

203
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,290
after Alice carries out the commit phase

204
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:33,990
she can then what she has to do is try

205
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,990
to commit simultaneously to both 0 and 1

206
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,690
so but I we need to take a moment tack

207
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,720
to think about this definition so the

208
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:47,020
security goal is that Alice after the

209
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,060
commit phase has there's a unique

210
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,720
message that she at most a unique

211
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,939
message that she can possibly de commit

212
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,760
but the way we typically formalize this

213
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,040
is we say that once Alice Dee commits

214
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,540
she could not simultaneously / sorry

215
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,380
once I was commit she cannot

216
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,410
simultaneously D commit to both 0 & 1

217
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,030
classically who cares these are these

218
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,569
are equivalent definitions you can

219
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,579
basically if Alice can be commit to

220
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,550
either 0 or 1 you first D commit her to

221
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,680
0 you rewind her on and then D commit

222
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,410
her to 1 and now you have both a D

223
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,540
commitment to 0 and 1 so classically

224
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,490
these two goals were the same but

225
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,490
quantumly

226
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:34,060
maybe maybe not and here's the intuition

227
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,980
so a quantum Alice engages in the commit

228
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,530
phase and the commit the the messages

229
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,270
are still classical but you know Alice

230
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,290
is running a quantum computer on her

231
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:46,540
side maybe after the commit phase she's

232
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,630
left with some quantum state and this

233
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,260
quantum state lets her D commit to 0 or

234
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,180
it lets her D commit to 1 but she can't

235
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,819
do both and why is that

236
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:02,020
well once she D commits to 0 she needs

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,810
to produce 0 and a classical D

238
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,890
commitment which is sent to Bob right

239
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,739
remember we're insisting all the

240
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,720
communication is classical but in order

241
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,810
to do so she has to measure her quantum

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,970
state and to extract this you know

243
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,310
classical D commitment just a measure of

244
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,290
quantum state causing a collapse and now

245
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,310
when she tries to rewind and then D

246
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,380
commit to 1

247
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,030
she'll find when she rewinds her her

248
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,040
quantum state is completely messed up

249
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,160
and when she tries to D commit to one

250
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,699
she's going to get garbage so this is

251
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:38,500
this is the intuition there's a solution

252
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,850
to this given by une rue in 2016 for the

253
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,110
purpose of this talk actually it doesn't

254
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,410
really matter though so I won't spend

255
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,920
any time here so the one question that

256
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:53,560
you might ask is this really a problem

257
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,719
and it turns out maybe so here's a

258
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,359
result by in Venus and others that

259
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,670
doesn't give a concrete separation

260
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,950
between the the classical notion of

261
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,510
simultaneously D committing to 0 & 1 and

262
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,330
this better quantum notion

263
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:11,350
but they give a construction relative to

264
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,030
some Oracle but basically what they show

265
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,570
is relative to this Oracle there is a

266
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,400
scheme a classical scheme that is

267
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,750
binding in the classical sense even

268
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,790
against quantum adversaries so the

269
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,920
adversary is always quantum here but

270
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,160
we're considering this classical notion

271
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,969
of security where they D commit to 0 and

272
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,680
1 simultaneously however even though

273
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,750
it's binding in the classical sense it's

274
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,790
insecure in the quantum sense in that an

275
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,830
adversary can be commit to either 0 or 1

276
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,630
okay but at the moment you know there's

277
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:49,860
we don't know of any actual concrete

278
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:52,230
instantiations of the separation and

279
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,110
they kind of left it at that

280
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,050
so now let's segue back to our

281
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,520
discussion of no cloning and I guess the

282
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,400
question is what does all this have to

283
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,079
do with no cloning and there's this here

284
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,949
we come to the first set of results of

285
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,760
this paper

286
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,930
where we actually show that if the

287
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,439
commitment scheme and you're able to

288
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,290
certify that it's binding in the

289
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,810
classical sense but somehow security

290
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,660
breaks and you actually get this bad

291
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,280
thing in the quantum setting then

292
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,280
actually you get quantum money from this

293
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,439
and moreover if your commitment scheme

294
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,949
is not interactive you get this better

295
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,900
notion of quantum lightning and we show

296
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,050
an analogous results for signatures and

297
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,350
hash functions as well so here's the

298
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,900
intuition so suppose for the moment that

299
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,180
actually we could take the adversary

300
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,400
state after the commit phase their

301
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,609
quantum state and suppose we could clone

302
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,980
it well if we could clone it then

303
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,050
actually the two definitions of security

304
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,520
are equivalent right because then we can

305
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,020
just take the one the one state and D

306
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,540
commit use it to D commit to zero

307
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,130
potentially destroying it so you know we

308
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,900
just throw it away and then we take the

309
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,140
other state and use it to D commit to

310
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,689
one so if there was somehow a way to D

311
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,520
commit sorry to clone the adversary

312
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,589
state post commitment then we could

313
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,350
actually prove the

314
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,639
equivalence of the two definitions and

315
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,769
so what this means is that any

316
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,009
separation between the two definitions

317
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,660
inherently uses no cloning and the way

318
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,420
and so we can try to take advantage of

319
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,550
this constructively to build quantum

320
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,290
money or quantum lightning so basically

321
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,240
what we are what we'll do is we'll set

322
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,849
the bank node or bolt to be the

323
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,410
adversary state post commitment and then

324
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,809
the way you verify is you more or less

325
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:48,300
just check that the adversary is able to

326
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:52,629
break the the quantum security notion

327
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,949
all right and and that's you know that's

328
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,389
the intuition of course there's a bunch

329
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:58,149
of messy details in order to actually

330
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,410
make sure this works okay so what are

331
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:01,990
the takeaways from this well there's two

332
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,180
possible interpretations one is hey

333
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,379
these these stronger quantum notions I

334
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,149
don't need to worry about them when I'm

335
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,399
designing schemes because hey look

336
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:12,009
people have tried for a while to build

337
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,379
quantum money and lightning and it's not

338
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:18,459
done a very good job it's very hard to

339
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:20,709
build so maybe you know you could

340
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,989
conjecture that you could probably

341
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,878
reasonably conjecture that a given

342
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,139
scheme that's secure in the classical

343
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,309
sense is also secure in the quantum

344
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,579
sense because otherwise you would have

345
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:32,290
just solved this hard problem and the

346
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,599
other interpretation is maybe this is a

347
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,939
route tor provides a route towards

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,649
building quantum money or lightning

349
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,209
basically take a commitment scheme and

350
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,809
somehow try to show that it's broken in

351
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:47,559
the quantum sense right and the second

352
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:52,089
route is what we will try to do in the

353
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:53,920
latter half of the talk okay so next

354
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,100
let's turn to actually giving new

355
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,660
constructions of these objects so the

356
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,069
first construction of quantum money is

357
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,389
going to use something called program

358
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:04,240
office Kishin

359
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,819
what is this basically it just takes a

360
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,350
program scrambles it the goal is to hide

361
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:11,649
all the implementation details while

362
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,050
maintaining functionality as you all

363
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,679
probably know this has recently we've

364
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,029
been given a lot of attention and many

365
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,709
you have conjectured to be crypto

366
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,569
completes in the sense that it seems

367
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:27,369
like any task that you want to solve you

368
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:29,620
can solve using office keishon and well

369
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,480
you know so I show that this actually

370
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,149
does hold true at least for quantum

371
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,160
so if you have indistinguishability

372
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,070
obfuscation is a usual way we formalize

373
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,910
things then you can actually get public

374
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,680
key quantum money and this this lemma or

375
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,250
this theorem is composed of two lemmas

376
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,319
one says that this other notion of

377
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,880
office occasionally hiding off the

378
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,519
station implies quantum money and then

379
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,660
shows that then the second lemma is

380
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,389
indistinguishable the obfuscation

381
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,699
implies this other notion of obfuscation

382
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,560
and this second lemma here is rather

383
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:06,130
easy from non techniques the more

384
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,329
interesting one is the first one I'm not

385
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,470
going to go into the proof of either of

386
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:13,449
these but I do just want to explain what

387
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,449
the security notion is so that you can

388
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,069
try to come up with other constructions

389
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:20,920
of subspace hiding office caters to

390
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,510
build quantum money so here's here's

391
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,689
what sub-sites hiding office Kishin is

392
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,399
so basically the office cater the the

393
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,790
input programs are just going to be

394
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,899
identified I'm going to be the functions

395
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,000
that I'll put one on a particular

396
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,449
subspace and I'll put zero everywhere

397
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,100
else and so what we're going for the

398
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,800
security property we need is we're going

399
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,290
to imagine two spaces being chosen at

400
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,329
random as larger subspace T and a

401
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,870
smaller subspace s that's contained in T

402
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:52,089
and what the adversary sees is they're

403
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,139
going to see s the smaller subspace and

404
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:55,899
they're either going to see an

405
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,130
occupation the program that computes s

406
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,190
or they're going to see an obfuscation

407
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,660
in the program that computes T and the

408
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,920
security requirement that we need is

409
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,920
that these two are indistinguishable

410
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,400
right so if you can if you can build a

411
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,589
subspace hiding off you skater with you

412
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,209
know the right parameters then you would

413
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,458
immediately good public key quantum

414
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:20,140
money and solve this apparently

415
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:23,650
difficult problem okay so for the other

416
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,640
set of the other result is for

417
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,809
constructing quantum lining

418
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,819
unfortunately I don't know how to

419
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,860
construct this from subspace hiding off

420
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,330
East occation or even the you know the

421
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,240
stronger notion of indistinguishability

422
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,120
off you station here's all what I'm

423
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,840
going to try to do is construct quantum

424
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,939
lining from learning with errors I don't

425
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,029
know how to do this what I what you

426
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,649
and show is that this this is not

427
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:51,379
something that I formally define in the

428
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:55,008
paper but you can show something that

429
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:56,769
I'll call for this talk at Gap lwe is

430
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:00,740
good enough to build quantum lightning

431
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:03,379
so what is what does gap lwe firstly the

432
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,269
graphics got messed up here but what

433
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:07,879
we're going to imagine is that we have

434
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,860
some distribution on and what this

435
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:12,949
distribution is going to output is a

436
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,219
tall matrix a and some auxilary

437
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,809
information now the auxiliary and all a

438
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,509
and the auxiliary information are going

439
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:23,690
to be given to the adversary and now

440
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:25,940
what we want is three things so the

441
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,429
first thing is we want that cyst or the

442
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,809
short integer solution is hard relative

443
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,669
to this matrix a with the auxiliary

444
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,080
information so if the adversary is given

445
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,929
a they're given the exhibitor

446
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,678
information that they can't find a short

447
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:45,200
vector X in the left kernel of a this is

448
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:47,990
the this problem it turns out that

449
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,779
there's a quantum reduction more or less

450
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,169
due to rev that shows that if this is

451
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,419
hard

452
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:56,090
another problem is hard which is called

453
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,789
the search lwe problem and here what

454
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:04,070
you're given is you're you're given a

455
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:05,809
dot s for a random random vector s so

456
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,658
this is basically a random element in

457
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,879
the column span of a now of course if I

458
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,549
gave you that you could easily recover s

459
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:16,158
using linear algebra but you know you

460
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:19,820
add noise and then this presumably

461
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:23,360
becomes hard but the the goal so what is

462
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,840
hard is taking a sample of a des plus E

463
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,678
and recovering s so we need both of

464
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,590
these problems to be hard you know so

465
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:38,179
far this is this is this is normal you

466
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:40,070
can use if a is just a random matrix

467
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,370
this corresponds to the usual assists

468
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,570
and search lwe assumption which are

469
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,449
known to be hard based on worst case

470
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,149
lattice problems the the wrinkle here is

471
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,879
that we want decisional lwe problem to

472
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:55,758
be easy so what is decisional lwe it

473
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:57,560
just says that given one of these LWT

474
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,380
samples you can't tell whether was an LW

475
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,929
simple or a uniform random vector and

476
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,090
here we actually want we want this to be

477
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,850
easy now normally if you just if your

478
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,929
matrix is just uniformly random the same

479
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,699
reductions that work force a search lwe

480
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:17,240
also can be used to show that decision

481
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,610
llw is hard so we want to wait basically

482
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,070
to preserve the hardness we want to you

483
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,139
know break the matrix a in a way that

484
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,179
preserves the search lwe hardness and

485
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,040
preserves assist hardness but somehow

486
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,070
allows the decisional problem to be easy

487
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,990
and and i call this a gap lwe because

488
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,639
there's sort of an analogy here to gap

489
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,210
diffie-hellman where you can think of

490
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,100
maybe sis is the analog of discrete log

491
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,840
search LW is the analog of CDH and

492
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,830
decisional other beauties the analog OD

493
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,540
d h and a gap tiffy Hellman group you

494
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,290
know has has two of those being hard and

495
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:54,530
the other one being easy right so in any

496
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:56,629
case if you can find such a matrix with

497
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,670
like Ziller information such that the

498
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,180
three of these are true then you

499
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,440
immediately get quantum lightning now

500
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,950
unfortunately I don't know how to

501
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,020
instantiate this what I do in the paper

502
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,280
is I give a candidate modification where

503
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,440
we basically change the notion of

504
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,260
shortness to news it normally shortness

505
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,540
is l 2-norm I'm gonna change the notion

506
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,370
to rank norm basically what happens is

507
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:23,360
you interpret the vector as a matrix and

508
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,300
insist that it's rank is small this

509
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,520
actually doesn't really work because

510
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:33,560
rank nor the Syst version and for rank

511
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:36,050
norm is actually easy but you can kind

512
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:42,379
of massage things to get something that

513
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:44,139
looks that looks reasonable yeah

514
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,150
unfortunately it has been broken in some

515
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,660
settings but I don't know maybe there's

516
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,520
some some hardness here that can be

517
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,850
verified but clearly much more work

518
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,830
needs to be done

519
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,830
yeah and that that basically concludes

520
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,659
my talk so you know please work on these

521
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,240
problems I think they're very

522
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,280
interesting and and hopefully I've made

523
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,540
it clear like some some things you can

524
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,330
think about without no having to know

525
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,129
anything about quantum

526
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,839
to make progress on building quantum

527
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:15,209
money and lightning so with that I'll

528
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:25,530
end thank you

529
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:28,980
[Applause]

530
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,980
great questions

531
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,730
that's one going

532
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,279
we know that the naive version of

533
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,289
quantum becoming man doesn't work

534
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,470
because you can do a gentle measurement

535
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:58,049
to get back last day so can you go on

536
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,570
little detail about what's your

537
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,929
definition of the become meme and to

538
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,520
make it possible

539
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:09,900
what's used to make it possible to do

540
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,658
what exactly what again so to make it

541
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,820
actually binding because if the binding

542
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,289
has a high probability of a success

543
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:21,178
there but it's got higher incidence

544
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:24,408
gentlemen German lemma you can get

545
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,409
bigger the contest day Oh

546
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,899
[Music]

547
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:34,950
what why can't you just always rewind

548
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:38,370
Yeah right the problem is that this when

549
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:40,770
you act well when you dekum it you're

550
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,110
not just sending you're not just sending

551
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:47,549
the bit 0 or 1 but you're sending the

552
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:50,459
proof right in this okay so the

553
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:52,620
intuition is basically what you might

554
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,049
hope to have is that the proof is

555
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,870
actually a superposition of proofs but

556
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:59,580
once you classical eyes it by measuring

557
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,260
so that you're actually sending what's

558
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,360
the right slide to show once you're

559
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,299
actually sending a classical D

560
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,219
commitment to Bob so you have to you

561
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:11,220
have to take the superposition over

562
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,710
proofs measure it and that's going to

563
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,080
force a collapse on that you can't then

564
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,649
undo okay

565
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,649
does that make sense

566
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:33,850
so I I have a question about this sub

567
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,129
subspace of whose Cashen problem so is

568
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,020
is that like a related notion of like

569
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,370
what should be publicly viewable from

570
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,809
like for I don't know for program

571
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,510
obfuscation we have a notion of

572
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,970
computation of input and output and for

573
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,010
the subspace of obfuscation what's that

574
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,520
is that is there something publicly

575
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,920
publicly no so the only thing that's

576
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,290
probably so the I mean the algorithm

577
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,000
froggy skating is is of course public

578
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,450
but the only other thing that's made

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,160
public is the subspace s so just s you

580
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,540
know you wrote you know and all the

581
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,280
obfuscation literature you always assume

582
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:10,450
that the obfuscation algorithm is public

583
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,530
but nothing nothing else is public that

584
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,530
answer your question

585
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,940
okay so there's just subspaces random

586
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,309
with no like is there a notion of size

587
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,950
or of structure of those subspaces or

588
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:28,720
does no I mean I I've gloss over some

589
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,510
details but yeah the you know basically

590
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,919
the S will be of a given dimension T

591
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:37,299
will be of a given dimension but

592
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,860
otherwise are uniformly random and you

593
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:40,809
have a fairly maybe fairly basic

594
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,510
question regarding the the quantum money

595
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:47,080
application so if I verify the proof

596
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,330
this does not collapse the state or like

597
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,799
so if I like verify the proof is the

598
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,610
money then destroyed or how does this

599
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,280
sort of work conceptually so yeah a you

600
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:00,120
know you usually you would insist that

601
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,000
verification does not destroy the state

602
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,469
but there's there's actually generically

603
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,419
you can take any verification algorithm

604
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,070
even one that does destroy the state as

605
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:12,780
long as it succeeds with overwhelming

606
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:16,360
probability on honest banknotes you can

607
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:24,820
modify it so that it will also actually

608
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:28,449
preserve the original state Thanks hi so

609
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,840
when you when you look at quantum money

610
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,850
so I understand correctly that if you do

611
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,668
the verification interactively with the

612
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,559
with the mint basically what the mean

613
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:40,899
would do would the

614
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,399
stroy the quantum token verified that

615
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:47,799
it's actually correct regenerate another

616
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,840
one and send it back with a certificate

617
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,879
of authenticity this is more or less

618
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,580
what happens correctly sure I guess I

619
00:26:54,879 --> 00:27:00,370
mean I mean you can you can interpret

620
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,320
what the mint does differently but more

621
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,908
more or less that's right okay

622
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,059
and now the goal would be to do it

623
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:10,320
actually public key verification right

624
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:13,690
exactly this sounds a little bit like

625
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,820
verifying the digital signature or on a

626
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,980
quantum state correct verifying a what

627
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,059
protocol a digital signature on a

628
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:25,629
quantum state it's it's related except

629
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:29,950
so the the the thing is if you could

630
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:31,480
imagine like a I mean the problem with

631
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,119
signatures is that depending on how you

632
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,299
actually define things signing a quantum

633
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,509
state is actually impossible yeah but

634
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:42,158
yeah it is related okay so that exactly

635
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:44,919
so I was wondering what was the

636
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,340
intuition that allows to circumvent this

637
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,080
impossibility result let's say I mean I

638
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,470
guess I guess the intuition is is we're

639
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,119
not quantum money is more is a more

640
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,669
general that's more general the right

641
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,139
word no it's it's more restrictive of a

642
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,879
concept than signing a quantum state and

643
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:06,389
intuitively the the impossibility for

644
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:09,399
signing a quantum state is just that

645
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:12,879
authentication of quantum states implies

646
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:15,279
encryption and you know normally the way

647
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:16,918
you would formalize signatures is it

648
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,299
always leaves the message in the clear

649
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,509
here there's there's sort of no message

650
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:25,200
that needs to be in the clear so you

651
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:31,149
know we don't care if things are secret

652
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,180
okay I see thank you okay we'll end the

653
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:40,579
session here thank Mike again

654
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:40,579
