1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
our new work on new verify new schemes

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,710
were verified allegation of quad

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,389
computation so let me just start by

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,240
introducing why do we need this problem

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,669
so first let's assume that you live in a

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,830
word that quantum computers can be

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,770
implemented in practice and that they

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,720
they do have more power computational

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,359
power than classical computers so that's

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,740
what Boz Barak coin is the superior

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,210
world so that's awesome we can solve

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,759
problems that you could not do without

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,450
quantum computers but this computers are

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,579
super expensive and not every University

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,989
or now every Research Institute would be

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,219
able to to buy them so this quantum this

17
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,550
this compression of power would be

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,899
limited to very power like which

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:54,828
instance but not everyone could could

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:58,829
afford it but as IBM does today we could

21
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:01,020
outsource our quantum computation to to

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,850
take to the cloud so we couldn't send

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,979
our quantum circuit it would be run in

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,439
this quantum server and we would have

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,630
our answer back but the question is how

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,289
can you guarantee that this server is

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,060
running a quantum computation so for

28
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,009
some problems that are in NP then it

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,140
could be easy you just verify the

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,759
solution but first as if you were doing

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,860
sampling how can you guarantee the

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:28,320
sampling is being done from the right

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,000
distribution so ideally what you would

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,779
like to do is have an interactive proof

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,860
system for let's say for BTOP the class

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,780
of polynomial times one computation

37
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,159
where the verifier in this in this

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,820
interactive system is completely

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,549
classical and she delegates quantum

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,648
computation to a quantum server that in

41
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,930
the honest case would really only need

42
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:57,420
polynomial time counter computation and

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,729
we'd like this protocol to be sound

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,439
against any type in any malicious prover

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:07,170
so we'd like statistical soundness and

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,598
ideally the the verifier should not have

47
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,580
to release like to tell the prover what

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,980
her secret is so she wanted to do it in

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,450
a blind way

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,369
so this date your word we really don't

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,850
know how to do it now but we can relax

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,770
the model so one thing that we know

53
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,280
versus from classical phone box the

54
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,320
theory is that the QP is in space so you

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,370
have an interactive proof system where

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,320
the prover is classical but exponential

57
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,450
or for instance we could give some

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,200
limited quantum power to the verifier

59
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,739
and we have very efficient protocols in

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,880
the setting a third model would be okay

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,320
we don't maybe don't need sati scoffs

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,970
honest we could have computational

63
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,579
sounds and that's fine for us

64
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,030
so in this recent Wars by Mahadeva she

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,500
showed the first protocol in the setting

66
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:03,750
but in this talk I'll consider another

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,030
model where you have the very fire

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,070
that's classical and it's very far

69
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,280
delegating quantum invitation not to one

70
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,859
but to two servers and the servers they

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
share some quantum correlation but then

72
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,570
they're not allowed to communicate

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,600
anymore so they are separated and

74
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,799
they're all communications is cut

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,790
between them and the good thing about

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,730
this model is that we do achieve

77
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,630
statistical soundness so the in the in

78
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,840
the no case

79
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,920
no kind of provers no no strategy of the

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,160
approvers would make the very fair

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,619
except with high probability the

82
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,810
downside of this of this model like

83
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,940
technology technologically is that

84
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,390
keeping entanglement is so keeping this

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,490
contra correlation is somewhat

86
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,220
challenging but on the good side all

87
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,540
this all of this challenge is kept to

88
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,940
the servers so the verifier is

89
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,500
completely classical whenever she wants

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,329
to delegate she can join the game

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:10,350
because she just have a plan a classical

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:12,120
computer so in 2002 record emiram was

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,090
irani they solve this problem by

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,798
proposing a protocol to prove earth

95
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,040
where they only need a polynomial

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,340
resource to solve this question so we

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,200
think ok now we're done but not if you

98
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,479
see like what's the polynomial so if you

99
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,380
want to delegate

100
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,390
a quantum computation temptation decades

101
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:37,159
the complexity of the of the server's is

102
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:39,530
G to the 8,000 so there has been a lot

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,110
of work trying to improve this but up to

104
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,179
our work the like if you have only to

105
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:50,290
prove errs the best you could do is G to

106
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:54,320
2000 and in our work

107
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:57,050
okay we're dealing with delegation of

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,890
quantum computation on n qubits G gates

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:05,600
and the these gates are on a circuit

110
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:09,890
with that D and we we were able to

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,750
devise two protocols in the first one in

112
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,400
both of them the complex is G log G so

113
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,780
it's almost optimal so we cannot hope

114
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,520
best an order of G and in the first of

115
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,739
in the first protocol the number of

116
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,789
rounds is linear on the depth of the

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,250
circuit but it's blind and then we can

118
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,140
reduce the number that the the rounds of

119
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,840
communication in the protocol to

120
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:39,289
constant but - but at the cost of losing

121
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:41,929
- so comparing to the previous results

122
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:46,640
we have very good improvement from from

123
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,860
the from them and from the rest of this

124
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,590
talk ok we'll review some basic notions

125
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,540
and quantum levitation and then I will

126
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:00,500
try to explain how do we achieve such

127
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:02,420
delegation protocols so first concept in

128
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,360
quantum information what's the qubit and

129
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:10,790
a qubit is the finest a unit vector in C

130
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,280
- ok so if you consider some a basis 0

131
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,860
and N 1 so the vector is like V but

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,690
quantum formation we hear it the

133
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,450
notation from physics so instead of

134
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,219
having these as vectors we call this cat

135
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,039
zero and cat 1 as a base state and

136
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:30,100
usually cat's eye or cat 5 will be our

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,100
our qubits or quantum states in general

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,429
and again this is notation so dead so

139
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:39,810
the size be like like cat's-eye it would

140
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,139
be a column vector so the

141
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,630
the transpose would be a cat like the

142
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:50,910
other around to be a bra and then inner

143
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:52,350
product is a bracket we have a qubit and

144
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,260
then how do we do computation it we

145
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,060
apply unitary operations on it so this

146
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,980
doesn't have a lot of impact in our

147
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,200
unlike in our result so it's just that

148
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,720
there is a way of doing computation rate

149
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,190
but what's very relevant is how do we do

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,430
measurements so how do you have the

151
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,810
output of your of your computation and

152
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,030
for instance let's say assume that have

153
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,479
a qubits I and then you can choose a

154
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:19,200
basis on on on c2 in order to measure

155
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,750
your output and then your outcome will

156
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,400
be B which probability Phi B sigh like

157
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,150
the node a in your Prada between Phi B

158
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,460
upside and most important are also very

159
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,039
important after you measure and you have

160
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,440
this output B your state that of sigh it

161
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,639
collapses to Phi B so if you continue

162
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,950
measuring you always have Phi B so just

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,870
an example for those who have never seen

164
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,729
it so for instance we have the plus

165
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,400
state is the half like super position

166
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:49,770
between 0 and 1 and if you measuring the

167
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,229
compassion of a Z so in the canonical

168
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,950
basis you have each outcome as verbs we

169
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:58,800
have and after that you have you have

170
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,800
you continue like your state collapses

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,970
to the to our management but you could

172
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,490
choose to measure it in the plus/minus

173
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,090
basis and in this case you always so if

174
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,950
you start with the state plus you always

175
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:16,349
have plus with product 1 as an outcome

176
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:19,650
and your se doesn't change so another

177
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:23,070
important important concept in this talk

178
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:27,770
of entanglement so an EPR pair is called

179
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:30,630
this two qubit state 0 0 plus 1 1 and

180
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,370
the important about this is that about

181
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,950
the state it cannot be written as a

182
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,310
product of two states so somehow this

183
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,820
state can only be seen as a whole as a

184
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:44,849
whole state and not as two parts in

185
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,940
particular for every one could be states

186
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,770
I the CPR pair can be written as side

187
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,070
side plus side perpendicular seven

188
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,790
particular and in particular if you

189
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,270
measure the first qubit on any basis

190
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,949
then then you know like then you know

191
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,449
what's the measured state like what's

192
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,730
the post measure to state all on the

193
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,650
second on the second part as well so

194
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,320
this allows like in this two prover

195
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,890
setting to somehow steer what's what's

196
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:20,370
the state on on on the other approval

197
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:25,260
for any basis and this is one of the

198
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:27,710
main sources of conto correlations so

199
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,380
let's see a bit more okay sure

200
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,410
so how our protocol works so we're based

201
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:38,900
on a protocol that's proposed by

202
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,829
broadband where we have a semi-classical

203
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,260
verifier so the verifier is a bit

204
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,480
quantum because the verifier and

205
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,660
approver they share a bunch of disappear

206
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,040
pairs and then bradman proposed this

207
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,219
protocol where the verifier just send

208
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,230
random coins to the proverb the prover

209
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,510
answers like the products his magic

210
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,510
answers to some value C and then the

211
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,300
verifier just chooses some some basis

212
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:09,150
some some some some some basis to

213
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,709
measure her shares of PR pairs and okay

214
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,870
what we import and technically to his

215
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,260
sock is that all these measurements are

216
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,570
one qubit clifford observables so it's

217
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,160
very technical but that was the hard

218
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,390
technical pilot who had to prove in our

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,760
in our result and then that is that the

220
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,520
verifier chooses these measurements that

221
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,400
she does in a way that either should be

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:38,370
testing the prover or she's helping the

223
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:41,069
prover to do the computation and that is

224
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,690
if if the prover passes the test then he

225
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,550
was not cheating so she can she can

226
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,600
detect that the previous of malicious

227
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,160
and in this case oh yeah and then then

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,280
in this case when when she decided to do

229
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:59,209
the computation she has the right output

230
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,800
and in our result what you do okay we

231
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,290
start from this protocol where you have

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,740
this quantum verifier and we want to

233
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,599
make our verifier classical by

234
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,820
getting the verifier of the first

235
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,399
protocol to a second prover so now we

236
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,440
have to prove his point B and the

237
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,089
verifier will help them run the original

238
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:26,630
protocol where the verifier was also

239
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:29,000
quantum and suppose for a moment that TV

240
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,550
is on it's in this second protocol then

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,170
we couldn't merge V and P V V prime MPV

242
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,500
and then we're back to the first

243
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,689
protocol then our per code B sound the

244
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,110
problem is how can you test BV so how

245
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,899
can you assume how can you enforce pv to

246
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:49,149
do the honest part to the own strategy

247
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:52,310
and then we go to non-local games so

248
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:55,370
another to prevaricate a non-local game

249
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,729
is a game where you have a verifier that

250
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,290
ask questions to the provers who cannot

251
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,050
communicate and then it's perverse

252
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,719
answer back with some some answers and

253
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,699
they verifier proceed some check for

254
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,279
instance the famous game is the CH sh

255
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,620
game where the verifier just send random

256
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,470
bits to the provers the provers answer

257
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,050
answer some values a and B and the

258
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,029
primers pass the test if and only if the

259
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,370
multiplication of the day of the

260
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:25,760
questions is equal to the sum of the

261
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,089
answers or in other words they pass the

262
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,130
test if the parity of the answers is 1

263
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:36,800
if and only if both questions are 1 and

264
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,390
if you think a little bit you see that

265
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,359
classic if they only show a classic

266
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,490
around honest the approvers can not pass

267
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,660
this test with loyalty more than a more

268
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,610
than 3/4 however it was shown that with

269
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,829
if they disprove is that there is a

270
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,480
control strategy for such provers that

271
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,420
they pass it with parity X tricked ly

272
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,290
bigger than 3/4 so quantum communication

273
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:04,069
will add them to solve this problem with

274
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,130
higher probability so this is a strategy

275
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,020
it's not very important why what is

276
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,370
specifically teased but what is

277
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,949
important is that what has been shown

278
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,120
for this for this for this type of game

279
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,550
is that if you have to prove us that

280
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,630
pass this test was very very close to

281
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,089
the optimal one

282
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,580
then the strategy that they're doing is

283
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,180
exactly this no not exactly it's close

284
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,860
to this but they cannot they could not

285
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,689
be doing something else and I achieve

286
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,520
such probability except this probability

287
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,350
so these allow us to somehow from this

288
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,910
test we can characterize exactly what

289
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,550
their preferred what the professor's are

290
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:49,750
doing so technically what what we need

291
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,000
to do then is to have a non-local game

292
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:55,160
that allows us to do this the same type

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,390
of arguments for one qubit clifford's

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,760
remember these are the the observables

295
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,650
that the quantum verifier adequate the

296
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,560
quantum verifier was doing in broadband

297
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:12,020
protocol so such a game would help us

298
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:14,930
test pv in our new protocol and in this

299
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:19,100
non-local game the the approvers should

300
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:23,329
share mep repairs and and just perform

301
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:26,300
the correct measurement on them then

302
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,890
we're able to show that okay this design

303
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,130
strategy passed early exponentially

304
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,319
closed one and most important we have

305
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,420
the rigidity theorem that shows that any

306
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,460
strategy that pass with relative 1 minus

307
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,380
epsilon is squirt of epsilon close to

308
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,380
the optimal one to the honest one

309
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,329
then what our Perko is with some

310
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,689
probability the verifier makes the two

311
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:53,840
prefers played this our ANOVA game this

312
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,140
noon a local game and whispered to one

313
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:02,090
minus P the verifier makes the prover

314
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:07,939
simulate broadband protocol and that is

315
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:10,070
that for from the perspective PV he

316
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,850
cannot distinguish which of these two

317
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:16,070
tests are being done in this case when

318
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,070
you're doing the normal call game we can

319
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,470
somehow bootstrap the like the strategy

320
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,980
and say that the prover the PV is being

321
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,710
honest

322
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,890
and once that we know that PV is honest

323
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,260
then you can test PP and then a and if

324
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:33,260
PP is also honest by the second test

325
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,460
then we know that they are performing

326
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,560
the correct competent

327
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:41,810
when we prime decides to do it so here's

328
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,349
another way of seeing it so we have this

329
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:50,300
Vegeta Clifford test that the self tests

330
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:53,420
PV npp when you when they pass this test

331
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,939
with high probability and then on the

332
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,949
from VV perspective

333
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,110
he'll be honest in all of the honor of

334
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,170
the realms and then from Pisa can we can

335
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,610
prove that if they pass the other test

336
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,140
with high probability then they are

337
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:13,940
doing the correct computation at the end

338
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:17,689
of the day so in this protocol we need

339
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,770
order of the communicate runs of

340
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,390
communication in order to achieve

341
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,819
soundness and then in the in the dog dog

342
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:29,750
walk protocol we actually what to do we

343
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:33,080
tell PV what the circuit is and we'll

344
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,750
ask PV to be exactly the onus Provera

345
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,950
fire in Broadband's protocol so he has

346
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,500
much more power and but more power Mars

347
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:47,450
responsibility so we also have to test

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,940
if knowing Q wouldn't allow PV to to to

349
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,120
cheat more so we couldn't have some

350
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,900
strategy that will fool the verifier so

351
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,210
we have much more complicated set of

352
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,930
leashes here so that's why we call it a

353
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,880
dog walker protocol and for this we need

354
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,980
to somehow strengthen our rigidity

355
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,980
theorem for adding some tomography there

356
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,010
some of them problems ought to leave is

357
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:19,160
that ok can you have run round schemes

358
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,790
that use almost linear resources so this

359
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,290
is still open

360
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,349
also can you have blind protocols that

361
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:32,060
they have constant around cosine round

362
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:34,610
complexity and finally towards our ideal

363
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,649
world can you have protocols where ok

364
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,689
the verifier delegates her point on

365
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,060
competition to to prove errs but now the

366
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,440
provers their quantum computers but they

367
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,360
are not in the indian instructions

368
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,070
they're not entangled somehow you should

369
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,990
be able you could be able I don't know

370
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,149
to use one plover to test the second one

371
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:56,150
or something like this but that I think

372
00:17:50,150 --> 00:18:01,150
that will be a very step towards the

373
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,150
ideal world and thanks for our attention

374
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,410
any questions

375
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:19,029
so in this test that you have as the

376
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,159
basic construct so when you when you

377
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,089
send X&Y and then you receive a and B

378
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,539
uh-huh

379
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:28,269
so I mean are they I'm I'm wondering if

380
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,559
they're somehow related to the actual

381
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,839
computation that you want a computer

382
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,489
they are not they're just random tests

383
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,299
so they're not related to the circuit

384
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:39,729
that you want to compute some related is

385
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:42,519
just to test if the some house just to

386
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:43,599
test the strategy because then the

387
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:52,899
optimal strategy

388
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:54,729
so what's related is that yeah it's not

389
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:57,728
related like to the computation but some

390
00:18:54,729 --> 00:19:00,909
you see this dishonest strategy we are

391
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:05,259
interested in this X and Zed so this is

392
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:07,389
okay in a obfuscated way is what is the

393
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:11,049
basis of the measurement that the

394
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:13,089
prefers are doing so somehow we can if

395
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:16,509
they pass this game that's independent

396
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:17,950
of the of the computation somehow we

397
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:22,029
have some guarantees on the measurements

398
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:24,099
that they're doing I don't see how to

399
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:27,459
prove so the troop the to prove or stay

400
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:29,499
don't so they cannot show you there is

401
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:31,509
some trust there then I don't know to

402
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:33,609
communicate yeah but how do you trust

403
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:38,820
that they execute the right computation

404
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:41,739
I don't get that oh that comes from

405
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,889
actually I didn't say much about this

406
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:47,079
this comes from Rodman's protocol but

407
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,519
they might not execute abroad so you

408
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,320
have to actually check that they are

409
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,049
executing that protocol for the right

410
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,939
computation so this comes from

411
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:58,149
Broadband's protocol so in her protocol

412
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,950
she somehow the verifier tests if the

413
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:04,299
right computation has been done so in

414
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,219
the second part so in this the

415
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:10,269
computation the second part is a crude

416
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:11,679
original protocol these the verifier is

417
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:13,509
exactly checking if they are doing the

418
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,999
right computation one of the steps so

419
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,679
the int and the entanglement pairs and

420
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,089
everything so their pairs just because

421
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,679
there are two proverbs but if you'd have

422
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:24,819
three provers you need like a bigger

423
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,280
entangled state or two so yeah yes but

424
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:29,560
then it's trickier because

425
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,510
as we cover saying about manam again

426
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,530
monogamy of entanglement you could not

427
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:38,790
have three part I'd EPR pair so then it

428
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,790
becomes a bit more tricky okay

429
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:48,510
well let's thank the speaker again

430
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,510
[Applause]
