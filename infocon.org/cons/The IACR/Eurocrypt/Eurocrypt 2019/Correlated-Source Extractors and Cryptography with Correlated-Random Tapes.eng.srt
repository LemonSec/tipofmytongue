00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:06,690
hello everyone my name is Ethan song

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,510
today I'm honored to introduce our

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,000
recent work choristers instructors and

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,519
the cryptography is called his random

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,519
tips course always professor we pocoyo

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,698
randomness is crucial for cryptography

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,910
based on several previous results

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,279
without randomness several basic tasks

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,329
are impossible to realize for example

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,430
the knowledge encryption and so on so in

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,370
this work we would like to get a better

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:44,370
understanding on the extent to which

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:46,910
randomness is necessary to be more clear

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,550
we consider the following question

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,429
suppose that a party uses correlated

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,760
tapes in multiple executions of a

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,090
cryptographic algorithm can the security

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,550
still be preserved this question can be

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,640
motivated by for example a defective

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,500
random number generator which outputs

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,990
correlated tapes under multiple

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:16,020
occasions so we will non line of

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,509
research of reset for security where a

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,970
party uses the same random tape across

25
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,270
multiple executions can be seen as a

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,210
special case of our general problem for

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,320
example reset both your knowledge reset

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,630
the security mutation and so on in this

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,408
work we need to initiate a systematic

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,929
study of the above question as an

31
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,210
example let us first have a close look

32
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,460
at correlated tapes to knowledge we

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,548
model correlations among the random

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,589
tapes by considering anniversary which

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,860
may have limited control over the random

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,530
tapes of the analyst party to be more

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,590
clear a malicious very fair is allowed

38
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,600
to specify T tampering functions a 1 to

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,090
a T then the random number generator in

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,329
the first execution is replaced by a 1

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,480
and in the second execution by 2 and so

42
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,480
on

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,959
after that a string exodus sampled a

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,660
uniformly this axe can be seen as the

45
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,880
original random random tape which is

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,049
unknown to either the prover or the

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,750
verifier in the first execution the

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,810
prover uses a 1 X as this random tape

49
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,950
and a 2 ax in the second execution and

50
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,510
so on the prover is stateless well the

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,459
very very state flow across all

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:51,149
executions we point out that using a 1 X

53
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:58,470
280 X is a very natural way to model

54
00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:01,110
Tico his strings one can see that if the

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,690
very fair truth is altering functions to

56
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,370
be the identity function then this

57
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,370
becomes reset does your knowledge

58
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,170
however correlated tapes your knowledge

59
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,810
is impossible to realize even if T is 1

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,630
and a 1 actually is guaranteed to have

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,220
enough me entropy this is based on the

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,170
work of toadies and his closers

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,480
therefore we consider to use a small

64
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,208
random seed in the shared random stream

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,608
model which is a weaker model than the

66
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:42,090
Sierras model in our work we further

67
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,850
show that if the timing functions can

68
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,209
depend on the seriouser as a seed so it

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,880
is still impossible therefore we require

70
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:58,140
that the terminal functions should be

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:00,000
independent of the seed other notions

72
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,768
like correlatives multi-party

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,109
computation as are correlated tape

74
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,540
multiple accommodation curried tapes

75
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:09,359
secure encryption can be defined in an

76
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,940
analogous way the central object in our

77
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,910
work is a new notion of randomness

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:22,048
detractors which we call : source

79
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:24,510
instructors very informally a seeded

80
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,179
correlative random choristers destructor

81
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:31,669
an input a seed s

82
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,919
and a source X produces a uniform output

83
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:38,758
which is independent of the temporal

84
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:42,900
results generated by the same seed s but

85
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:46,710
the temperature source is ax we require

86
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,020
that for every tempering function a I

87
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:53,070
should not alter the same string as his

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:59,729
input when we think that it is the to

89
00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:02,639
notion of nom instructors as phenomena

90
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,330
instructors there is only one source but

91
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,900
multiple tamper disease nominal

92
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,448
structures were introduced in 2009 by

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,250
the design which they have played an

94
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,190
important role in cryptography and the

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,590
complexity for example in prep the

96
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:27,570
amplification designing mm structures

97
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:30,060
and designing nominal codes in our work

98
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,030
we define the corythosaurus attractors

99
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,840
and another notion we call his those

100
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:39,869
instructors the me entropy requirements

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,960
of both notions is the point Nami ok

102
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,650
which takes the number of the executions

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,120
T the length of the output M and the

104
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,340
seedlings D as input the error rates is

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,300
the malarial function of the security

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,638
parameter Kappa the difference between

107
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,750
these two notions is the requirements of

108
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,630
the sibilants Icefall choristers

109
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,599
instructors the students only depends on

110
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,810
the security parameter which means the

111
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:17,580
number of ask executions is independent

112
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,830
of the seedlings for Vic course

113
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,810
instructors the seedlings can't growth

114
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:27,900
control with the number of the

115
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,669
executions so we would like to point out

116
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,090
the connection between Whitaker is

117
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:36,029
correlated source attractors and 2001

118
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,810
structures where the latter notion was

119
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,950
introduced in 2014 by Kiev tree and the

120
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,740
cross for me and

121
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:50,340
most constructive was first constructed

122
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:53,850
in 2016 by telepathy I go Yan Li so it

123
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,690
is actually a stronger notion because

124
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:02,730
the better the rosary is allowed to

125
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:04,620
temper posters is separately 2000

126
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,010
illegal structures implies the existence

127
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,230
of weak choristers instructors by

128
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,409
considering the second source why has

129
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:18,390
the seed and there's no term rings on

130
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,370
the second source however the second is

131
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,890
the length of the second source grows

132
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,080
with the number of the executions which

133
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:32,880
means little note implies the existence

134
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:35,280
of corythosaurus instructors our result

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,440
gives an explicit construction of a

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,320
chorus of instructor with the volume

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,120
parameter so we simply set the secure

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,349
perimeter sorry we simply set the

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,130
seedlings as the security parameter

140
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:52,590
recall that K is the entropy requirement

141
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,020
epsilon is the error rate T is the

142
00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:02,039
number of executions and M is the length

143
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:05,549
of the output we also give existential

144
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,920
results of corridors instructors we note

145
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,340
that the me entropy requirement is

146
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,680
almost a necessary condition

147
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,460
imagine that all tamron functions are

148
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,220
chosen as different permutations so in

149
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:24,900
this case I Riyadh put should be uniform

150
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:27,480
and independent with others so it

151
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,789
requires that the original source to

152
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,790
have at least three times M me entropy

153
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,659
now let us first see how this new notion

154
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:43,709
could help us construct kora T tapes

155
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,329
your knowledge we first require that for

156
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:50,240
every temple function AI

157
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:53,880
area I should have enough me entropy now

158
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,720
under the constraint set for every two

159
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,079
tampering funk

160
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:03,839
AI and AJ civil not all to the same

161
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:07,620
string and Irene puts in the prover can

162
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,459
simply apply a coroner's instructor on

163
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,620
the random tape and the seed then use

164
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,518
the result as a new random tape in this

165
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:20,850
execution the property of course

166
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,430
instructors guarantee stats the prover

167
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,800
will use independent and run independent

168
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,599
random tapes in different executions and

169
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,089
therefore the security is preserved to

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,009
relax the second constraint will rely on

171
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:39,899
the technique from reset was your

172
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:42,300
knowledge in general reset with your

173
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,839
knowledge allows us to handle the case

174
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,949
where the prover uses the same random

175
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,720
tape across multiple executions

176
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:54,000
correlated source instructors allow us

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,410
to handle the case where each random

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,730
tape differs from every other one

179
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,219
therefore we can combine these two

180
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:06,540
notions to handle all possible tampering

181
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:09,540
functions however there's the subtle

182
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,810
leakage issue with this approach imagine

183
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,240
that some tampering function AI just

184
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:19,199
outputs the same as a 1 with probability

185
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,329
1/2 then learning whether these two

186
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:24,269
executions use the same random tape

187
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,719
leaked further information about X to

188
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,720
the adversary

189
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:35,009
fortunately this amount of leakage can

190
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:37,610
be upper bounded to show security

191
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,649
we simply leak this information about

192
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,639
which to thermal functions will be off

193
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:47,220
of the same string to the other was Ray

194
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:50,730
we differ a pattern of X to be a vector

195
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:55,290
as 1/2 as T where each element is an

196
00:10:50,730 --> 00:11:00,689
integer between 1 to T so it satisfies

197
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:04,410
that if as I equals 2 as J then it means

198
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:07,139
that the random tape in the X execution

199
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,910
is the same as that in the JZ iteration

200
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:14,480
you

201
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:17,990
in the yeah now the number of patterns

202
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,450
is bounded by T 30 which means leaking

203
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,580
the patterning information only leaks T

204
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:28,010
log T which is bounded by T times T

205
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:30,110
piece of X given the pattern I read two

206
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,390
terminal functions sorry I read to

207
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,240
tempura tempura random tips are either

208
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,760
always the same which can be handled by

209
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,740
the result both your knowledge are

210
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:46,250
always different which can be handled by

211
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:48,800
choristers instructors therefore our

212
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,340
panel construction of courage' tips your

213
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,040
knowledge is the following

214
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,470
he actually each execution the prover

215
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,270
first applies a curry sauce instructor

216
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:04,370
on its random tape and the seed to use

217
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,620
the result as a new random tape in this

218
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:14,570
execution and invoke a reset both the

219
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:16,630
knowledge protocol with the verifier now

220
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,900
we give an overview of our construction

221
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,360
there are three steps so first we

222
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,620
generate an otherwise verges otherwise

223
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,960
we'll get the extraction process later

224
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:34,640
then we prick the original source acts

225
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:37,340
into to our limited color hit parts the

226
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,860
resulting sauces are paired up and our

227
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,610
extraction process starts from the first

228
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:51,350
pair X 1 X 2 to the last pair X 2 L

229
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:53,210
minus 1 and X 2 L in the first step till

230
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,480
the wise is generated by using the

231
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,750
source and a fresh piece from the seed

232
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,340
it satisfies that with high probability

233
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:05,360
this otherwise is different from arid

234
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,250
tempered 1 so this idea is not new and

235
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:14,630
has been widely used in the construction

236
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:17,720
of normal voice tractors soon to break

237
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:21,770
the sauce into several limited career

238
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:28,010
parts we use the strong city destructor

239
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:36,710
with fresh seeds each time and here is

240
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:40,160
the case for tempura sauce now we have

241
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,330
to our times t plus 1000 in total they

242
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,390
are paired up in the following manner

243
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:52,850
each column of sauces are denoted by a

244
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:55,449
set Chi we not set the sources in

245
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,880
different sets are generated by using

246
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:05,690
different and independent seeds

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:08,840
therefore for our J XJ is a uniform even

248
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:17,990
given all the sauces except those in the

249
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:20,570
same set as XJ now our instructions

250
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,590
precise start from the first pair to the

251
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:28,820
last pair in the GC the region X 2j

252
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:31,820
minus 1 and X 2 G will be used depending

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:37,430
on the J speeds of the otherwise one of

254
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:39,580
the source is chosen then we apply

255
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,410
instructor on the children source and

256
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:48,710
afresh as our end result in the last

257
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:53,270
division to get W J finally we apply

258
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:56,930
another extractor on w g and a fresh

259
00:14:53,270 --> 00:15:04,189
piece from the seed GG will be the final

260
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:06,199
result in this iteration a general

261
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,060
picture of our extraction process is the

262
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,310
following so the first seed c0 comes

263
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:18,109
from the seed because there is no inter

264
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:21,910
vision 0 and the final result CL will be

265
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,910
the output of the instructor

266
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:33,639
now to show that our construction is

267
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:35,079
indeed a carissa tractor it is

268
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:41,229
sufficient to show the following two

269
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:45,008
properties first if the J's bits of the

270
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:48,249
otherwise is different from that of a

271
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:51,009
temper one then we should be able to

272
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:56,229
break the correlations between them in

273
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:59,379
the jzt region once we break the

274
00:15:56,229 --> 00:16:01,719
correlations we should be able to make

275
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:07,869
sure this independence remain till the

276
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:10,059
end of the extraction process so we

277
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:14,289
first point out two important effects of

278
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:18,639
extractors for two stars is X and X

279
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:22,479
prime if given X from X Q has enough me

280
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,779
entropy then the result of extracting X

281
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:28,209
using the seed of Y is independent of

282
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:32,589
the results of extracting explain using

283
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:35,378
the same seed Y to see this when we

284
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,869
first fix the second source X front and

285
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:43,389
in this case X still has enough me

286
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:45,849
entropy then the result of extracting X

287
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:48,849
using the city of Y is independent of

288
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:54,909
the seed Y and also the second source X

289
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:59,589
from and therefore the second result now

290
00:16:54,909 --> 00:17:03,069
for mm X and X from if X itself has

291
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:05,529
enough me entropy then the result of

292
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,740
extracting X using the seed Y one is

293
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:12,398
independent of death of extracting X

294
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,919
from using another state Y 2 this is

295
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:18,579
because when we first fix the second

296
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,039
results and in this case X still has

297
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:24,178
enough the entropy to use the instructor

298
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,179
with a uniform seed

299
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,139
now for the first property we compare

300
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,639
the extraction processes in the JC

301
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,730
duration we note sets in the second

302
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,410
level of abstraction to use the same

303
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:53,900
random seed white g2

304
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:57,300
therefore if we can show that given wji

305
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:02,750
WJ still has enough me entropy then we

306
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:08,639
are done w3 is determined by two parts a

307
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:11,850
temporal source and the J minus 1 I so

308
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,440
we set the length of C to be much

309
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:20,149
shorter than the length of W that means

310
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,490
fixing C only fixes a small amounts of W

311
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:29,480
therefore it is okay to fix the Jamis

312
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:33,900
one I as for the temperature source

313
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,870
note that the J's piece of the other

314
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:41,100
wises are different which means these

315
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:44,070
two sources come from different sets so

316
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,080
when we first fix the tempura sources in

317
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,270
the beginning and if you will not

318
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,870
influence the extraction process of the

319
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,870
original one

320
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:06,690
now for the second property by induction

321
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:10,500
we have C G prime minus 1 and the 3

322
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:13,230
premise 1 I are independent therefore by

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:17,460
the second effect about instructor the

324
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:21,570
result WJ Prem is independent of W 3

325
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:26,210
prime i and also we have g g prime x r

326
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,210
ett frame is in lebanon of DT prime i

327
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,820
finally we would like to point out to

328
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:39,210
future directions so one direction is to

329
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,360
discover more applications of corridors

330
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,370
instructors we believe curry sauce

331
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,080
instructor is a very natural notion and

332
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:51,000
we will have many other applications and

333
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,490
the other direction is to construct a

334
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,530
curry sauce instructor to match our

335
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,530
existence is the essential results

336
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:09,170
that's all thank you

337
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:09,169
[Applause]

338
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:48,399
yeah so well of our goal is to construct

339
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:50,229
a choristers instructor starts that the

340
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:55,149
seedlings does not grow with the number

341
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:58,119
of the executions but for to 2011

342
00:20:55,149 --> 00:21:01,978
structures both sources grow with the

343
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:06,009
number of the executions so like in our

344
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:08,019
application we only need a very short

345
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,319
seat which is independent of the

346
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:13,499
executions but if we use 2002

347
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,639
instructors soon we need to first know

348
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:19,509
the number of executions in the

349
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:21,758
beginning to generate the seep yeah have

350
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,709
you tried to use like college to

351
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:27,039
extractors to construct to source

352
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:29,979
extractor the other direction no we

353
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,249
didn't consider this case because so for

354
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:36,190
carita stores instructor a big advantage

355
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:38,349
in designing is that we can break the

356
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,459
seeds into several parts and each part

357
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:43,928
is still uniform but for 2011 structures

358
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:48,579
that is not the case

359
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:49,710
yeah ok thank you so let's thank the

360
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:54,579
speaker again and

361
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,579
[Applause]
