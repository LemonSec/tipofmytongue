1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,060
through the magic of wireless technology

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,189
I'm going to stand here so I'm going to

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,019
talk about quantum advantage in single

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,210
server information theoretic fear and

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,299
this is joint work with the Rita Ora

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,600
Nova Kai Ming Chang il green Chingy

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,480
atching LA and orsa tot so we're going

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,070
to talk about single server private

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,660
information which we've also let's sort

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,430
of recall the set up even though I

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,859
believe that most of you have seen this

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,560
before so what we have is a server that

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,700
holds a database and the database is big

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,530
it contains capital and entries and we

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,110
have a client that has some index and

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,800
and the client wants to recover the jth

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,289
element from this from this database and

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,629
what we want is a protocol that will

19
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,579
allow the client to recover the JS

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,250
element in the database in a private way

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,350
so in such a way that the server does

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,460
not learn any information about Jai at

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,649
least this is sort of the intuitive

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,949
notion of private information retrieval

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,610
is the notion of privacy so we want to

26
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,470
want to get such a protocol and so we

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,479
have correctness and privacy

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,920
requirements and in this talk I'm just

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,830
going to talk about perfect correctness

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,920
and perfect privacy we can this can of

31
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,350
course be relaxed but it adds like you

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,170
know orders of magnitudes of complexity

33
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,820
so we're talking about perfect security

34
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,500
so no information about J is being

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880
leaked and perfect correctness so the

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,100
correct value is always being learned

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,329
and the question is how much

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,229
communication do you need in order to

39
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,460
perform this task

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,840
so of course one trivial strategy is for

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,009
the server to send the entire database

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,840
like Capital n bits of or elements of

43
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,689
information and the question is whether

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,270
it's possible to do it with less what

45
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,369
less communication optimally you would

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,079
want something like log n bits of

47
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,119
communication because well just

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,639
information theoretically specifying the

49
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,670
index J takes something like log n bits

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,530
or takes log n bits exactly so this

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,290
would be sort of the optimal goal and

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,210
the question is one question the first

53
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,640
question that you would ask is whether

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,989
this is possible to achieve information

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,299
theoretically so in our case even

56
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,650
perfectly with perfect privacy and

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,060
perfect correctness

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,170
and once you think about it for a second

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,659
you realize that this should be

60
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,569
impossible at least sort of in the more

61
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,519
well studied model of classical

62
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,530
communication and the reason is because

63
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,840
the transcript does not reveal any

64
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,030
information about the index J then this

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,250
means that we can essentially sample J

66
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,079
after the fact so the client is not

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,659
actually committed to the value J so

68
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,159
after executing with a server you can

69
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,010
decide well actually the value J as I

70
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,470
want is well J close 1 J equals to J

71
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,548
equals 3 and because of the because of

72
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,959
the correctness he's actually going to

73
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,180
be able to recover the entire database

74
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,040
without any additional communication so

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,459
just based on executing the protocol

76
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,230
once so this is not possible with

77
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,430
classical communication so the next

78
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,409
question that you would ask well at

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,900
least in this session is whether it's

80
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,849
possible to use quantum communication to

81
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,189
help so what do I mean by a quantum

82
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,619
communication protocol well now instead

83
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,150
of just exchanging classical bits the

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,909
client and the server can also exchange

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,250
qubits or quantum information and

86
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,420
they're also allowed quantum and they're

87
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,540
also allowed quantum communication

88
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,828
quantum computation sorry I should say

89
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,900
that even though we're talking about

90
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,370
information theoretic setting whenever I

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,690
will talk about algorithms I will

92
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,069
present efficient algorithms and

93
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,049
whenever I will talk about impossibility

94
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,328
results impossibility results will also

95
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,310
hold against unbounded unbounded

96
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,680
entities so the fact that we're talking

97
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,949
about information theoretic setting does

98
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,500
not actually sort of take away anything

99
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:41,849
so why would you hope even that quantum

100
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,220
communication can help in this setting

101
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,548
so when you think about quantum

102
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,620
information or qubits then you realize

103
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,319
that unlike classical information

104
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,959
quantum quantum information in general

105
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
cannot be copied where so this means

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,620
that this sort of notion of I'm going to

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,478
keep this transcript on the side and use

108
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,150
it many times well you need to think a

109
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,909
little bit about how to actually sort of

110
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,099
generalize this argument in addition the

111
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,569
process of measurement actually allows

112
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,060
you to destroy information in the

113
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,409
quantum setting so this is again

114
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,048
something that could be useful when you

115
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,988
talk about privacy the ability to sort

116
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,159
of destroy information in a way that is

117
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,250
not recoverable information

118
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:25,740
theoretically so you would think that

119
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,270
perhaps quantum quantum communication

120
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,710
can help in the setting

121
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,349
but sort of when you think about a

122
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,870
little more you actually realize that

123
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,759
for a reasonable model this should not

124
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,699
be doable and this is a long sequence of

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,060
works actually starting with low in 97 I

126
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,060
will talk a little bit more about it

127
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,020
so you can actually think about this

128
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,300
generalization of the classical argument

129
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,830
I described before but the way that I

130
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
will present it is actually sort of in a

131
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,318
slightly different way that will be more

132
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,810
useful for our purposes but let's not

133
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,970
give up just yet so there are some

134
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,800
restricted models where you can actually

135
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,990
show some quantum advantage so for

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,759
example you can assume some structure on

137
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,250
the database but this is not the setting

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,990
that we're going to talk about today

139
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,509
what I do want to mention is at least

140
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,409
two works by legal and by Kerr and it is

141
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:19,469
at all that do give some protocol that

142
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:21,630
has non-trivial communication complexity

143
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,030
but the privacy model is actually not

144
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,680
very clear in these in these works and

145
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,508
the tension between these two things

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,430
sort of made us sort of try to think

147
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,469
whether it is possible to define a

148
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,940
meaningful model where these positive

149
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:35,460
results actually do make sense and do

150
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,770
imply some notion of privacy or you know

151
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,388
whether you can just sort of put it in a

152
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,609
trash I think sort of the way that

153
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,319
legalities presents his work is he shows

154
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,849
this protocol and analyzes this protocol

155
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,740
and then says well here's a reason why

156
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,750
this protocol is useless so we're saying

157
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,180
you know let's let's wait a second and

158
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,779
think for a bit more before like putting

159
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,520
these things away so let me talk a

160
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,099
little bit about the attack the

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,400
superposition attack and as I said this

162
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:04,169
method was used in many variants to sort

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,508
of show impossibility for many

164
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:07,770
cryptographic applications in the

165
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,300
information theory in a purely

166
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,710
information theoretic setting so

167
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,960
starting with commit wins

168
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,210
I think the first work that considered

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,739
to some extent private information

170
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,198
retrieval is by Nyack the same work that

171
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,630
where he showed impossibility of random

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,380
access codes and last work that I know

173
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:28,229
of is by Bao Miller and Broadbent in

174
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,199
2015 so let's consider a quantum

175
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,789
protocol and our protocol I'm going to

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,830
talk about Pierre specifically it has

177
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,389
classical functionality so we can think

178
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,460
about a classical database its input in

179
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,669
a classical index as their as the input

180
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,280
for the client

181
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,448
and the functionality is that for any

182
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,739
classical database

183
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,229
we're guaranteed that the client should

184
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,159
learn the JC element of the database so

185
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,800
what is the attack

186
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,300
so rather than executing the product

187
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,889
rather than executing the protocol on a

188
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,050
classical database you're actually

189
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,259
actually executing it on a superposition

190
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,819
of databases and one the first thing is

191
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,699
that you might think that this might not

192
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,590
be well defined however because the

193
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,300
original protocol is well defined for

194
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,859
classical inputs then you can actually

195
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,810
sort of extended you can think about it

196
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,909
as sort of a classically controlled

197
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,550
quantum circuit and extend it to a

198
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:17,889
unitary that actually applies also to

199
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,560
well to a superposition so this is a

200
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,389
minor technicality this can be done and

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,860
what you get when you apply it when you

202
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,050
apply the protocol in superposition is

203
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,840
sort of a superposition of executions of

204
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,689
the protocol how does this help well or

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,568
how does this help in showing something

206
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,699
bad so one thing that you can say is

207
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,889
that in this execution will over

208
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,419
superposition in the end we're required

209
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,430
that the client actually learned some

210
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,560
value it learns the J's entry of the

211
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,469
database and this actually means that

212
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,000
the J's entry of the superposition will

213
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,469
actually collapse to a classical value

214
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,029
because the the client actually learned

215
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:55,389
some value and this value needs to be

216
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:58,149
consistent with the database that with a

217
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,039
database array that the server holds so

218
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:02,020
we know that J's entry is going to be is

219
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,639
going to collapse on the other hand

220
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,020
since the communication complexity is

221
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,969
low then in a sense we know that the

222
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,188
superposition of databases behaves like

223
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:15,189
a superposition that don't call doesn't

224
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:18,370
collapse much and through the magic of

225
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,259
quantum Fourier transform you can

226
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,569
actually sort of translate these two

227
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,279
statements into the following things so

228
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,169
the fact that most entries do not

229
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,029
collapse means that after you perform

230
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:31,120
Fourier transform almost the entire

231
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:33,250
array is going to be is going to be 0

232
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,469
and the fact that the J's entry did

233
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,969
collapse means that actually in the J's

234
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,190
entry you're going to get a random value

235
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,839
so putting these two together it means

236
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,640
that the server can actually learn the

237
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,459
value J and the parameter sort of

238
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,390
depends on what you assume on the

239
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:51,369
communication complexity and correctness

240
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:53,319
and and security so this is this is the

241
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,300
superposition attack and

242
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,370
shows sort of a pretty strong privacy

243
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:04,390
pretty strong privacy violation so we

244
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:07,560
know that this is not this so this is

245
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,880
why we think that why people think that

246
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,569
quantum has no quantum communication has

247
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,200
no advantage in this setting but let's

248
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:20,650
let's try to sort of try to think about

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
the model of privacy that we a model a

250
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,920
reasonable model of privacy or the

251
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,480
weakest possible model of privacy that

252
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,819
we can think of that actually makes

253
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,250
sense and see what happens when we try

254
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,280
to apply this attack so let's talk about

255
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,550
sort of I guess honesty and curiosity in

256
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,860
in the quantum in the quantum setting so

257
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:43,660
as I said we do know of these

258
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,280
non-trivial protocols so legal presented

259
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,110
a protocol with square root of n

260
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,839
communication complexity between the

261
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,960
client and the server and Kennedy said

262
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,610
I'll they showed a protocol with

263
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,840
actually like almost perfect

264
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,750
communication complexity up to a

265
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,520
constant so only ov login but they did

266
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,410
not do it in the sort of standard model

267
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,250
that I described here they require some

268
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,530
set up so they require that the server

269
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,080
and client pre share some quantum

270
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,480
correlation or entanglement between them

271
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,300
in particular this entanglement needs to

272
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,360
be pretty big so you need capital n of

273
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,550
these so-called EPR pairs in order to

274
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,840
execute their protocol however these EPR

275
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,520
pairs of course do not depend on the

276
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,860
input and actually as we show in our

277
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,449
paper they can also be reused so after

278
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,420
you continue after you're done executing

279
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,490
the protocol you can actually recover

280
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,040
the the set up at least if the serving

281
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,500
client cooperate and reuse the protocol

282
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,589
and rerun the protocol so this is a

283
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,590
slightly stronger model to require a set

284
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,170
up but you get a much stronger result in

285
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,790
terms of communication complexity so

286
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,120
what can you show about what can you

287
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,370
show about these protocols so what was

288
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,110
shown at least in lekars paper so the

289
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,010
currently digital paper doesn't talk

290
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,840
about it talks about quantum information

291
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,730
quantum information cost and the privacy

292
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,780
is only a tool that is used there

293
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,059
they're talking about mutual information

294
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,589
so I think this specific

295
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:12,159
Alice does not appear there but it can

296
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:14,379
be done and what you what at least legal

297
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:19,289
shows is that for any database in any

298
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:21,519
index J after any after any message

299
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:24,159
after any sort of message that is

300
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,219
exchanged in this protocol the local

301
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,309
state of the server is independent of

302
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:32,739
the value J and or you know if you want

303
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:36,368
to be fancy the density matrix of the

304
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:38,829
sort of marginal marginal state of the

305
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,959
server is independent of the value J

306
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:43,238
that the client holds and this is true

307
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,319
for any database for any classical

308
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:51,459
database in any classical index J so

309
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:54,189
this is uh this is you know one notion

310
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:56,348
of of security that that you can think

311
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:59,889
of but it's it's actually kind of weak

312
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:04,149
because well it allows oh at least it

313
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:06,489
gives rise to some notion that I'll call

314
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:08,919
the honest model the honest model so

315
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:11,259
normally you know in cryptography we try

316
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,089
to talk about honest but curious but

317
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,669
let's try to think about a purely honest

318
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:18,489
a purely honest model in this context

319
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:21,549
and in the in the purely honest model we

320
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:24,219
just assume that the server plays by the

321
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:27,399
rules completely and we want to argue

322
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:30,869
that even in this case the the

323
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,869
information that is learned about J is

324
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,889
is zero so you don't get any information

325
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,079
you don't get any information about J

326
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,759
and let me emphasize that's actually

327
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,878
important to require that this holds

328
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,949
after any after any message that's

329
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,509
exchanged in the protocol because well

330
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,579
as I said quantum information can be

331
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,009
destroyed so you can say like even

332
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:52,779
trivially the client could just send J

333
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,539
to the server the server is going to

334
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,279
send back the value D the value of the

335
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:59,409
database in J and then afterwards

336
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,749
measure in the Hadamard basis which

337
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:03,909
essentially means that you eliminate all

338
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:06,069
the information about J so in the end of

339
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,109
the execution the server does not have

340
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:10,478
any information about J but still we

341
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:12,669
don't view this as sort of even even

342
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:15,159
this is not even honest privacy I would

343
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:17,529
say so we want to require that at any

344
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:18,999
point in time the server does not does

345
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,740
not have any information about

346
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,390
information about J

347
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,850
so this is what I call this is what I

348
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,620
call honest privacy and actually you can

349
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,210
think about like a slightly stronger

350
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,040
version because I told you that the

351
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,270
server can destroy information in the

352
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,339
end of the product in the end of the

353
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,480
protocol but perhaps it's also not fair

354
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,880
to ask of it to destroy information

355
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,580
during the protocol so you can think

356
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,780
about a purified honest model where we

357
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,190
just assumed that the server cannot

358
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,689
perform any cannot perform any

359
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:48,760
measurement so this is sort of the

360
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,710
honest model however the standard model

361
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,500
that people normally consider for quante

362
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,900
protocols is called specious privacy and

363
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,090
this is somewhat stronger model there

364
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,800
you sort of assumed that the server is

365
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,210
allowed to have in our case that this is

366
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,520
defined for general protocols but I'm

367
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,740
going to talk about peer the server is

368
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,350
allowed to have a secret drawer where he

369
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,310
can sort of hide information and what

370
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,680
we're going to say we're going to

371
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,119
require that at any point in time we can

372
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,099
sort of call up the server and say we're

373
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,540
coming to do an inspection and then the

374
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,400
server can sort of tidy up the lab and

375
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,959
put whatever he wants in the drawer but

376
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,300
then we come to the server's lab and

377
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,190
takes the server state and also take the

378
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,990
clients they take these the joint state

379
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,280
together and compare it to what was

380
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,190
supposed to have happened in the honest

381
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,900
protocol and at any point in time the

382
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,810
server should be able to sort of tidy up

383
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,730
the lab in order to produce a joint stay

384
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,930
that is consistent with the state of of

385
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:43,030
an honest execution so this is the the

386
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,290
specious model and again this is sort of

387
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:49,390
quantified over over all possible inputs

388
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,270
so this is this is clearly a stronger

389
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,550
model and for example if you want to

390
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,689
talk about the superposition attack that

391
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,939
we described before

392
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,860
well again you could say well when we

393
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,710
come to the when we come to the server's

394
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,020
lab we're going to check whether the the

395
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,330
state of the database register is in

396
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,810
superposition or not however you could

397
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,490
think about what a purifying register so

398
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,810
you can think about generating a state

399
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,670
and this is actually what happens if you

400
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,380
just think about an EPR pair so if you

401
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,060
think about an EPR pair if you look at

402
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,160
the marginal distribution of each bit

403
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,020
then it looks completely uniform so if I

404
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,310
take an EPR pair and put one of the bits

405
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,810
in the drawer and just show you one of

406
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,209
them then you think that I just

407
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,310
generated the classical random bit

408
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,230
however when I take the second bit out

409
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,479
of the drawer then I can actually sort

410
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,100
of recover the original superposition

411
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,019
and the superposition attack can

412
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,069
actually be executed in the specious

413
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:44,139
model and this is sort of why in this

414
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:47,049
sort of reasonable model you cannot get

415
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:49,859
you cannot get any quantum advantage for

416
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:52,569
for private information retrieval I

417
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:54,489
should say that sometimes people refer

418
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,769
to specious privacy as the quantum

419
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,739
analog of honest bicurious or semi

420
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:01,269
honest maybe it's the closest analogue

421
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:03,489
that exists but actually specious

422
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:05,139
privacy is stronger and you can define

423
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:07,299
species privacy also in the classical

424
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,489
setting and there's a very simple

425
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,919
example that's in this duper I'll paper

426
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:13,749
that shows that species privacy even in

427
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,379
the classical setting is stronger than

428
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:21,970
semi honest so this is just sort of

429
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:24,519
pedagogical remark so let's try to think

430
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,529
in the context of these in the context

431
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,869
of these definitions that we discussed

432
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,179
what can we say how can we sort of

433
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:32,829
relate the notion that we get the the

434
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,399
privacy notion that we get from these

435
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:38,919
non-trivial protocols to these to these

436
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,709
notion notions that we just discussed

437
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,529
and one thing that we can that we can

438
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:47,579
see is that here I said that in the in

439
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:51,699
the non-trivial protocols I said that

440
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:54,039
this condition holds for any database

441
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,868
and for any value j and by that i mean

442
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,689
every classical database in every value

443
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:59,919
j whereas both when i both in the honest

444
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,029
case and definitely in the specious case

445
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,589
the honest case i don't think it's

446
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,769
defined in literature but definitely in

447
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,510
the specious case you are allowing the

448
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:09,279
you are allowing the input to be in

449
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,049
superposition and you allow exhilarate

450
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,980
input which effectively allows the input

451
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:17,260
to be in superposition so there is there

452
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,610
is some gap here which sort of leads to

453
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,099
our attempt to define to define a model

454
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,569
that is both as close as possible to

455
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:31,658
this specious model and also captures

456
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:35,440
non-trivial non non-trivial properties

457
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:37,240
of the quantum quantum setting so the

458
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,250
first result that we show is this new

459
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,610
weak privacy model and we call this

460
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,379
anchored privacy and the the point in

461
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,658
this model is just to not allow the

462
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:48,370
input to be the input of the server to

463
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:51,940
be in superposition

464
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,139
so this is uh this is essentially

465
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,210
different the definition of the model

466
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,650
I'm going to talk about it a bit more

467
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:02,620
and the next slide and what we show is

468
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,540
that the previous the previous protocols

469
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,969
you can show that they're anchored

470
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,310
honest and proof so this anchored thing

471
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,290
just essentially means that the input of

472
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,120
the server must be classical so you can

473
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,530
sort of adapt it to the honest setting

474
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,969
and also to the spacious setting and

475
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,670
hopefully in the future for more

476
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,310
settings and what you can see is that

477
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,290
well just by observing the analysis that

478
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,960
was done before or redoing the analysis

479
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:30,070
for the second algorithm you can show

480
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,510
that if the if the protocol keeps the

481
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,950
server pure so if the server does not

482
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,600
perform any measurements in the protocol

483
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,170
which is indeed the case in those

484
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,520
protocols that I discussed then you can

485
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,120
sort of prove that it's going to be

486
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,030
securing this anchored honest model we

487
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,830
then show that if you have a protocol

488
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,680
that is secure in this in this model so

489
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,230
this anchored honest model is actually

490
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,840
does actually imply privacy also in the

491
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,610
anchored species model so actually if

492
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,750
you're preventing this superposition

493
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,070
attack so the only thing you're not

494
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,190
allowing to put your input in

495
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,470
superposition then in fact the honest

496
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,330
model actually converges with a specious

497
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:13,210
model so maybe this sort of the may be

498
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,919
anchored honest seems kind of weak but

499
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,030
anchored species well hopefully it seems

500
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,190
slightly less weak so this this actually

501
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,139
shows that in a sense the superposition

502
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,330
attack is the only thing that stops you

503
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,550
from getting from getting protocols with

504
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,889
perfect communication complexity because

505
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,450
we know that we have there exist

506
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,440
protocols in this model with

507
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,360
communication with logarithmic

508
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,400
communication complexity although with

509
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,580
this little star that you need the pre

510
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,130
shared entanglement the last thing we

511
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,990
show is a lower bound for one-sided

512
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,880
communication which essentially helps us

513
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,410
to show that this pre shared

514
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,290
entanglement actually doesn't help much

515
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,180
in its the the reason why we are able to

516
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,159
get were able to get stronger results is

517
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:59,290
not because the pre is not because the

518
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,410
pre shared entanglement so let me talk a

519
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,500
little bit more about the anchor

520
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,020
species privacy so we put an anchor on

521
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,050
the on the database entry we force the

522
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,420
database to be to be a classical value

523
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,310
not in super position and in terms of

524
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,630
making it a formal definition it's

525
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,460
actually not very hard you just take the

526
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,640
definition of species and add an

527
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,550
additional requirement that the the

528
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,380
state of the state of the register that

529
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,419
holds the database has to be some

530
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,590
classical value especially a specific

531
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,780
classical value and again what we showed

532
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,230
is that if the server is pure so it does

533
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,060
not perform any measurement then

534
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,600
anchored honest privacy also implies

535
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,790
anchored species species privacy so just

536
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,230
having this hidden drawer does not

537
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,139
actually is not actually going to help

538
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,110
you and let me sort of briefly explain

539
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,400
why but before as I said before before I

540
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,740
do that let me say that as I said before

541
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,600
this could be some indication that you

542
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,400
know this superposition attack is in is

543
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,350
very strong but it's perhaps or of the

544
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,340
only strong tool though we have the only

545
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,820
strong tool that prevents us from

546
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,280
getting the so whenever this attack does

547
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,610
not apply you can hope to get very good

548
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,860
communication complexity for PA so the

549
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,570
proof idea uses at least I like to think

550
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,840
about it is a variant of this notion of

551
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:24,510
monogamy of entanglement so what we're

552
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,300
saying is that if the if the server is

553
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,030
pure we can does not perform it or does

554
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,149
not perform any measurement and the

555
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,190
client and the client is also can also

556
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,570
always be made pure because we don't

557
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,600
have any privacy requirement from the

558
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,510
client then the joint the honest joint

559
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,350
client-server state is also going to

560
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:49,560
always be a pure state and we know that

561
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,030
if you have a pure state then even if

562
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,639
you have like an additional register in

563
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,379
the drawer then the these two registers

564
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,480
has to be have to be tensor products of

565
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,130
each other so the additional information

566
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,660
that you have in the drawer is not

567
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,150
actually going to be correlated at all

568
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,830
with the sort of the information that

569
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,300
you need to show for the inspection so

570
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,169
you might as well not put anything in

571
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,480
the drawer and therefore the convergence

572
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,300
of the notions of species and honest

573
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,070
privacy in this in this case

574
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,450
so this is the definition and this is

575
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,250
what we can do with it but let's take a

576
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,890
step back I can ask well does it even

577
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,720
make sense to make this definition I

578
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,010
don't have super strong argument but

579
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,310
lets me let me try to convince you

580
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,560
anyway so first of all I'm at least it's

581
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,270
not trivial to write it down I mean you

582
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,940
can you can write it and stare at it and

583
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:40,300
doesn't immediately immediately seem

584
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,910
trivial but moreover I don't think it's

585
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,129
completely contrived so does it make

586
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,450
sense with foreseeable quantum

587
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,680
technology I don't know what is

588
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,240
foreseeable quantum technology I'm sure

589
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,040
other people are more qualified to

590
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,810
answer than me but one could imagine

591
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,360
this day one could imagine the state of

592
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,399
affairs where you're forced to store

593
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,110
your your for the server's force to

594
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,730
store their data based on some media

595
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,500
that cannot be easily placed in

596
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,690
superposition I don't know think about

597
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,820
taking your database and just writing it

598
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,430
on a piece of paper it's going to be

599
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,020
pretty hard for an adversary to put put

600
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,290
a piece of paper and superposition

601
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,960
between all possible values so you could

602
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,250
maybe think that in some settings this

603
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,850
is actually something that you can

604
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:26,770
enforce also as a sort of just for in

605
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,870
terms of scientific inquiry right we

606
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,260
want to understand the state of the art

607
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,689
this was the motivation for this for

608
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,640
this entire study we want to understand

609
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,460
this tension between the strong negative

610
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,680
results and these weird positive results

611
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,160
and this is one formal and this is one

612
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,290
formal way of making it of sort of

613
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,730
formalizing this connection Edie

614
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,320
hopefully this is going to be a stepping

615
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,140
stone for stronger notion I'm going to

616
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,179
talk about it in my last slide about

617
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,610
open problems so I'm skipping the slide

618
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,780
about the lower bound on one-sided

619
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:03,969
communication complexity you can see

620
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:05,590
that in the paper so this is we think

621
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,710
about this just again just as a first

622
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,480
step you can think of trying to find out

623
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,820
that we have a model of security can you

624
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,500
come up with better quantum peer in this

625
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,149
signed a small in the honest model in

626
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,830
the anchored model so can you get log n

627
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:25,210
communication without entanglement again

628
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,770
in this weak model and these protocols

629
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,160
actually require multiple rounds of

630
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,170
communication

631
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,870
as sort of the protocols that we like or

632
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,950
just two rounds message from the client

633
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,840
to the server and then a message back

634
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,310
can you get the single round protocol

635
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,770
with non-trivial with non-trivial

636
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:42,950
properties I should say that the Kennedy

637
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,990
said I'll paper actually has a protocol

638
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,320
that we that we don't analyze that gives

639
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,020
poly log communication complexity

640
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,520
without entanglement but again they work

641
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,290
in a different model and one should

642
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,540
check whether it holds in in this

643
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,560
anchored species model as well I would

644
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,850
guess that yes but this is just a guess

645
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,820
extending this anchored notion to the

646
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,770
malicious setting so we have some ideas

647
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,980
but we don't have any results in these

648
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,330
models and perhaps once you have this

649
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,790
notion you can think about other

650
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,260
applications other than peer for example

651
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,460
fully homework like information

652
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,350
theoretic fully homomorphic encryption

653
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,960
is something that comes to mind

654
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,300
can you come come up with a weak yet

655
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:33,370
meaningful model where this is possible

656
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:33,370
thank you we have time for one question

657
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:45,060
I admittedly I haven't read your paper

658
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,490
so I should track the details first

659
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,520
but the model kind of reminds me a

660
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,050
little bit of quantum oblivious runs if

661
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,960
you have ever heard of it

662
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,180
so we're logarithmic communication

663
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,370
complexity is also possible so I was

664
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,760
wondering if you can tell us something

665
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,080
about the difference or if you have

666
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,670
looked at it so I don't know about

667
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,580
quantum oblivious Ram but I mean I do

668
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,020
know of oblivia oblivia Sturm so there

669
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:15,929
you want to say that the access pattern

670
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:17,129
mmm so I guess the the my answer is that

671
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,150
the connection should be the same as the

672
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:25,070
connection of classical private

673
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:30,500
information retrieval and and an O Ram

674
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:33,540
so one thing is that in in a ram the

675
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,990
although although all the sorry all that

676
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,129
the server sees is the physical access

677
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,930
pattern right and you want to hide the

678
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,910
logical access pattern i hear the server

679
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,310
also sees the sort of the internals of

680
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,500
the database this is sort of what comes

681
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,460
to mind but the these models are

682
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,540
different and i imagine that they are

683
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,060
different in the quantum setting as well

684
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,530
so one would i would need to think about

685
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,129
the definition for a second before I can

686
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,690
say sure thank you

687
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:02,539
let's sing the speaker again

688
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,539
[Applause]
