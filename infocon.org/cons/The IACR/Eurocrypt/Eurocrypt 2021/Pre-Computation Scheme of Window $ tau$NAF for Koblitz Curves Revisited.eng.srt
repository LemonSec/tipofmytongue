00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,679
collaboration work with professor xi

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,399
my topic today is pre-computation scheme

the outer line of my presentation is as

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
follows

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,680
first

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
a brief introduction

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
of this work

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
secondly

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,359
we introduced problems map talk

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,400
thirdly

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
we introduce the complex

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
conjugate

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
and the present efficient formulae

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,759
of

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
the complex conjugate

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
firstly

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
we propose noble

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,240
scheme

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,079
later

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,280
we discuss gala multiplication

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
using the new new proposed

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,920
pre-computation scheme

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,119
uncovered the curves

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,840
finally we conclude

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
this work

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,520
first

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
we introduce

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,680
our work

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
has draw intensive attention

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,560
from the literature

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
the family of companies curves

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
proposed

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
by linear companies

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,239
a non-super singular course

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
defined over binary fields

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
the arithmetic

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
of calculus curves

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
has been of theoretical and a practical

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
significance

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
since the start of the edible global

56

cherry photography

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,959
four colonies curves

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
were recommended to be used in digital

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319

and a key management

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
finest

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
this indicates that

65
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,000
coverless curves

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,879
can still be useful

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,599
in practice

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
probably the course

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,560
has a computational advantage

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
that a fast scale multiplication

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
can be achieved

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
by replacing

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
pointer doubling

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
with throbbing smack

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
the carbonyl curves

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,319
are given as the following

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
equation

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
this occurs can be considered over the

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
binary is a tension

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,840
since

81

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
then

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
there has a factor p

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
p is the cardinality

it's of great interest

255
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
to consider the use of new four coverage

inspired by their elegant results

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,839
we introduce a new

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
under this ratings

279
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
we design new formulas

280
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,440
which only required two multiplication

281
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
and two squares

282
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
first lens we proved that when point

283
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
addition is necessary

284
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
for computing each pre-computation point

285
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
we use our new

286
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
operation to replace

287
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
point additions of

288
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
mixed additions

289
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
in pre-computation scale

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
as the cost

291
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
of one addition

292
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,560
costs more than our new operation

293
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
our formulas

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
our new point of operation

299
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
are part of

w formula

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
it may lead to a simplicity

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,320
of the implementation

303
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,560
to several more field

311
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639

six multiplication

313
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,320

the practical implementations

330

show that our pre-computation

is two

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,880
at the present our pre-computation

336

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
the pre-computation cost and affects

the overall performance

the standard art pre-computation scheme

349
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,440
suggests to use wireless at the most six

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,440
this

363
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
allows us

364
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,639
to use a big window

365
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,320
wise

366
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
for example 7 together fastest gala

367
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,759
multiplication

368
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,760
the balance between the pre-computation

369
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
part

370
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
and the other part of scalar

371
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,919
multiplication

372
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
shows that

373
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
the pre-computation

374
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
takes a bigger radius of circular

375
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
multiplication than before

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
this is useful

377
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,360
especially for circular multiplication

378
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
with unfixed

379
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
point

380
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
and predict scala multiplication

381
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
using

382
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,480
our novel pre-competency

383
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
and with a

384
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,880
big window window-wise

385
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
is this leather art

386
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
on coverless curves

387
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
now we briefly conclude this work

388
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
this paper introduced

389
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,559
new relics

390
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
on company's curves

391
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,720
efficient formulae

392
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
of the new radius

393
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
as in d5

394
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,879
use the noble pre-computation skill

395
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,640
our precomputation skin

396
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
is about

397
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,200
two times fast

398
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,760
compared to the study of the

399
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,559
state-of-the-art

400
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,320
technical

401
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
of pre-computation scheme

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
in the literature

403
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,320
the impact of our new efficient nuclear

404
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
computation

405
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
is also

406
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
reflected

407
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,000
by the

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
significant improvement

409
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,520
of scala multiplication

410
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,960
traditionally

411
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
we neutral knife

412
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,760
with the widest and most of the 6

413
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
is used to

414
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,120
achieve the best scalar multiplication

415
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
because of the

416
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
dramatic cost reduction

417
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
of the proposed

418
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
pre-computation scheme

419
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
we are able to

420
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,120
increase the widens for window tall

421
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
knife

422
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,360
to serving for bad scalar multiplication

423
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
this indicates that

424
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,280
super computation part becomes more

425
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
important

426
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,919
in performing cigar multiplication

427
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
with our efficient precomputation screen

428
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
and

429
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,520
the new window wireless

430
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
our scala multiplication

431
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,840
runs in at least

432
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
85 percent the time

433
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
of kah's work

434
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,520
combining the

435
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
best of the previous pre-computation

436
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
our results

437
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,039
pushed the scalar multiplication of

438
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
companies groups

439
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
a very well studied

440
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,880
a long

441
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,240
standing

442
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
research area

443
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
to a significant

444
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
new study

445
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
this is

446
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,520
all i want to share any questions please

447
