1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to the talk my name is heinrich

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
i'm going to talk about naked resilience

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,880
of the championship exchange themes

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,519
against physical beat leakages

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,719
this year's joy work with mashi anat

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,679
ham and meanwhile

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
so let me start with the notion of

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
liquid resilient secret sharing

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,480
in a classical setting

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
a charter dealer takes a secret test and

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
samples n random secrets s1 has 2 10

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
the security guarantees that

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,840
any unauthorized set of chess reveals no

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
information about the secret

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,719
what if anniversary links partial

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
information from every share

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,840
for example it leaks one bit

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
bi from every share style

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
is a secret still hidden given the

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,280
leakage

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,399
in other words

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
it's a zone distributions

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
of the leakages b1 b2 to bn

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,159
uncreated

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
with the secret s

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
so

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
uh a secret sharing scheme is liquid

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
resilience

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,040
if the secret

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,240
remains hidden

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,320
so

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
why are we interested in legit brazilian

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
secret sharing

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
in fact liquid brazilian situations

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,159
is a very useful spirited

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
it has connection to many other fields

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
for example it is related to the

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
fascinating problem of repairing

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
anarchodic gods

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
in this problem the main objectives is

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
to learn minimum information from each

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,119
chair

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
so that the secret can be fully

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
reconstructed using

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,799
the given information

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,439
implicitly if you are able to

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
fully reconstruct the secret

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,840
then the secret saying scheme is not

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
make it

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,318
resilient on the other hand

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
my basically thoughts you can't totally

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
construct the secret

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
but

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
the secret scheme is still not really

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,760
resilient

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
if the leakages review some information

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
about the secret test

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
lipid residual secretions

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,440
has been used at building blocks for

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
secure multi-party computation protocols

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
that are resilient to

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
local liquid attacks

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
it also

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
means ill as building blocks for other

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,640
primitives for example

66
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,679
non-level secret shape

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
since the introductions there have been

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
two prominent research directions on

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
league brazilian secretary

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,519
the first connection is to construct

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,800
new secrets and experience

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,640
[Music]

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,959
so there have been a lot of fascinating

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
work that focused on constructing

75
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,319
new chicago schemes

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
that is resilience to very

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
sophisticated

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,040
liquid attacks

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
however these constructions usually

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,599
incur significant overheads

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,280
and it can lose

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
the algebraic structure

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
for example it can lose the linearity

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
structure

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,360
and sometimes

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
the linearity is very important in

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
applications

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,239
that's why there is another lab work

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,680
that studies

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
the liquid residues a prominent secret

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
sense games

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
like the additive secretion schemes or

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,079
the xiaomi year shift design scheme

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,599
and

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
this have no significant impact on the

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,799
real world implementations

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
our works belong to this lack of

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
research

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
and now next let me introduce the

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,840
context of our work before discussing

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
the main results

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
we study liquid residence of chemistry

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,880
scheme

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
so how does summation

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
setting skin work

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
for a given secret test

107
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
it picks a random polynomial of degree

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
at most k minus 1

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,639
so that the evolution place

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,000
at 0 equal to x and you can see in the

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
picture here

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
and the shares are evolutions

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
of the preliminar and n distinct

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,120
places x1 and 2 xn

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
and you need uh early stages to

116
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
reconstruct the secret and any less than

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
glaciers

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,758
gives no information about the secrets

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
and in our work we consider chemistry

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
questioning skin with random evaluation

121
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
places

122
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
what i mean is that x1 and 2

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
xn are chosen uniformly at random

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
for the liquid model

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,880
we consider physical bit leakage

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,600
so all the shares are stored in their

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
binary representations

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
for example

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,840
if the

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
prime field of size 31

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,320
and if the status is 6 and we will store

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,960
0 0 1 1 0

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,160
and if a share is 19

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,320
then we store 1 0 0 1 1.

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
the liquid function may learn the

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
physical bits

137
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
of the set for example the least sigma

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
leakage of 19 is one

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,520
so with this uh in mind let me

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
discuss our main results so the first

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
result is visibility results

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
let lambda be the security parameter

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
um

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
let assume that every single stress is

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
an element from a prime field f

146
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
where the size of your f is

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
roughly to develop lambda

148
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
let n be the number of bodies and that

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,240
case is a reconstruction tester and we

150
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,199
assume that embeds are leaked from heavy

151
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
checks

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
so our results

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,759
say that with overwhelming probability

154
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
the premium secret

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
is a local league resilience as long as

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
the total amount of leakage in less than

157
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
the entropies introduced by

158
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
the skin

159
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
here's the total amount of leakage in m

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
times n

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
because the n vertices and each of them

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
links m bit from the checks

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
and the total n should be

164
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
a k times number

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,039
since

166
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,080
uh each share has nana bits

167
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
and we need exactly

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,120
k chess to reconstruct the secret

169
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
and here we know that the problematic is

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,639
taken over the random choices of

171
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
evaluation places

172
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
so it means that most of are for most of

173
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,759
evolution places the corresponding

174
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,479
xiaomi series schemes is a legit

175
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,000
brazilian

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,199
however

177
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
for some evaluation places

178
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
it did not make it resilient

179
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
so our result hope for any

180
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
reconstruction that's okay that is

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,360
greater than or equal to two

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
and here i want to emphasis that all the

183
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,479
previous results uh requires the

184
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,280
reconstruction threshold to be large

185
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
okay

186
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,759
so our result enables negative

187
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
resilience of secure multibatch

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
computations

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
using

190
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,000
gmw stack

191
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
so to complement

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,360
the first

193
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
of the first result we propose a new

194
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,879
physical liquid attacks

195
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
okay so we show that

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
um when the evaluation places are chosen

197
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
badly

198
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
the secret uh because xiaomi secretary

199
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
scheme is not

200
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,799
resilient

201
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
from

202
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
us

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
small reconstruction vessel

204
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
so we

205
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
name our attacks

206
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
as parity of party attacks

207
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
it looks the receiving bit of each share

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
and then it computes

209
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
with b

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,480
as a priority also x all of all the

211
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
leaked bits

212
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
and this is a prediction

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
uh

214
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
for the secret

215
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
and we show that

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,519
um the advantage below about it by the

217
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,040
frequencies of the agreed whole

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
distributions and p tends to infinity

219
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,680
and we also proved that um the advantage

220
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
be constant

221
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
if the reconstruction test so

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
is small

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
uh you know full of work uh rms all

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,399
prove that so advantage

225
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
is

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
at least one by k factorial for any

227
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
reconstruction test of day

228
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
also in an ongoing work we show that

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,880
in fact it is exponentially small in k

230
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,360
and this is asymptotically optimal when

231
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
the number of practice is equal to the

232
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
reconstruction threshold because it

233
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,240
matches with the upper bound

234
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
in the bdir paper

235
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
it also would mention that in the bdi

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
paper

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
they put that one mainly

238
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
one bit general leakage

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
to get an advantage of pay to support

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
minus k

241
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
here

242
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,040
it requires that the liquid functions in

243
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
general in not a physical bit

244
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
and next

245
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
let me position our visibility resort

246
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,440
with the clownies related work

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
so bdi shows that the semester sharing

248
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,760
with any evolution places

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
is ambi liquid resilience as long as

250
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
the reconstruction tesla is large enough

251
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,680
okay and when amiku took one um the cons

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,480
as a parameter delta m equal to 0.85

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,360
and

254
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
it is liquid resonance again general

255
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
leakage

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,399
in another work um

257
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,120
they show that some massive exchange

258
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
scheme corresponding to a random mini

259
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
codes

260
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
is

261
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,880
liquid resilience as long as the

262
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
reconstruction threshold is at least

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
half the number of particles

264
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,800
and this also again the liquid functions

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
but here

266
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,079
the constructions you're running my

267
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
constructions

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,040
okay it is

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
different from the bdir results

270
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,320
but bdi is a deterministic construction

271
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
for our work we also

272
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,959
have a randomized constructions

273
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,040
but it is for the xiaomi secretary spain

274
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
and we consider more restricted

275
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
liquid family

276
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
but we can show that

277
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
it is liquid resilience for any k that

278
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
is greater than equal to 2 and it

279
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,079
require

280
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
and the number but is only pulley in

281
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
the security parameters

282
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
and for the rest of the talk

283
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
um i will discuss

284
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
the clinical ideas for our paper

285
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
first area

286
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
and we talk about um semantics

287
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
the main technical idea for the

288
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
feasibility results

289
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,680
here is um let me recall the

290
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
the feasibility results

291
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
we say that if the total

292
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
i will prove that if the total amount of

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
leakage is less than the entropy

294
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,680
and

295
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,320
then the xiaomi sequencing scheme is a

296
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
linked resilience with very high

297
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
probability

298
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
so to prove this we do the following

299
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,600
reductions

300
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
first we suppose that

301
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
we can prove that for any negative

302
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
functions for any two secrets

303
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
the advantage is small over randomly

304
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
chosen evaluation places

305
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,120
and with these assumptions um by an only

306
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,839
uh by a union valve on the liquid

307
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,440
functions we can show that most

308
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
evolution places

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
give local liquid brazilian sugar saying

310
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,639
skin

311
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
so the second step here is

312
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
quite simple

313
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
so

314
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
for the rest uh we'll be focusing on the

315
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
first item here

316
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
we're going to up about

317
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
the distinguished advantage

318
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
and here's an overview of how to

319
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,399
bounding

320
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
how to bound

321
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
this advantage

322
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
so we follow the standard fourier

323
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
analysis approach as in the pdi paper

324
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,680
however we encounter some bottlenecks

325
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,880
to overcome these bottlenecks we utilize

326
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,639
the randomness of

327
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
evaluation places

328
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
so that we can reduce the problem to

329
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
have two problems

330
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
the problem is we need a tie estimations

331
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,959
of an exponential sum

332
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
and versus problem b

333
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,079
we need the upper bound on the number of

334
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
solutions of a system of equations

335
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
well i really discussed in more details

336
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,800
about these two problems is the next

337
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
slide

338
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
so for the first problem

339
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,839
suppose a liquid function is a

340
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
mystery it's a little significant

341
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
linkage

342
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,680
and suppose that the observation is zero

343
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,839
then so we need sets

344
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,720
with the standard even number from zero

345
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
to b minus one

346
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,720
why because uh this number

347
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
and the least significant bit of this

348
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,240
number is zero

349
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,120
so we are interested in upper bounding

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,199
this sum

351
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
so intuitively this is the a1

352
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
fourier norm

353
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,920
of the indica of the indicator function

354
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,719
of the set x

355
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,199
so our key observations is that a green

356
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,040
set

357
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,920
can be represented as a rejoined union

358
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
of a small number of bank two

359
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,000
proper generalized arithmetic

360
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
progressions

361
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
and here i want to

362
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
emphasis that

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,959
this is true for any

364
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,279
physical liquid function not only is the

365
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,639
miscibility

366
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
that we mentioned here

367
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
so for example

368
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,399
um

369
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,160
process set 8 9 12 and 13

370
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
they see a right to

371
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
generalize arithmetic progressions

372
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
and it is the witnesses for the second

373
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
legislative bits

374
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,040
fix it to zero

375
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,519
when the

376
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
the side of the

377
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
field is 29

378
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
so with the these key uh observations it

379
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
suffices to building the a1 through a

380
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
norm of

381
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
um 2

382
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
generalized artifact progressions

383
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
and we saw that uh

384
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,600
the a1 norm has the a14 norm

385
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,079
of the rank 2 graph divided by this

386
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
quantity

387
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,360
and for the second problems we need

388
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,639
about on this

389
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,880
uh the number of solution of a system of

390
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
equations

391
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
so we fix some alpha

392
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
we fix some vector alpha

393
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
and we consider the following system of

394
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
equations that's the product of this

395
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
matrix with this vector alpha equal to

396
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,199
vector 0

397
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,359
and we are interested in how many

398
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
solution x

399
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
for this equations

400
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
so intuitively

401
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,039
we fix some vector alpha

402
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
and we are interested in counting how

403
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
many dual chords

404
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
that are

405
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
the door of the court center dated as

406
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
generated by this matrix

407
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,000
contains the vector alpha

408
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
so

409
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,919
um to bounce the number of the solutions

410
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,640
we employ a special variance of the

411
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,320
results theorem over a finite field

412
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
and we prove that the number of

413
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,320
solutions e and most k factorial

414
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
one interesting things to observe is

415
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
that it's a solution

416
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,200
then

417
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,799
it's easy to say that

418
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
easy to see that there are at least

419
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
three factorial solutions

420
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,440
why

421
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
because any permutation of these

422
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,080
solutions also

423
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
a solution

424
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,559
so we also and our result also up about

425
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,679
this by

426
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
k factorial

427
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,240
so by solving these two problems

428
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
we can prove our feasibility results

429
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,000
okay for the rest of this talk i will be

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
discussing the technical ideas for our

431
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
attack

432
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
so recall that our main objective is to

433
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,080
show that the semi-secrecy as a

434
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,840
semi-secret sharing scheme is not liquid

435
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,640
resilience when the information places

436
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,559
are chosen back

437
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
for small value of

438
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,200
where there is a reconstruction platform

439
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,440
so we consider a xiaomi sequencing

440
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
stream

441
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
with the number of parties equal to the

442
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,120
reconstruction vessel

443
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
over a prime field f

444
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
and we suppose that the site surface is

445
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,120
equal to one modular gate

446
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
so uh we let alpha alpha square and

447
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
alpha k

448
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
to be

449
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,799
also k primitive growth

450
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
of the infinity in other words it is the

451
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
solutions of the of these equations

452
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,240
and we consider

453
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
very distinct evaluation places x1 equal

454
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,160
to alpha actually equal half a square

455
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,360
and square equal to alpha g but k

456
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
we will show that

457
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
each information places at the back uh

458
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
average evaluation place

459
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,039
so

460
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,559
first observe that

461
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
the sum of the operations

462
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,840
as x1 and 2 to xj equal to case time s

463
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,918
for any polynomial p

464
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
and the negative functions makes the

465
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,159
listing bits of such as s1 s2 to sk

466
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
we show that the parity of parity

467
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
attacks predicts the least frequent bits

468
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
of the

469
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
ks

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
with constant advantage

471
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
for some particular secret test

472
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
why

473
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,799
we can observe that

474
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
the advantage is zero

475
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,760
on statistically close to zero

476
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,799
for a random secret gas

477
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,159
so by an averaging argument

478
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,480
we can show that severity of priorities

479
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,600
attacks distinguishes two secrets with a

480
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,959
constant advantage

481
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,640
and and here's

482
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
some more details for the advantage

483
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
we put that it is a constant for any k

484
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
equal to two or three

485
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
and we also show that it is constant for

486
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,159
small value of k

487
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,360
by experiment

488
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
the function is advantage is lower

489
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
bounded by the discrepancy of the

490
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
agreement whole distributions as

491
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,440
p

492
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
tends to infinity

493
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
and

494
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,919
note that the discrepancy of the hybrid

495
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
whole distributions be at least one by k

496
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,679
factorable at one by k factorial if not

497
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,840
equal to

498
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
zero and also from the experimental

499
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,400
results we concentrate that the

500
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
advantage exponentially small intake

501
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,600
and as mentioned earlier

502
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,399
this is proven by a subsequent work

503
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,360
and

504
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
lastly i want to

505
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,600
remember our text naturally extend to

506
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,320
evaluation places that form a code set

507
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
of

508
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
alpha alpha square

509
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,240
alpha k

510
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
and

511
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,320
when the number of parties is strictly

512
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
greater than the reconstruction

513
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
threshold

514
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
one can choose the remainder of

515
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,880
evolution places arbitrarily

516
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
and we can still get the same

517
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
advantage

518
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
using the same analysis

519
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
okay now this concludes my fault uh

520
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
thank you for listening um

521
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,120
if you are interested in uh more details

522
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
you can take a look at the full version

523
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
is available at

524
