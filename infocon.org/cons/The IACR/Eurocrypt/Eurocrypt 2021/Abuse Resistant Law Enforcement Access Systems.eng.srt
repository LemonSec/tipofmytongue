1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
hello and welcome to this video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,920
uh that is recorded for eurocrypt 2021

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,600
my name is yasmanlai i'm with johns

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,679
hopkins university i will be talking

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,679
about abuse resistant law enforcement

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,599
access systems this is joint work with

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
matt green also from hopkins and gabe

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,840
capchuk at boston university

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,439
so what are abuse resistant law

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
enforcement access systems

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,519
so these systems allow law enforcement

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
to legally access end-to-end encrypted

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
systems and especially with the rise of

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,640
end-to-end encrypted systems this is

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
something law enforcement badly wants

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
this is also known as backdoors and have

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
been a very hot topic in recent years

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,559
and even longer before that

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,480
so what we're trying to achieve is

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
giving law enforcement the ability to do

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,480
legal searches

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
but obviously there is a risk of being

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
overly invasive and

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
the risk of mass surveillance and this

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
is something that we want to avoid and

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
build into the system

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
so what is this discussion on the one

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
hand we have law enforcement and policy

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
makers

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,319
who want uh backdoors in in encrypted

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,920
systems but on the other hand we have

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
privacy activists and cryptographic

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
experts

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
so law enforcement claims that

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,600
end-to-end encrypted systems limit their

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
ability to do constitutional searches

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
but privacy activists say that

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,880
encryption became a fundamental part of

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
doing business and also for privacy of

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
the general population

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,880
they also say that backdoors are gonna

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,360
be vulnerable to abuse and theft but

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
then law enforcement say that there are

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
smart enough people in tech that can

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
invent a secure backdoor

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
and they suggest some form of key escrow

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
where there is some type of master key

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
that can access

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
encrypted ciphertext that is either

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
holds by the service provider or

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
somewhere on a device or something like

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,320
that

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,240
but then again cryptographic experts say

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
that it's going to be very hard to

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
detect when failure happens with kia

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
scroll i mean with failure we mean

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
the abuse of the key so

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
either for mass surveillance or even

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,759
when the key is leaked that this is used

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
by a malicious actor

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
so as you note there is a lot of

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
rhetoric on this topic but there is

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,400
actually very little dialogue and

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
moreover there are no specifications for

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,720
what such systems should look like and

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
this is something that we like to

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
address in this paper

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
looking at the history of backdoors we

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
can go back all the way to the beginning

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
of the 90s during the first crypto wars

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,879
at that time the nsa had a ship called

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
the clipper chip that was meant to

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,519
encrypt phone conversations but also

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
gave them access to these conversations

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
a lot of vulnerabilities were found with

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
this ship and it was discontinued

77
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,480
when edward snowden leaked the

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
classified documents

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
from the nsa it was only then that the

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
general public became more aware of this

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,279
issue and

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,319
start caring about it

83
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,000
in 2015 the fbi asked apple to access an

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,959
iphone

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,200
from the san bernardino shooter but

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
apple refused leading to a court case

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
fbi later dropped the case when a third

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
party actually helped them access the

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,640
device

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,519
in 2020 the ernia ernitz act was

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,280
proposed

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
in this law

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
it actually uh required companies to

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,840
build a backdoor into end-to-end

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
encrypted systems

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
this is a u.s

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
u.s law proposal but in a lot of other

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
countries such laws were also proposed

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
making this a real um a real threat on

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
end-to-end encrypted systems

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
there is also during the senate hearing

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
in december 2019 a republican senator

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
from iowa said i think you'd rather find

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
a solution than have congress do it for

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
you and unfortunately he's right

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,720
so in this paper we try to

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
approach this problem from a technical

108
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
side and show uh how to achieve some

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
form of this and why this is so

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
difficult

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
so the key escrow idea that law

112
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
enforcement

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
people propose and that some

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
cryptographic experts actually

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
investigated or re did some research on

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,639
is some form of

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
of this scheme where law enforcement

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,358
asks a judge or judiciary to get a

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
warrant

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,720
once they have a warrant they can

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,759
get some form of backdoor key with which

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
they can decrypt communication between

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
users or an encrypted device and so this

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
key comes can come from either a

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
physical device so meaning that

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
the that law enforcement actually have

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
to

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
possess the device before they can use

129
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
the key

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
um

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
or it can be provided by the service

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
provider

133
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
who can then check if the warrant is

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,880
actually valid

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,360
as mentioned before this is very

136
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
vulnerable to

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
theft of key or abuse of the key

138
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
so what properties do we want in an

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,320
abuse resistant law enforcement access

140
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
system

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
so first of all we want the warrants to

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
adhere to some to certain properties

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
which we call global warrant policies

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
um we want messages to be secure as long

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
as there is no warrant for these

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
messages

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
for decrypting these messages

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
we want some form of transparency and

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,639
abuse detectability

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
and we want all these properties to

151
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
cryptographically

152
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
to be cryptographically tied to the

153
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
encryption

154
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
so a few examples a few examples of this

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
for example global warrant policies

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
could include that warren should list

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,160
individuals instead of uh general groups

158
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
or anything like that

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
uh to make sure that any warrants are

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,199
not overly broad

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
also if any warrants

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,319
contain any sensitive subjects

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
we can require to have additional

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
oversight before the warrant can be used

165
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,039
when talking about transparency and

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
abuse deductibility the very least you

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
can think of in this setting is

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
the number of wires that are activated

169
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
so that

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,319
one can verify that the warrants are

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
actually not

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
or the backdoor is actually not used on

173
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
a massive scale

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,919
but also more

175
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,639
more advanced things can

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
can be added to this transparency for

177
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
example any differentially private

178
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
statistics

179
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
making sure that no minority groups are

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
targeted or anything like that

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
and then the cryptographic enforcement

182
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,240
as i said we want both these global

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
ovarian policies as well as this abuse

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
detectability to be cryptographically

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
tied to the back door

186
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
so some recent research has been done on

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
accountability in uh in backdoors uh

188
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
but nothing uh as full a definition as

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,960
ours

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
so for example frankl at all um

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
also used public ledgers is something

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,479
that we are going to use as well we'll

193
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,720
get back to that um for that

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,639
accountability but this was not

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
specifically for end-to-end encrypted

196
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
also pen where it all did something

197
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
something similar but it was never tied

198
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
to the encryption

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,160
uh wright and varya that uh introduced

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
this idea of crypto doing cryptographic

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,759
there's also to increase the cost for

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,479
law enforcement so that they can not do

203
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
uh mass surveillance but you could argue

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
that especially the nsa has enough

205
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
researchers to actually still do mass

206
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
surveillance and still solve these

207
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,560
cryptographic puzzles and moreover they

208
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
probably don't want

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
um cryptographic puzzles to actually

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
access

211
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
encrypted

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,520
encrypted messages

213
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
then scafuro in 2019 had a very closely

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,960
related concept to ours but this was

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
based on trusted hardware instead of

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,679
public ledgers

217
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,520
so what parties are we talking about in

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
our in our system so we have the

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
judiciary

220
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,599
for simplicity we call this one judge

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
but this can be easily

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,120
extended to

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
multiple judges

224
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
we have law enforcement that basically

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,479
wants to access the encrypted messages

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
and we have the user that actually uses

227
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,120
the service to send end-to-end encrypted

228
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
messages

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
but we have this one extra thing that i

230
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
already talked about is the the public

231
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
ledger you can think of this as a

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,520
bulletin board

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
um

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
this uh this is a well-studied concept

235
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
and a lot of research has been done

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
about this

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
you can think of this as a blockchain

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,799
but doesn't necessarily have to be um

239
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
the important properties that we require

240
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
from this are the fact that it doesn't

241
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
have any escrow secrets

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
um meaning that we're not moving this

243
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
idea of kia escrow just to the ledger

244
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
the ledger needs to be publicly

245
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
accessible meaning everyone should be

246
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,839
able to read whatever is on the public

247
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
ledger

248
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
you can restrict this a little bit

249
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
for example to

250
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
allow only

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
independent third parties to read the

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
public ledger

253
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
and very importantly the

254
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
when you post something on the ledger

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
you need to get a proof of publication

256
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
and that proof of publication needs to

257
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
be able you need to be able to verify

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
that offline

259
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
and now even when law enforcement and

260
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
the judges together collude

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,399
uh we still want some transparency uh to

262
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,040
be guaranteed due to the fact that the

263
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
public ledger is trusted

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,920
so what is the earliest paradigm so two

265
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
users are using an end-to-end encrypted

266
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,360
communication system

267
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
but instead of just having one

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
ciphertext they basically add a second

269
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
ciphertext that will be used

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
by law enforcement to access the message

271
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
and we add a proof

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
that both ciphertext actually contain

273
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
the same message

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
this is a non-interactive zero-knowledge

275
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
proof

276
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
so now law enforcement wants to access

277
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
these encrypted messages and asks the

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
judge for a warrant

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
if that is allowed they get that warrant

280
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
they can put this through what we call a

281
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,200
transparency function that distills some

282
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
information out of this warrant that can

283
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
later be published so that information

284
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
gets published on the bulletin board

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
and once that is published uh law

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
enforcement gets a proof of publication

287
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
back and this basically together with

288
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,760
the warrants becomes a key to then

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
access the encrypted message

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
so this is very important the key

291
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
contains the warrants the transparency

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
information as well as the proof of

293
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
publication

294
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
and only if all these things are valid

295
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,240
and the warrant is actually adhering to

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
the global warrant policies they can

297
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,600
access the information

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
so what concepts do we use we're as i

299
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
said gonna use proof of publication

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,279
ledgers

301
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,959
um

302
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
we're gonna have non-interactive secure

303
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
computation uh this is an idea where a

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
receiver can post an encryption of

305
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
whatever their input is

306
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
and a sender can then use just one

307
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
message

308
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
so that

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,040
they can send f x1 x2 to the receiver

310
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,880
where x2 is the sender's input

311
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
this can be instantiated using garbled

312
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
circuits and this posted encryption will

313
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
be a partial oblivious transfer

314
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,600
basically

315
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
we're also needing non-interactive

316
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
launch proofs we need them to be

317
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
simulation extractable

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
and then finally we're gonna need the

319
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
very strong notion of extractable

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
witness encryption where basically

321
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
encryption happens using a statement in

322
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
an mp language and only you can only

323
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
decrypt when you have a witness for that

324
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
statement

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
and the extractability property

326
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
basically says that if there is an

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,279
adversary that can decrypt then there

328
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
exists an extractor that can actually

329
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,680
extract a witness from the statements

330
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
for the statements from the adversary

331
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
it is a very strong notion and there are

332
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
actually some implausibility results for

333
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,079
general languages there exists some

334
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,680
witness encryption for very simple

335
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
languages

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
but

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
nevertheless it's a very strong notion

338
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,420
we're gonna also

339
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,440
[Music]

340
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
show why we need such strong notion

341
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
so before we go into the implementation

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,920
details i have a few important things to

343
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
note here so first of all we're looking

344
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,279
at inc

345
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,399
to

346
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,680
data in motion and not just data at rest

347
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
and we're splitting this up into two

348
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
different cases basically what we call

349
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
prospective artist and retrospective

350
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
artists

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
so

352
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
imagine at some point law enforcement

353
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
gets a warrant and

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,720
activates it to actually be used at some

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
point in time then the prospective

356
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
artist will be able to decrypt all

357
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
messages that are created after the

358
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,200
warrants activation so all messages that

359
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
are in scope of this specific words

360
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
while in the retrospective case we'll

361
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,000
also be we will also be able to decrypt

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,839
messages that were already encrypted

363
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
before that warrant existed

364
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
so how did we build prospective rds so

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
remember the users didn't send any

366
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,320
communication yet they might have but at

367
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,240
least law enforcement cannot access that

368
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,839
previous communication

369
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
law enforcement gets a warrant the

370
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,079
warrant goes through the transparency

371
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,120
function

372
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
and

373
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
the transparency information

374
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
gets posted on the board

375
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
on the public uh bulletin board

376
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,920
um but together with this transparency

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
information they also

378
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,800
uh post

379
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
uh the first round messages for

380
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
oblivious transfer that encodes the

381
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,079
warrants

382
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,880
um

383
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,639
this is for the non-interactive secure

384
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
computation

385
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,519
now

386
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,160
the users at that second ciphertext

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
which basically becomes a garbled

388
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
circuit that only outputs the message if

389
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
the warrant is applicable and was indeed

390
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,800
posted on the bulletin board

391
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
and then they add a simulation

392
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
extractable music

393
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
and so basically this

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
the information that was on the bulletin

395
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
board becomes a key to actually access

396
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,239
the message

397
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,440
so basically we're building prospective

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
earliest

399
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
using this non-interactive two-party

400
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,680
computation and simulation extractable

401
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
physics

402
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,199
as well as this public bulletin board

403
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,519
and we show that it is realizable in the

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,079
universal composability framework from

405
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,638
canadi

406
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
so if we then look at the retrospective

407
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,399
rds so importantly here the

408
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
communication already happens between

409
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,680
the users before

410
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
law enforcement actually gets the

411
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
warrant so the second cipher text is

412
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
actually an extractable witness

413
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
encryption

414
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,000
ciphertext and it only decrypts the

415
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
message

416
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
when there is a correct warrant and a

417
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
proof of publication of the transparency

418
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
information of the words

419
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,519
so basically this becomes a witness to

420
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
the mp language that we're using to

421
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,040
encrypt the message

422
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
and again there is a simulation

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
extractable music to make sure that both

424
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,959
ciphertexts contain the same message

425
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
so now going quickly over this but law

426
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
enforcement gets a warrant

427
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,519
puts it again through the transparency

428
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,920
function publishes the information

429
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
on the bulletin boards which only

430
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
contains the transparency information

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
and

432
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
the proof of publication together with

433
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
the warrant will basically become a key

434
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
to decrypt the extractable witness

435
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,079
encryption

436
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,800
ciphertext

437
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,000
so we built retrospective various from

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
extractable witness encryption and

439
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,519
simulation extractable music and we show

440
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
again that it's secure in the universal

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
composability framework from canada

442
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
kennedy

443
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
and our final results basically says

444
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,759
that this extractable witness encryption

445
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
is actually needed to build respective

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
artists uh so we show that it also

447
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
implies extractable witness encryption

448
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,560
for a non-trivial language so

449
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
to be clear this is not for general

450
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,759
languages

451
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
but at least for a very non-trivial

452
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,320
language

453
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,199
so in conclusion uh we're getting uh

454
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,120
the fact that getting abuse resistance

455
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,320
is actually a very hard problem uh data

456
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
in motion is also more difficult than

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,079
data addressed

458
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,040
we show

459
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
the difference between a prospective and

460
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
a retrospective case and that

461
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
prospective can maybe be achieved but

462
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,040
still needs quite some uh inefficient

463
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,560
crypto uh but for retrospective uh you

464
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
even need crypto that might even be

465
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
implausible

466
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
um

467
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
then we've shown the prospective or

468
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
we've built the perspective in the

469
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
retrospective case and both showed them

470
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
secure in the universal composability

471
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
framework

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
and then we showed that at least some

473
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,160
form of extractable witness encryption

474
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,959
is needed to achieve retrospective ideas

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
