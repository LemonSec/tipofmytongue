1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,800
so hello everyone

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
uh

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,040
the title of this work is improved

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,760
linear approximations to our ciphers in

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
attacks against cha-cha

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,120
uh

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
joint work uh

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,560
of myself

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
murillo coaching and uh sosanato

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
we are both researchers

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720
at the research and development center

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
for communication security

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,279
in brazil

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,159
so let's start talking about uh the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,239
string cipher cha-cha

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,360
um

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,160
the cipher was proposed by bernstein

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,079
2008 as an improvement of the string

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
cypher salsa which was one of the

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,399
winners of the stay stream competition

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
chacha consists of a series of arcs

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
operations additional rotation and xor

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,440
on 30 32 bit words and it is highly

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
efficient both in softer and in harder

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
and as everyone knows

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
churches heavily use it it's one of the

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
cypher suits in the tls for example use

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
it on on chrome android um and protocols

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
such as ssh noise

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
and vpn applications such as wire guard

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,439
and actually also the pure energy

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
and linux kernel

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,759
newer linux kernel

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,520
so

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
of course as

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,159
charge is very important and then it's

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
it's also important to to understand

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
very well its security

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,920
and these are the the the main uh

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
results of cryptanalysis of the

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,520
reductions

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
of south of chacha and

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
as you can see here

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
uh this work improves

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
the the tracks for six rounds and uh

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,439
seven rounds of course in the case of

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
the attack for seven rounds

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
we have a trade-off on time and memory

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
but

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,520
it's also the first work in which we can

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
and we developed some linear

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,120
approximations which

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
can get up to the the seven heart

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
cha-cha as i said is on our side for

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,760
and uh it's based on

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
a function which is called the

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
quarter hunt function which receives

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,440
four integers and

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
update these integers as this operations

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,480
on the left side here and these

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
operations can be represented as the

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
circuit

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,840
on the right side

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,120
also charge is organized as a

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,319
matrix is this the state of the the

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
cipher

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
on a four by four matrix matrix

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,159
and uh

69
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
each element of this matrix is an

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,440
integer of a 32 32 bit

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
uh long

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
integer and the quaran function is then

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
applied first on the columns

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
on other rounds and in even rounds on

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
the diagonals

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
respecting the colors that i

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,840
plotted here in this

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,239
slide the initial state of structure and

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,920
it's very simple you initialize with

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
some constants uh

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
the two

82
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
256

83
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,440
bit key

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
and uh announce and a counter

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
okay after talking about cha cha it's

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,080
time to talk a little bit about uh

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
definition linear crypto analysis of

88
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,519
course uh differential cryptanalysis and

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,560
linux

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
are the most important

91
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,159
tools

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
for cryptanalysis

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
since the 90s with the work of shamir

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
behind matsui

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
and

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
and so on so

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
uh it's possible to combine

98
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
both of these techniques and then

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
you divide your cipher into parts which

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
you will call e1 and e choose two sub

101
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
ciphers covering m and l rounds of the

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,639
main cipher so you

103
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,880
apply an input different ratio

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
on the subcipher e1

105
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,919
then you have a transition probability

106
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
to another differentiation after

107
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
uh those m rounds and then you apply

108
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,080
apply a linear mask

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,759
m to gamma out which occurs with

110
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
probability

111
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
q

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
sometimes

113
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
you cannot actually divide the cipher in

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
three parts as was done in the work of

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
barely in crypto 2020 when attacking

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,960
cha-cha

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
and yeah this

118
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
is the

119
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
to

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
the basic review

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
okay so now

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,039
we are going to to

123
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,120
to talk a little bit about the line

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,479
approximations to our ciphers and more

125
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,280
specifically to the string cipher

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,639
cha-cha

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,080
so in previous work um

128
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
in 2016 should the hurry and matrix

129
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
develop a theory for selecting specific

130
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,800
combinations of bits to give a higher

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,440
coherence for cha-cha and they did that

132
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,400
by expro exploring the mathematical

133
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
structure of the algorithm

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,759
and of course as expected the difficult

135
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,600
part is to deal with the addition

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
operation which is the non-linear

137
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,080
operation for arcs algorithms

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,600
first let us define right now that the

139
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
function theta of an x and y

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
is the carry function of the sum x plus

141
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
y

142
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
so we defined that

143
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
theta subscript i

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
as the f bit of theta x and y

145
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,720
so by definition remember that theta 0

146
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
is equal to zero

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
and then

148
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,880
in

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
that work in 2016

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
should here in matrix show that we can

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,919
write the quarter hund functions

152
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
equations of cha-cha

153
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
as these expressions and more

154
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,280
importantly that these equations can be

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
inverted

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,759
so you can represent any bit of the

157
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
state of cha-cha

158
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
uh in a round m minus one

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,400
as a combinations a combination of bits

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,520
in

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,840
one round

162
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,599
after

163
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
so

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,919
here you you can notice that we have a

165
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,280
linear part

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
xor a non-linear part which is

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
represented as a combination of bits

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
of carry bits and the function theta

169
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and these are the linear expressions

170
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
that we get for cha-cha

171
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
and

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,720
the important thing here is that using

173
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
properties of theta is possible to

174
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,639
obtain linear approximations

175
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
for the quadrant function

176
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
and in previous works after use the

177
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
following result in which we you can

178
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,319
approximate that um theta in position i

179
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,400
has the bit y in position i minus one if

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
correlation i have

181
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
for example

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,759
uh take the bit

183
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,560
i

184
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
of the word b

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
and when applying applied in the

186
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,400
quadrant function as we saw in the

187
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
previous slide we have this expression

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
and then we have here a linear

189
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
approximation

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,479
to the speed with a correlation a half

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
so

192
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
in previous works of crit analysis of

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
ciphers

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
outers concentrated and find these

195
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,640
linear approximations

196
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,839
by using these equations for one hand

197
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,559
and repeating repeating

198
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
these equations uh for each hound

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,680
that you desire to expand

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,720
however

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,480
uh we showed in this work that we can

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
actually create a strategy to improve

203
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
linear approximations when considering

204
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
more rounds by combining the following

205
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
linear approximations for theta

206
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
the first one is the the one that you

207
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
you we saw previously

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,680
and the second one is new and

209
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
you can see that we have two adjacent

210
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,399
beats

211
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
of the of the carry

212
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,839
and

213
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,800
they cancel out to zero with coherential

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
so for example again consider the bti of

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
the word be as as we did

216
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
some moments ago

217
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,720
then we're trying to find suppose that

218
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
we try to find an approximation

219
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
to to this linear combination of two

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
adjacent bits of the word b

221
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,360
so in previous works we we would use the

222
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,160
the the the expansion that we are

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
showing above here

224
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,440
two times one for this bit and one for

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,680
uh the second bit

226
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
and then we would get this linear

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,839
expression

228
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,040
below

229
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
with correlation

230
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
a quarter

231
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,760
instead we could use the approximation

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
that cancel out the non-linear terms

233
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
in this case

234
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
is easy to see that

235
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
the expansion would be

236
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
this one so

237
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
of course you can cancel out these these

238
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,000
two terms and this leads to to this

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,310
linear expression that is not only

240
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,760
[Music]

241
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
does not only have fewer terms it's a

242
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
good thing when you are trying to expand

243
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
further but also has a higher

244
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
correlation of a half

245
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
so why this is useful against i are

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
cipher

247
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
ciphers because it is possible to reduce

248
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
the complexity in several cases

249
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
for example a very simple example right

250
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
here consider the sum z

251
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
equals 2x plus y

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
if we want a linear approximation to the

253
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
beat the seventh bit of z then we can

254
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
use the first approximation of the

255
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
required function to to obtain

256
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
by definition

257
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,480
this expression so this is this is by

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
definition for the sum of course then

259
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
with the first

260
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
linear approximation to the curry beach

261
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
you get

262
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
this expression in which you can see

263
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
that

264
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
you have two adjacent bits here um

265
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,120
as a given so every time that you use

266
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
the first expression you get the second

267
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,399
one from first three three so

268
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
in the second round it would be

269
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
uh way better to expand

270
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
expanding the the the equation using uh

271
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
that expression instead of individually

272
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,160
expanding with the the the the linear

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
approximation for one round

274
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,320
uh

275
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
and this works because since the xor

276
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,519
operation will not change the indexes

277
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,800
and the rotation we probably keep these

278
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,079
these two bits adjacent then yeah we can

279
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,720
use the second approximation to to

280
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
cancel out the nonlinear terms

281
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
and applying this idea

282
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
we derived and proved more than 15 new

283
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
linear operations for one round of

284
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,279
cha-cha

285
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,320
for example for multiple active input

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
bits

287
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,120
in route and -1 and multiple active

288
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
output bits in rod m the following

289
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
linear approximations hold for charger

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
with probe with correlation one over two

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
to the power of k

292
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,120
so here we see three three examples in

293
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
the chat we have combinations of bits in

294
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
a round

295
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
so

296
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
even combinations of three bits with a

297
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
very high

298
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
correlation which is which is very good

299
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
so using

300
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,160
these results that we proved

301
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
in our work we we tried to improve our

302
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,360
own previous work in 2020

303
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
and deriving the following in which we

304
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
derived the following linear

305
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,839
approximation

306
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
so in that work in 2020

307
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
uh we showed that this expansion for six

308
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,800
rounds leads to a correlation of 2 to

309
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
the power of minus 13.

310
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
however we can do better with the

311
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
proposed technique

312
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,320
and in fact we present here the first

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,240
explicitly arrived approximation range

314
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,279
in three complete rounds of cha-cha and

315
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
with correlation two to the power of

316
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,399
minus eight

317
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
so this is the extraction it's a very

318
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,360
beautiful expression as you can see

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,399
and this was proven in our paper the

320
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
proof is there for anyone who is

321
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,839
interesting to to understand

322
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
and also

323
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,519
we verify these results computationally

324
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,560
so

325
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
um

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
now the challenge of course uh we had

327
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,720
approximation up to six rounds and in

328
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
the the challenge is to try to find a

329
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
distinction for seven rounds because in

330
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,680
2016 should we mitre

331
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,399
remarked that x and expansion

332
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
for this battery due to seven rounds

333
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
would be very unlikely to be useful

334
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,639
indeed applying this this their

335
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
technique as they presented in their

336
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,839
work

337
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
aggregated correlation for seven rounds

338
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,920
would be two to the power of minus 109

339
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
thus using this linear expression of

340
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
course

341
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,399
in a different

342
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
differential linear attack would be

343
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,279
deter

344
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
a distinguishing complexity

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
very high

346
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,880
no less than g to the power of

347
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,079
436 which is

348
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
of course useless

349
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,040
however using our linear approximations

350
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
you can get a much better result

351
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
and in fact we proved in our prepare in

352
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
our paper that the following linear

353
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
approximation holds with correlation 1

354
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,560
over

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
2 to the power of

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,760
55

357
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
and again it's a very

358
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,639
beautiful expression um

359
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,800
it's hard to prove

360
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
but

361
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
we did it and also

362
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
verified the results computationally

363
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,079
by

364
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
segregating independent parts completing

365
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
the correlation

366
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
and using the pilot apparently pandemia

367
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
to to get the final result

368
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000
and so yeah using a differential

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
correlation of our previous work

370
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,920
in 2020

371
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,599
we can

372
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
create new distinguishers for six rounds

373
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
with complexity two to the power of 51

374
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,959
which is way below

375
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,120
anything um we currently had uh

376
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
against chacha

377
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,759
and for seven rounds for the first time

378
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
uh distinguishing using the the framing

379
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,800
or work of uh should hoodie mitra

380
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
which

381
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
she

382
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
which was impossible to to get

383
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,279
a distribution for seven rounds now we

384
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
have one with complex two to the power

385
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,759
of 224

386
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,759
so

387
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,040
um

388
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,279
we showed in our paper that we can

389
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,160
actually get linear approximations up to

390
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
seven rounds

391
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
with smaller correlations uh provided

392
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
that we can

393
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
get a differentiate for three and a half

394
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
grounds

395
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,559
so we expect that this

396
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,199
it should be possible to to improve a

397
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,079
little bit for the attacks for anyone

398
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
that is interested so these these were

399
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,760
the the main results of our paper

400
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
and

401
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,919
but we

402
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,520
additionally found some new

403
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
differentials

404
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,919
um

405
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
as in previous works these differentials

406
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
were found experimentally

407
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
and to do that we divided the cipher in

408
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,720
three parts as presented in in the early

409
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,000
uh

410
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
in crypto 2020

411
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,360
and in that work the author showed that

412
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,400
the following differential

413
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
characteristic occurs if probably two to

414
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
the power of minus five on average

415
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
for the quadrant function of cha-cha

416
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,640
and this procedure is computationally

417
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,960
intensive as some of the correlations

418
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
are very small

419
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,679
and to achieve this amount of

420
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,080
computation we use eight nvd gpus

421
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
and we actually made

422
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
this code publicly available on github

423
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,559
anyone interested can can get the link

424
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
in our paper

425
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,600
and

426
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
as far as we know

427
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
this is the first code uh public

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
available of

429
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
crypt analyzes of charge

430
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
and

431
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
yeah this is this is the results of the

432
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
differentials that we could find for

433
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
three and a half

434
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
rounds

435
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
we should do note uh that uh since the

436
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
first version

437
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,919
of this

438
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,200
paper was published several independent

439
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
researchers reviewed our results and

440
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
code and we would like to thank juan

441
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,760
vasquez who didn't fight and a small

442
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,000
mistake in the code that we made

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
publicly available it was just a plus

444
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,360
one

445
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
and online but

446
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,480
we missed it but actually that

447
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,640
that affected the results of this table

448
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,600
and uh actually they at all

449
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,520
in 2021 independently noticed that the

450
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
results reports were not accurate and

451
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,280
computed an alternative version of this

452
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,320
table

453
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
so conclusions and future work

454
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
this work represented a new technique to

455
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
find linear approximations

456
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
for our ciphers and applying this

457
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
technique we presented new linear

458
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
approximations to this tree in cypher

459
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,360
chacha which gave us new and proven

460
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
distinguishers

461
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
and we expect that the proposed

462
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,200
technique can be used to improve attacks

463
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,960
against similar arcs based designs as

464
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,600
the string ciphered salsa and half

465
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
function black

466
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,640
additionally we believe that

467
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
maybe possible to improve

468
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,159
further the attacks against charge

469
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
um

470
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,720
because

471
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
uh as we

472
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
we showed

473
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
the the

474
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
linear correlations for the the the

475
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
differential

476
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
and position

477
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
bit zero of the word five

478
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
was higher than the one that you

479
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,000
actually used to to create attack

480
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
and the weight

481
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
of the linear correlation and the

482
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,120
complexity attack is higher to the on

483
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
the linear part thing is in the

484
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
differential part

485
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
so

486
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
maybe someone can find a compromise

487
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
there and

488
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,280
it may be possible to improve

489
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,520
a little bit more that talks to charge

490
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
using these techniques

491
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
so

492
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,520
yes

493
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
with that we finish our presentation

494
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
here are some references of course in

495
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
the paper

496
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,159
we you can get the full list of

497
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,440
references

498
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
and we would like to thank everyone that

499
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,400
got to this point of the presentation

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,960
thank you very much
