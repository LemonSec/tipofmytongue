00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,199
welcome to this eurocrypt 2021

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,359
presentation on one-way functions and

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,520
malleability oracles which is a talk

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,040
about hidden shift attacks on

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,599
isogeny-based protocols

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,519
this was joint work together with peter

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,079
kutash christophe pt and charlotte

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,640
whitecamper

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
in our work we show that for

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
overstretched and unbalanced parameters

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,279
a quantum sub-exponential attack on sidh

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,439
exists i'll get back to what this means

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,439
in a couple of minutes

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,279
the attack uses a reduction to an

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
injective abelian hidden shift problem

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
for seaside and isogen based protocols

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
based on ordinary curves it is known how

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,760
to solve the underlying problems in

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,320
quantum sub-exponential time via such a

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,719
reduction by the results of charles zhao

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,320
and tsukarev

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
yet a commonly widespread belief was

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
that the algorithm of childhood all does

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,680
not apply to sidh the argument was that

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,760
the algorithm relies crucially on an

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
abelian group action and therefore no

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
variant of it

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
would apply in the sadh setting

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
our work shows that for specific

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,119
parameter choices this widespread belief

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,560
is false

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
however let me add a disclaimer right

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
here the attack does not apply for

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
balanced sidh parameters as they were

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
originally suggested by java interfero

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,720
nor does it apply to psyc which is the

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
isogeny based submission to the nist

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
standardization process

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
instead the value of the paper consists

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
in showing that a completely different

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
attack vector exists for inadequate

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
parameter choices

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
let's start with a quick recap what

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,640
isogenes are

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
let e0 and e1 be elliptic curves defined

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
over a field k in cryptography we are

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
usually interested in those curves being

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,399
defined over a finite field

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
and isogeny is a non-constant rational

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,040
map between two curves that fixes the

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
identity or equivalently is also a group

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,399
homomorphism

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,399
recall that elliptic curves have a group

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
structure on them so this in particular

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,520
implies that the kernel of an isogeny is

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
a subgroup of e0

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
however

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
the other direction is also true every

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
finite subgroup of e0 defines a misogyny

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
indeed we have a one to one

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
correspondence between finite subgroups

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
of e0 and separable isogenes

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,200
which is the kind of isogeny i will be

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
mostly talking about in the following

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,080
for these isogenes the degree of the

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,319
esogenic which is the degree of the map

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,879
when written as a rational map equals

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,519
the cardinality of the kernel

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
this kernel of an isogeny determines the

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
image curve up to isomorphism which is

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
why it makes sense to write the image

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
curve as the quotient of the starting

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
curve and the kernel up to isomorphism

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,879
and elliptic curves that are isomorphic

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
share the same j invariant which

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
is an invariant that can be efficiently

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
computed

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,599
since for every isogeny there exists a

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
dual isogeny in the opposite direction

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
of the same degree this gives rise to an

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,400
undirected allies organic graph where

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,159
the vertices are j invariants of

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
elliptic curves and two vertices have an

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
edge in between them if and only if

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
there exists an isogeny of degree l

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
between those curves

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
asargenii based cryptography is one of

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
the candidates for post quantum

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,760
cryptography the core problem of the

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,799
area is to find large degree isogenes

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
between super singular elliptic curves

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
if you consider the previously mentioned

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
isogeny graph this could be interpreted

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
as a pathfinding problem where you're

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
given two vertices and in the graph and

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
you have to find a path connecting

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
most isogeny based crypto says systems

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
most famously sidh

99
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
are based on variants of this problem or

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,680
slight relaxations of this problem in

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
the sense that some additional

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
information is provided that might or

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
might not help to solve the pathfinding

104
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
problem

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
one advantage of isogeny based

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
cryptography besides being based on

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
really beautiful maths is that the key

108
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
sizes are much smaller compared to

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,439
cryptosystems of other post post-funded

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
candidates

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,399
the most prominent key exchange in

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
isogeny based cryptography is the super

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
singular isogenitive harman scheme which

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
was introduced by zhao and defeo in

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
2011.

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
it proceeds as follows let m1 and m2 be

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
smooth cobram integers usually they are

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
chosen to be a power of 2 and the power

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
of 3 respectively

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,080
and let p be a prime of the form n1

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
times n2 minus 1.

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
furthermore you fix the curve

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,520
e0 defined over fp squared

124
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,400
and two bases of

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
e0

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
namely of the n1 and the n2 torsion

127
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
alice then picks an order n1 subgroup of

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,199
e0 as her secret isogeny by choosing its

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
generator and similarly bob chooses an

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
order n2 subgroup of e0

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
both compute the isogeny corresponding

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
to their secret subgroup and send each

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
other the curve they arrive at say ea

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,919
and eb

135
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
and further alice sends the image of the

136
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,120
n2 torsion basis to bob and bob sends

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
the images of the n1 torsion basis to

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
alice

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,960
using this torsion point information

140
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
both alice and bob can translate their

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
secret isogeny onto the curve eb and ea

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
respectively which after one more

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,880
isogenic computation it allows them both

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
to compute the curve eav up to

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
isomorphism

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
essentially this works because we're

147
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
quotienting out two subgroups that only

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
trivially intersect

149
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
and then the order we do this in does

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,919
not matter since both alice and bob

151
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
arrive at an isomorphic curve the j

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
invariant is used as a shared secret

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
it is easy to see that recovering the

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,919
isogeny say phi a would allow to attack

155
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,680
the key exchange

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,240
given e0 and ea this would be an

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
instance of the pure esogenic problem

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
however we are also given additional

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
torsion point information

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
in our work we were looking whether this

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
additional torsion point information

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
makes it possible to reduce the problem

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
of path finding

164
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
or equivalently of recovering in

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,639
misogyny in this diagram to an instance

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,919
of the abelian hidden shift problem

167
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,800
the hidden shift problem is the

168
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,319
following

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
f0 and f1

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
are functions from the same group g to

171
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
some codomain x such that there exists

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,599
some group element sng that f0 evaluated

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,880
at any

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
group element equals

175
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
f1 evaluated at that same group element

176
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
times s

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
in multiplicative notation at least

178
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
the problem is to find

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
the shift s given oracle x access to

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
both functions f 0 and f 1.

181
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
if g is a billion and f 0 and f 1 are

182
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
injective this can be solved in quantum

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
sub-exponential time with respect to the

184
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
size of the group g using a quantum

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
computer

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,318
this is some result due to cooperback

187
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
let's look how

188
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
something like this might look

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
roughly for sidh

190
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
from now on let's assume we want to

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
recover the secret isogeny of alice

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
which is of degree n1 say a power of two

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
then the two isogeny graph starting at

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,080
e0 looks like

195
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,199
this

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
well we don't know alice's secret

197
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
isogeny we do know its degree so we do

198
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
not know the path but

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
that ea lies at a certain distance from

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
e0

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
assume we have a group action that acts

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,280
transitively on the possible kernel

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,599
subgroups defining paths to curves at

204
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
distance n1 from e0 that is all the

205
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
curves on the outer circle here

206
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,879
and let's assume that it's efficiently

207
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,560
computable given the curve and the

208
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
torsion point information that one has

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
an sidh

210
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
then if you take any other path of

211
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
correct length from a starting curve to

212
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,720
a curve say e a prime

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
then by transitivity of the group action

214
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
there exists one element in the acting

215
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,679
group that maps ea prime to ea

216
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
the idea behind our paper is that this

217
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
element is a shift and can be recovered

218
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,839
using a hidden shift algorithm

219
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
if some further conditions are satisfied

220
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,519
knowing this shift we can apply it to

221
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,560
the kernel of the misogyny from e0 to e

222
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,839
a prime

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,640
that we know because we picked it and

224
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
this will give us the kernel of the

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
isogeny from e0 to ea

226
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
so the secret of alice

227
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
let's make this idea more general and

228
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,440
let's consider what we actually need to

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
compute

230
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
to compute the pre-image of an injective

231
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
one-way function via a reduction to the

232
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
injective abelian hidden shift problem

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,519
[Music]

234
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
let f from some domain i to a codomino

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
be an injective one-way function and let

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
g be a group acting on the domain

237
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
we call a malleability oracle for g at

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
an image point of f say f i

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
an oracle that provides f of g times i

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
for any element g

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
in the acting group g

242
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
or put differently the malleability

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
oracle evaluates the function that on an

244
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
input

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
g

246
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
of the group evaluates f of

247
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
g times i

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
in some sense this is a

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
group action oracle but it might be

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,839
possible that more generally there are

251
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
schemes where one could redefine a

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,079
malleability oracle as some

253
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,920
knowledge relating certain inputs and

254
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,399
outputs

255
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,120
now the idea behind finding a pre-image

256
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
of f i by a reduction to the hidden

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
shift computation is fairly

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
straightforward if we make a couple more

259
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
assumptions on the acting group g let

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
the group g act transitively on the

261
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
domain of the injective one-way function

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
i and assume we have a malleability

263
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
oracle for g at f i where i is the

264
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
pre-image we want to compute

265
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
then if we pick any j in that domain we

266
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
know by transitivity that there exists

267
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
an element sigma such that

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
i equals sigma times j

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
define two functions f0 and f1 that map

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
the group elements of g

271
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
to the outputs of the one-way function

272
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
evaluated at

273
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,519
that group element times j and group

274
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,959
element times i respectively

275
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,279
g times j can be evaluated using the

276
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,800
knowledge of j

277
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,680
and

278
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
the knowledge of how to evaluate the

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
one-way function in

280
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,040
the easy direction

281
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
and f of

282
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
j times i can be computed using the

283
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
malleability oracle

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
these two functions are hidden shifts of

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
one another and using a hidden shift

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
algorithm this shift can be computed in

287
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,320
quant quantum sub-exponential time

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
at least if we further assume that f is

289
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
injective and g is a finitely generated

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
billion group acting freely on the

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,959
domain i

292
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,120
this is uh to ensure that the solution

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
is unique and that it can be computed

294
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,079
with a

295
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,360
sub-exponential quantum algorithm

296
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,399
having computed a sigma like the shift

297
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,959
of both function we can then compute i

298
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,040
simply by computing the action of sigma

299
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,439
on j

300
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
let's get back to sidh

301
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,320
for a fixed starting curve in sidh this

302
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
is typically typically the curve

303
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
with j and variant 1728 or one of the

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,519
close neighbors

305
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
and let

306
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
n1 and n2 be security parameters of

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,720
alice and bob

308
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
as before then the one-way function

309
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
underlying alice's secret isogeny is the

310
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,320
map sending and one-order subgroups of a

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
e0

312
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,560
to a curve at distance n1 from e0 and

313
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
the image of the basis of the end-to-end

314
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
portion

315
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,079
note that this function can be

316
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
efficiently evaluated using values

317
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,120
formula

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
but computing three images is the hard

319
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,040
problem underlying sadh

320
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
in our work we show that we can give a

321
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
malleability oracle for this one-way

322
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
function under certain conditions more

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
precisely let g be a multiplicative

324
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,519
subgroup of the endomorphism ring of e0

325
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,399
modulo and one where each equivalence

326
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
class contains an endomorphism of degree

327
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
co-prime to the degree of alice's secret

328
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
misogyny phi

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,959
then a malleability oracle for this

330
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
group g at ea

331
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,839
which is

332
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,399
the

333
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,959
starting curve e0 divided out by

334
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,360
alice's secret k should provide the

335
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
curve e0 divided out by

336
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,959
theta of k where theta is the

337
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
endomorphism

338
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,680
by the co-formality of the degrees of

339
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
theta and phi we have the following

340
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
commutative diagram

341
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
and you can see that e0 divided out by

342
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
theta of the kernel of phi is isomorphic

343
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
to ea divided out by phi of the kernel

344
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,600
of theta

345
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
since we do not know the kernel of phi

346
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
we cannot compute the action of theta on

347
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
it however the idea in our paper is to

348
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
lift the endomorphism theta to an

349
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,920
endomorphism theta prime that has the

350
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,639
same action on the domain i of our

351
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
one-way function but it's of degree n2

352
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
or dividing into

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
for such here theta prime for which we

354
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,519
know the kernel and for which we know

355
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,360
that it's kernelized in the m2 torsion

356
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
of e0 we can then evaluate phi of the

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
kernel of

358
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
theta prime

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
this is because the torsion information

360
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
sidh of the n2 torsion points allows to

361
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
compute the images of all points of

362
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
order n2 in particular if the kernel of

363
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
the theta prime is in the m2 torsion we

364
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
can evaluate phi on it

365
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
but then given e a and phi of the kernel

366
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
of theta prime

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
allows to evaluate the bottom right

368
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
corner of the commutative diagram which

369
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,360
is the same as evaluating the

370
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
malleability orbital

371
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
apart from this malleability oracle for

372
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,480
sidh to use the general reduction to the

373
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
hidden shift problem outlined earlier

374
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
there's some more tasks that had to be

375
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,240
solved

376
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,040
first we had to partition the domain of

377
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
the one-way function so the kernel

378
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
subgroups of alice

379
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,720
uh well

380
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
that could alice could potentially pick

381
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
into large partitions such that sidh

382
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
one-way function

383
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,120
that the sadh one-way function is

384
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,560
injective on each of those partitions

385
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,720
we did this by explicitly writing down

386
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
three partitions

387
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
for each partition we then find an

388
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
abelian subgroup of the endomorphism

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
ring containing anamorphisms of degree

390
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,440
co-prime two and one that act freely and

391
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,959
transitively on each partition

392
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,519
and finally we give an algorithm to lift

393
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
elements from these acting groups say g

394
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,959
to anamorphisms of norm m2

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
this is in order for us to have a

396
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
malleability oracle as described on the

397
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
previous slide

398
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
while we give such solutions

399
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
for the first two tasks in general

400
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,519
the lifting algorithm we provide works

401
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
only if we allow sadh parameters where

402
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,600
n2 so bob's security parameter is larger

403
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,560
than p

404
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
and significantly larger than n1

405
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
this is what we call overstretched and

406
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,639
unbalanced

407
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
more precisely we choose the group

408
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
acting on alice's secret key space such

409
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,759
that each element can be represented as

410
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
an endomorphism of the form for venus

411
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,839
endomorphism times set i where i is the

412
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
non-trivial automorphism of e0

413
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
the task therefore reduces to lifting

414
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
endomorphisms of this form to norm n2

415
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
we solve this by solving a norm equation

416
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
similar to the one at the core of the

417
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
klpt algorithm where klpt stands for

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
call lgpt and t mode

419
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
unfortunately well unfortunately

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
this algorithm works only for n2 greater

421
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
p times n1 to the fourth and under some

422
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
heuristics also for n2 greater than p

423
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,480
and one to the n one cubed

424
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,040
however the way we solve their lifting

425
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
we would not expect solutions if m2 is

426
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,720
less or equal p and one squared this is

427
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
also the reason why the attack does not

428
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
in its current form apply to balanced

429
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
snah parameters or psych

430
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,079
with some more formal background let's

431
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
take one more look at the two isogeny

432
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
graph containing alice's blue secret

433
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
path

434
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,880
in our paper we put the end nodes of the

435
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
different paths into

436
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
three different partitions

437
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
on each partition

438
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
we have an abelian free and transitive

439
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
group action of endomorphism modulo n1

440
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
now by picking any path that lies in the

441
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
same partition as alice's secret we get

442
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
to the curve e a prime which can be

443
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
mapped by the group action to ea

444
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,559
this follow follows by transitivity and

445
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
basically by having three partitions

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
there are three choices

447
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
for such a j

448
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
we define two functions one that sends

449
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
elements of the acting group of the

450
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
curve you get when applying the group

451
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
action on the esogen is leading to ea

452
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
prime the other one when applying the

453
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
group action to the isogeny leading to

454
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
ea

455
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,720
the first function we can evaluate

456
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
because we know the pink path and we can

457
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
just compute the endomorphism on its

458
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
kernel

459
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
this gives us another isogeny of the

460
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
same length that we can then just

461
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
evaluate

462
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
the second function

463
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
the one that computes the group action

464
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
on ea we can evaluate using the

465
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,280
malleability oracle essentially giving

466
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
given an endomorphism of e0 we find

467
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
another endomorphism of e0 that has the

468
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,799
same action on the n1 origin

469
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,280
but is of degree and 2.

470
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
we use the torsion point information

471
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,679
provided by alice on ea

472
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,960
and compute

473
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,919
the curve at distance n1 from e0 that

474
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,600
one would get when applying this

475
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
endomorphism to the kernel of the secret

476
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,320
surgery

477
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,559
both of the functions we define are

478
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,280
injective they are shifts of one another

479
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,919
and the acting group is abelian

480
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,440
using a hidden shift algorithm like

481
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
cooper backs we then find the shift

482
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
corresponding to the red arrow in the

483
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
picture

484
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
and this allows to compute the kernel of

485
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,280
the secret blue isogeny from the

486
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
known pingas argent

487
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
let me summarize the key contributions

488
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
of the paper

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
it provides a new attack vector and

490
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
sidh-like protocols via a reduction to

491
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
the abelian hidden shift problem but the

492
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,320
attack only works for unbalanced and

493
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
overstretched sidh parameters

494
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,080
yet the results show that despite sidh's

495
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
non-commutative nature there's an

496
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
abelian group action on its key space

497
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
that can be used for this kind of attack

498
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
as opposed to previous hand-wavy

499
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
arguments why such an attack should not

500
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
exist we give some bounce for when we

501
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
expect the attack to actually work

502
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,799
we describe which algebraic properties

503
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,640
are necessary for the attack in general

504
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,880
terms and this captures some previous

505
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
attacks such as the one

506
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,000
of charles zhao and zukarif and we hope

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,559
