1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,439
okay so this is joint work with michael

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,839
mayer and michael narig now i have a

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,720
habit of um really talking over time

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,719
when i do these pre-recorded talks so

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,639
i'm going to try to talk relatively

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,840
quickly

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,679
but you can slow down the the playback

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,440
speed if it's going too fast

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
so in this work

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,560
we're very interested in looking for

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
numbers like the two highlighted in the

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
middle of the screen

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,240
like most good problems in mathematics

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
or computational number theory

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,920
it's again one of those problems that's

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
quite easy to state and easy to

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,960
understand what the problem is but it

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,320
turns out it's

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,840
not as easy as you would hope to solve

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
the problem

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
so the reason we're looking for two

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
numbers like the the two in the middle

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
of the screen is that when we write

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
prime factorization both of these

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
numbers are very smooth

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
certainly with with uh in reference to

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
their neighbors relative to the numbers

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,000
that that are close by the largest prime

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
factor occurring in these two

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,559
consecutive integers is 47.

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,400
so the problem we're trying to solve is

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
to find two consecutive integers

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
whose product

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
is very very smooth with respect to some

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
fixed spoon this bound so you can see

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
that the surrounding numbers have uh

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,439
prime their largest prime factors are a

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
lot bigger than 47 but these two are

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
very very smooth uh relative to

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
the numbers that they're surrounded by

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
so the rest of the talk is

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
going to go like this so i'm first of

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,040
all going to motivate why we're

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,479
interested in the problem

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,159
um and then i'm going to talk about some

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
first attempts at trying to find

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,799
twin smooths before we move to the the

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
point of this work and and the

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
improvements that we found in this paper

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
which is the pte sieve

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
okay so why are we interested in this

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
problem

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
well some very recent constructions of

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
isogeny based public key protocols

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,200
are both reliant on finding

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
uh two consecutive smooth integers

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
in fact they're relying on a special

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
case of the problem where not only do we

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
find two consecutive smooth integers but

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
we find

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
these integers where their sum is a

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
prime okay so what these schemes rely on

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
is finding a prime of the form two m

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
plus one large prime to n plus one such

65
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,560
that m and n plus one

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
are both smooth uh and therefore p plus

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
or minus one which is two m and two n

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
plus two

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
are also both smooth

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
so what we're looking for to state the

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,599
problem concisely is we're looking for

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,319
two twin smooth numbers whose sum is a

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,360
prime

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
and if we find such an instance then we

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
can we can instantiate uh b side and ski

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
sine and perhaps some

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,239
other variants of these protocols

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,160
to be more efficient than

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,519
if we were to instantiate them over a

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
prime who's whose neighbors are not so

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,319
smooth

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
so really the efficiency of these

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
schemes is very very dependent on

84
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,760
the uh largest prime factor

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,480
appearing in p plus one or p minus one

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
now to just unpack that for a moment uh

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
recall that in srdh and psych

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
alice and bob set this

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,920
prime p to be a power of two times a

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
power of three minus one and that's

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,519
because alice computes two to the a

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
isogenes and bob computes three to the b

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
isogenys and for those isogenic

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
computations to be um

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,519
to be efficient

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
uh within the protocol

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,959
we want those

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
two factors the two to the a and the

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,519
three to the b

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
three to the power of b to divide p plus

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
one

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
but it turns out that

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,319
alice and bob don't both need to squeeze

104
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
their their isogeny degrees into p plus

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
one it turns out that they can actually

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,959
um split so that alice alice uses prime

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
factors of p plus one and bob unit uses

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
prime factors of p minus one

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
so if we take p plus one to be two times

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
m and p minus one to be two times n then

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
quite trivially the the gcd of m n must

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,319
be one the only common factor of p plus

113
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,239
one and p minus one can be

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
two

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,599
um so alice is going to compute m

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
isogenys and bob is going to compute n

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
isogenes and what we're looking for is

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
for m and n to be as smooth as possible

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
so ideally what we would have is that m

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
was 2 to the a just like before and n

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,199
was 3 to the b

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
just like before but unfortunately the

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
largest such prime

124
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
where m and n can both be of this form

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
is 17.

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,080
so the largest pair of

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
twins that are three smooth the largest

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
pair of consecutive integers that are

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,840
three smooth are eight and nine

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
there's no larger consecutive integers

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
that

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
uh

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
whose largest prime factor is is less

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
than three

135
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
uh and it turns out that their sum is

136
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
the prime 17. so that's our best

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
uh prime that sits between two three

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
smooth numbers

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
so given that 17 is the largest such

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
number that's sandwiched between a power

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
of 2 and a power of 3 or 2 times a power

142
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
of 2 and 2 times a power of 3. what we

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,199
want to do is to be able to bump up the

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
size of that prime to be

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
cryptographically sized so say

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
bigger than 200 bits

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,080
such that it's sandwiched between two

148
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,880
numbers whose prime factorization it's

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
not going to be prime powers for reasons

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,320
that i won't get into but whose

151
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
factorization contains only primes that

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
are that are up to some bound so in this

153
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
next stage i'm going to define what twin

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
smooths are and look at the first

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
attempts that were that were

156
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
made at trying to to find large

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
cryptographically sized ones

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,639
so let's just recall what the definition

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
of smoothness is so an integer is said

160
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,600
to be b smooth if it has no prime

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
factors larger than b so typically we

162
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,639
fix some smoothness bound big b

163
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
and we look for integers whose

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
prime factors are no no bigger than b

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
now two consecutive integers m and m

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,919
plus one

167
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
are called b smooth twins

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
if their product is b smooth so if each

169
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,039
of them is b smooth their product will

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,840
be b smooth and vice

171
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
versa uh

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
so that's what we're looking for we're

173
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,520
looking for numbers m and n plus one

174
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
that are both be smooth

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,319
now

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
i'll ignore the the um criteria of their

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
pr their sum being a prime for most of

178
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
the talk but it should be said that this

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
is a lot more rare for the types of

180
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
numbers we'll be looking for

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,800
um finding these consecutive smooths is

182
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,440
a lot more difficult than uh hoping that

183
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
their pro that their sum is a prime so

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
we're looking for ways that we can find

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
enough

186
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,120
enough of these uh twin smooth pairs at

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,440
a given size because once we find enough

188
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
of them then um heuristically we're

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,470
guaranteed that or or we should be

190
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,639
[Music]

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,840
we should have a very good probability

192
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,240
that their sum will be a prime um

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
certainly if they can they both contain

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
many small factors that are um and

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
they're co-prime to each other then that

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,160
rules out uh their sum having either of

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,720
those factors um and so actually this

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
their sun being a prime is is a little

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
more likely than a random a random

200
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
number of the same size

201
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
okay so for concreteness our goal is to

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
find this prime that is sandwiched

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
between two smooth integers

204
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
or equivalently as i said we're looking

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
for these two consecutive integers m and

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,120
m plus one

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,039
that are both smooth

208
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
and if we find enough of them we'll be

209
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
able to find such a pair whose sum is a

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
is a prime but for the

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,319
for for the remainder of the talk just

212
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,520
think that we're trying to find two

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,479
consecutive

214
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
smooth integers of a large cryptographic

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,560
size

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
now if we fix the smoothness bound and

217
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
look for

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
look for the largest

219
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
uh consecutive smooth integers with

220
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,479
respect to that smoothness bound that is

221
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
a problem that has a deterministic

222
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
solution it's just that finding

223
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
all such pairs and therefore finding the

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
largest such pair is it takes

225
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
exponential time so

226
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
to give some examples the largest three

227
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
smooth twins the largest consecutive

228
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
integers that are whose product is three

229
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
smooth is eight and nine it just so

230
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
happens that their sum is also prime as

231
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,120
we saw before the largest five

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
consecutive smooth twins are 80 and 81

233
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,199
it just so happens that their sum is

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
also a prime in general the largest

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
uh consecutive m smooth uh the b smooth

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,800
twins

237
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
um won't have a prime sum but if again

238
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
if we find all of them then one of the

239
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,240
largest ones will will have a have a

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
prime sum

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
uh and so here we've also listed the

242
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,760
largest 113 smooth twins

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
they have m

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
being around

245
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
74 bits

246
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
okay and then the largest 113 smooth

247
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
twins whose sum is a prime

248
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
is less than that uh less than that

249
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,920
example it's around 66 bits

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
and as i said uh and and i won't get

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
into the details here but to find

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
the largest b smooth twins in fact to

253
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
find all of the pairs of b smooth twins

254
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
um you have to solve two to the power of

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,279
pi b pell equations where pi b is the

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
number of primes up to b

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
so i think 113 there's uh

258
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
including 113 there's

259
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,720
30 30 primes up to 113 so finding that

260
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,360
largest 113 smooth twins required the

261
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
solution of

262
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,279
2 to the 30 pell equations that's not

263
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,040
really an easy task so going much higher

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,279
using this exhaustive method is is

265
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
becomes computationally infeasible quite

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
quickly and turns out that we can't um

267
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,760
these m's are not big enough to be

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
cryptographically secure remember we

269
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
want these m's to be at least 200 bits

270
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,399
in size so exhausting all of the b

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,080
smooth twins for a given smoothness

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,320
bound b turns out to be infeasible for

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
our purposes

274
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
now something that's kind of important

275
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,399
to understand this work is

276
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
smoothness probability so when we're

277
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,880
looking at numbers of a certain size

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
we want to know what the probability of

279
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
them being be smooth with respect to a

280
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
fixed smoothness boundary is and the way

281
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
that this uh these heuristics in this

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,320
theory is presented is by presenting the

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
smoothness bound

284
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
as the youth

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,399
root

286
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,560
of the number you're looking at so

287
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
the probability that an integer m

288
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
is b smooth where b is m to the power of

289
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,959
1 over u

290
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,880
is given by this row function this

291
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
dickman row function

292
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
and all of these heuristics rely on m

293
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
approaching infinity but for our

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
purposes

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
our numbers are close enough to infinity

296
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
that these heuristics are quite good

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,320
so suppose we take a random m of 256

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
bits

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
the probability that it is 2 to the 128

300
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
smooth so the probability that it has no

301
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,839
prime factors

302
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,480
bigger than 2 to the 128

303
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
is roughly 3 tenths so it's row of 2.

304
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
the probability that m is 2 to the 64

305
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
smooth so it contains no prime factors

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
that are more than a quarter of its bit

307
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,000
length

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
is

309
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
roughly 1 in 200

310
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
and you get the point that the

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
probability that the largest prime

312
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
factor

313
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,959
isn't

314
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
isn't bigger than one-eighth of its bit

315
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,760
length becomes very very small 3.2 by 10

316
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
to the negative eight and so on so we've

317
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
got this we've got this concrete way to

318
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,120
write down the probability that part of

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
a number that a given number a number of

320
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,200
a given size

321
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
is smooth with respect to a smoothness

322
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
bound so long as we write that

323
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,640
smoothness bound uh as as one over u

324
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
um now obviously if u is one the

325
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,160
probability is one because the

326
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,200
probability that m is m smooth is is one

327
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
but

328
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,279
as long as

329
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
the bigger u gets or the smaller that we

330
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
want the prime factors this probability

331
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
degrades uh exponentially

332
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,279
now this row function gives us a really

333
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,240
uh

334
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,560
easy way to analyze

335
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
methods that we

336
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
methods that we use to try to construct

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,240
or to try to find these these twin

338
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,680
smooth numbers

339
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,760
so on this slide i'm going to talk about

340
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,600
the three prior methods prior to this

341
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
work

342
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
that we use to to try to look for for

343
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
twin smooths

344
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
um and just for the sake of concreteness

345
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,279
we're going to assume that we're looking

346
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
for

347
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
256 bit numbers so m and m plus 1 are

348
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
close to 2 to the 256

349
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
and let's suppose our smoothness bound b

350
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
is 2 to the 16.

351
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,760
so

352
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,639
the

353
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
the easiest way to look for these

354
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
numbers now for the

355
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
as far as the whole slide goes

356
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,560
if you see a green number

357
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
that's a number that's um that we can

358
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
construct to be smooth okay and then the

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,839
red number is something that we hope to

360
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,120
be smooth

361
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,839
so in the first

362
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
example we're looking for we can easily

363
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,880
construct

364
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
uh m's that are smooth so we can just

365
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,440
take any any product of numbers that are

366
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
less than b

367
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,800
uh such that the product is is two to

368
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
the around two to the 256 and then what

369
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,079
we're hoping is that either m or m plus

370
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
m minus 1 or m plus 1 is is smooth

371
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,880
so the probability that a 256 bit number

372
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
is

373
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,959
um

374
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
is

375
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
2 to the 16 smooth

376
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,600
that would be the row function of

377
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
16

378
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
which is uh 2 to the minus 70. so our

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
chances of finding of constructing an m

380
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
that's smooth and then it's one of its

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,839
neighbors miraculously being smooth is

382
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,639
close to 2 to the minus 70. so it really

383
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
means that we'd have to try 2 to the 70

384
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,360
uh such such smooth numbers m until we

385
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
can expect to find

386
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
a smooth

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
a smooth pair a pair of twin smooths a

388
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
slightly better approach that gives us a

389
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
better probability is the extended gcd

390
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
approach so what we do there is we

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
choose two numbers a and b that are both

392
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
around half the bit length of m

393
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
and we use the extended euclidean

394
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
algorithm to

395
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,199
find coprime numbers s and t such that a

396
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,760
times s plus b times t is one

397
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,839
and then as long as we arrange the sines

398
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,160
properly then we get

399
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
the absolute value of a times s and the

400
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
absolute b value of b times t differ by

401
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
one

402
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,639
and then what we're hoping is that both

403
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,720
s and t were smooth

404
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,519
now the chances of two numbers that are

405
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
128 bits being 2 to the 16 smooth

406
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,440
is a lot better um it's two than minus

407
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
50 but it still means we'd have to

408
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
search over a lot of

409
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
a lot of a b pairs until we find an s

410
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
and t

411
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
that turn out to be 2 to the 16 smooth

412
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,199
so again the the intuition here is that

413
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,600
the smaller we chop up these numbers

414
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,199
um

415
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,160
rather than looking for one 256 bit

416
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
one 256 bit number that's that's smooth

417
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
it's it's a lot better to look for two

418
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
to the one two 128 bit numbers um that

419
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
are smooth and the intuition there is

420
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
uh it kind of rules out any factors that

421
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
are bigger than two to the 128 that

422
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
could have appeared in the first method

423
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,000
um

424
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
so to

425
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
now look at the third method is this

426
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
power method where we set m to be some

427
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,040
power of x

428
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,760
some small nth power in this case n

429
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
equals six

430
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
and then m minus one

431
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
is

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
x to the six minus one and we're

433
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,639
guaranteed that m minus one

434
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,680
factors

435
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,079
as x plus one times x minus one times

436
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
these two quadratic terms

437
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,800
so

438
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,759
these

439
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,360
they're setting the fir the larger

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
number to be a power of a power of x

441
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
and then uh looking at the

442
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
looking at the the

443
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
the smaller number as the power of x

444
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,480
minus one

445
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
you're guaranteed that these two things

446
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,639
factorizes as shown and then the the

447
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
hope is that these smaller pieces um

448
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
these smaller pieces

449
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
uh are smooth and the probability of

450
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,959
each of the smaller pieces being smooth

451
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,759
is again in this case a lot better than

452
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
uh the probability that a a random

453
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
number of the the large sizes is smooth

454
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
now prior to this paper the best

455
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
examples in the literature

456
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
uh were found using this third method um

457
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,519
so

458
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,800
here's a couple of examples with uh

459
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
n plus one being x to the power of six

460
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
and n minus one being the product of

461
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,759
those two linear terms in the two

462
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,360
quadratic terms

463
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,079
so in the first example uh alice

464
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,600
actually has

465
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
the the factorization of p plus one or m

466
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,199
plus one

467
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
uh is two to the sixth smooth or in this

468
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
case it's 53 smooth so her x is this

469
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
this value that's raised to the power of

470
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,000
six and then over on bob's side his uh

471
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
his val his

472
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
factorization that the largest prime

473
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
factor there is um less than two to the

474
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
20. so that occurs as one of the prime

475
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,199
factors of the the first quadratic term

476
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
x squared minus x plus one

477
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,759
um and then in a more balanced example a

478
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,280
slightly more balanced example the

479
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,799
second example

480
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
alice chose an x that was 2 to the 12th

481
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
move and over on bob's side he got a he

482
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
got a factorization of of x to the 6

483
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
minus 1 that was 2 to the 19 smooth

484
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,480
so roughly speaking i think two

485
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
b being close to two to the 19 was the

486
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,599
best

487
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
um in terms of numbers that were close

488
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,160
to 256 bits was the best kind of

489
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,559
smoothness bound that um

490
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,120
the the twin the twin smooth satisfied

491
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,879
prior to the prior to this work

492
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
okay so what do we do in this paper that

493
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
improves upon that that third method

494
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
well if you look closely at the at the

495
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
row function as applied to that third

496
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,240
method

497
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
the problem with it is these higher

498
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
degree terms these two quadratic terms

499
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,360
so if we were searching over x's to to

500
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
find x to the 6 and x to the 6 minus 1

501
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
being

502
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
roughly 256 bits we're searching for x's

503
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
that are around 2 to the 42

504
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,720
and in that case the probability of x

505
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
itself or x minus 1 or x plus 1 being b

506
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
smooth is far greater than the

507
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
probability of the quadratic terms being

508
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,919
b smooth

509
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
so for example with b is 2 to the 14 the

510
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
probability that a 42 bit number

511
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
is 2 to the 14 smooth that's the row

512
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,919
function of 3 which is roughly 1 in 20

513
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,720
or 0.0486

514
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
but the probability of a

515
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
of the quadratic term being smooth

516
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
is

517
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
the row of 6 which is

518
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
10 to the negative 5 or 2 times 10 to

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
the negative 5.

520
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,080
um

521
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
so the idea that we're that we're trying

522
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,679
to look at in this work is

523
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,200
can we find

524
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
uh m and m plus 1 that are both

525
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,480
polynomial functions ratio rational

526
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,200
polynomial functions where f of x and g

527
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,559
of x split completely into linear terms

528
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,280
so

529
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
if we're talking about degree in the

530
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,440
degree 2 case that's rather easy we can

531
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,919
take f x to be x squared and g of x to

532
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,679
be x squared minus one

533
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,320
and we've got a factorization of of both

534
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
f of x and g of x into linear terms but

535
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
what we really want is to find

536
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
uh

537
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
to find f of x and g of x with with

538
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
degrees

539
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,919
uh a fair bit larger than two

540
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
uh so that the the probability of these

541
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
these factors um

542
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
being uh

543
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,520
being smooth with respect to a fixed

544
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,520
smoothness bound becomes much greater

545
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
so what we're looking for here

546
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,640
is we're looking for split polynomials

547
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,919
in uh in the polynomial ring uh

548
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,160
whose coefficients are rational

549
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
with constant differences

550
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,880
so rather than differing by one we can

551
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
we can relax the requirement that the

552
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
polynomials differ by one and actually

553
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,039
tolerate constant differences

554
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
um so in this example this these two

555
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
degree four f of x and g of x functions

556
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
um they they differ by 180 so they

557
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
differ by a constant

558
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,520
but then what we can do

559
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
is we can search over

560
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,799
x

561
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
such that f of x and g of x are both 0

562
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,360
mod 180

563
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,159
therefore dividing f x and g of x at a

564
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
particular value of x

565
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,559
um by 180 you'll get two integers that

566
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
differ by one

567
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,640
okay so to to kind of give a high level

568
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
over overview of what we're doing here

569
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
we're not searching for

570
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
large numbers m such that m plus one is

571
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
smooth but rather we're going to search

572
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,799
for a lot smaller values of x

573
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,280
such that a bunch of these linear terms

574
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,600
that are that are much smaller because x

575
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,919
is much smaller are all smooth so the

576
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,000
the probability that in this case

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,440
uh

578
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,679
one 256 bit number is is b smooth will

579
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,000
be a lot less than the probability of

580
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
say seven or eight uh

581
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,520
uh

582
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,720
64-bit numbers being being b smooth

583
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,720
now it turns out that the main

584
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
difficulty in applying this approach to

585
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
find to find twin smooth integers

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,559
is in finding these polynomials f of x

587
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
and g of x that differ by a constant and

588
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
that that completely split over the

589
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
rationals

590
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
now after trying to construct them

591
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
ourselves for a while and running into

592
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
problems beyond degree uh degree three

593
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,960
and four

594
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
uh we dug around the literature and it

595
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,360
turns out that this problem is um

596
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,240
is

597
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
connected to what's called the prager

598
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
terry ascot problem

599
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,919
now this problem

600
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
the the ideal formulation of this

601
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
problem is to find

602
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
two disjoint multisets

603
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,000
a set of integers a1 through a n and b1

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
through bn

605
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,200
such that their uh their sum is the same

606
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,919
the sum of their squares is the same

607
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
and the sum of their all of their powers

608
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,200
up to the nth minus one powers is also

609
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
the same so these two sets can't contain

610
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
the same integer

611
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
uh but

612
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
they they need to have the same sum and

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
the same sum of squares and the same sum

614
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,760
of cubes and so on up to the n minus

615
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,640
month

616
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
uh powers all sum together

617
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
so that example the example of the two

618
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
polynomials on the previous slide

619
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
actually comes from

620
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
uh the solution to the the pte problem

621
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,919
where

622
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
the first set is 0 4 7 and 11 and the

623
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
second set is 1 2 9 10. and that's

624
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,559
because the the sum of the numbers in

625
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
these two sets is the same the sum of

626
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
their squares is the same and the sum of

627
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,240
their cubes is the same and it turns out

628
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,159
that that's as as much as you could hope

629
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
for um is the n n minus one powers of

630
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,559
all these uh these integers to be the

631
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
same

632
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,320
and it's rather straightforward to see

633
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
the connection between the solutions to

634
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
the pte problem and how they turn into

635
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
the into the two polynomials that we're

636
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
looking for in fact all we do is take

637
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
uh a linear function of who's whose

638
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,679
roots are all of the uh solution in the

639
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,760
solutions in the first set and a linear

640
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,039
function whose roots are all the

641
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,720
solutions in the second set

642
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
and it turns out that these will always

643
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
have a difference um

644
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
a constant difference when

645
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,679
viewed as polynomials over the rationals

646
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,000
now it turns out that finding solutions

647
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to the pte problem is is rather

648
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
non-trivial but fortunately for our

649
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
purposes

650
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,039
a lot of this hard work had been done

651
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,320
for us already

652
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
um so there's a there's a fair few

653
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,440
methods out there that not only find um

654
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,400
not only find solutions but also allow

655
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,559
uh infinitely many solutions to be

656
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,000
generated from

657
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
a given solution to the to the pte

658
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,159
problem

659
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,559
so in particular when we were looking

660
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,799
for integers of around 256 bits in size

661
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,679
it turns out that the solutions with n

662
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,120
equals 6 was somewhat of a sweet spot

663
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,480
now that's not only because um the

664
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,559
number of solutions

665
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,520
uh

666
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,159
was plentiful it's also because the

667
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,480
power n being 6

668
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,559
is rather convenient so

669
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
we don't want n to be too large because

670
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,880
if n's too large it really shrinks the

671
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
search space

672
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,159
of our x's so in this case if n was 12

673
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
then we only get roughly 2 to the 22

674
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
values of x that we can search over for

675
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
smoothness

676
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
but if n is too small then the

677
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
probability of the the linear terms

678
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
being smooth with respect to a fixed

679
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,480
bound becomes a lot smaller so in this

680
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
case n equals 6 was right on the money

681
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,679
because then what we're looking for is

682
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,400
is 12

683
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
12 functions of linear functions of x

684
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
that are smooth with respect to a given

685
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,760
bound

686
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,640
and

687
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,320
n equals 6 means that we're searching

688
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,320
over x's being roughly 2 to the 43 in

689
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,039
size so we've got enough x's there to to

690
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,840
be able to sieve and look for for smooth

691
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
uh for those 12

692
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,399
linear terms to be smooth

693
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,600
just got really dark all of a sudden

694
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
anyway

695
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
i'm gonna go over this uh next bit

696
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
pretty quick because it's all kind of

697
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
standard stuff from the literature but

698
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,720
uh the first phase of our saving

699
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,279
algorithm um needs to identify all of

700
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
the smooth numbers in a given interval

701
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
so i'm going to give an example here

702
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,480
using the smoothness bound b equals 7.

703
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,640
we're going to sieve the 50 numbers from

704
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
4350 to 43.99 so the first thing we do

705
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,520
is in every place we we put a 1 we start

706
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
with a one

707
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
and then we start with all of the primes

708
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
up to b starting with two

709
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
and we look at all the multiples of two

710
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
and we multiply the the running uh the

711
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
running product underneath each number

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,840
by two then we do the multiples of four

713
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,039
multiples of two cubed which is eight

714
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,720
multiples of two to the four and we keep

715
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
doing multiples of

716
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,600
two until there's no multiple

717
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
in the interval the last one being 2 to

718
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
the 6 64

719
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,559
or 2 to the 7 128 rather

720
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,360
to d6 i should have said

721
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,039
and then there's no multiples of 2 to

722
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,400
the 9 in that interval so we're done

723
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,320
with 2.

724
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,799
we do the same thing for three

725
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,400
three squared

726
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
three q

727
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,200
three to the

728
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
four three

729
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
five three to the six three to the seven

730
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,559
multiples of five

731
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,520
we keep

732
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,840
going

733
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,000
[Music]

734
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
multiplying the the products underneath

735
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
each number by the

736
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,440
given multiple

737
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
and

738
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
until we're done so

739
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,320
with the multiples of seven

740
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,039
and then

741
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
once we've processed all of the primes

742
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
up to b we look at all the numbers in

743
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
that interval

744
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
and if any number

745
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
underneath its index is the same as the

746
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
number we know that that number is seven

747
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
smooth so in this case there's only two

748
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,840
numbers in the interval that are seven

749
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,360
smooth and they happen to be twin

750
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
smooths four three seven four and four

751
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,799
three seven five

752
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,000
so that we when we write out their

753
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
factorization of course we're guaranteed

754
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,919
that uh there's no primes bigger than

755
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
seven

756
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,039
so all that we need to do then is to

757
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
have one bit of information in each

758
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,679
index that corresponds to whether that

759
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
index was smooth or not whether that

760
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,039
number was smooth or not

761
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,799
um so we put two ones in the smooth

762
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,679
numbers and the rest of them were

763
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,840
non-smooth with respect to seven so

764
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,960
we've

765
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,559
sieved the whole interval and we've

766
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,760
marked

767
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,000
uh the smooth numbers with ones and left

768
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,840
the the non-smooth numbers as

769
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,520
zeros now i gave the naive version of

770
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,240
the the sieving but uh this book the

771
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
prime numbers book by crandall and

772
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
pomeranz gives a lot more optimizations

773
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
that are much better in practice so we

774
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,039
can replace

775
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,399
um

776
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,520
the numbers themselves with their

777
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
logarithms and that means we can uh

778
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
start with zeros all along and then we

779
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,679
can replace all of the multiple uh the

780
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,799
multipliers with additions we can use

781
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,159
approximations and we can skip the small

782
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,840
primes and do all sorts of uh

783
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,679
probabilistic versions of the sieving

784
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,120
that are much faster in practice

785
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,320
okay so now we come to phase two of the

786
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,520
the pt sieve so what i just described is

787
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,679
phase one that's the standard stuff

788
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,559
the the second phase is how we use

789
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,480
the pte solutions

790
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
uh to once we've sieved the interval we

791
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
we then check for ones that align with

792
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
our pte solutions

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
so now let's illustrate with a much

794
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
bigger example a kind of real real sized

795
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
example

796
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,840
um with b equals to the power of 15 and

797
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,559
the 50 numbers in this interval here so

798
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,640
suppose we've done step one with all the

799
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
primes from 2 3 5 7 all the way to 32

800
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
749

801
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
all the primes up to 2 to the 15. we've

802
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,399
sieved the interval exactly as i

803
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
described before

804
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,440
and at the end of the day we've

805
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
identified the smooth numbers in that

806
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,840
interval

807
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
and and marked those indexes with one

808
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
and the other indexes indices are marked

809
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,840
with with zero

810
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,240
now the output of

811
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
that step

812
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
is just a bit string of length 50 in

813
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,200
that case but of length the size of the

814
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
interval so once we've done phase one

815
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
we've processed the whole interval we've

816
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
got zeros for the non-smooth numbers and

817
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
one for the smooth numbers all we've got

818
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,640
is a bit strength who's a bit string

819
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
whose length is the length of the

820
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
interval

821
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
and then we move on to phase two which

822
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
is to check that bit string against our

823
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,880
pte solutions so in this case our pt

824
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
solution

825
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,679
was uh 0 3 5 11 13 16 in the first set

826
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,960
and the second set we've got some

827
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,320
repetition there 1 1 8 8 15 fifteen

828
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,360
so what that means is if we

829
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,320
move across this bit string with a uh

830
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,279
a window of length uh 17 from

831
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,159
the

832
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,799
the solutions from 0 through to 16.

833
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,600
um then we we shift this moving one at a

834
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,559
time

835
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,000
um until

836
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,080
all of those indices align with uh ones

837
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,520
that represent smooth numbers in the

838
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,640
interval

839
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,320
and in fact we don't have to shift by

840
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
one each time we can just move the arrow

841
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,520
above the zero to the very next one in

842
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
the in the bit string so we can

843
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,399
keep processing like that we start here

844
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,159
we see that not all of the arrows are

845
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
pointing to ones

846
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
we move to the next one we move the zero

847
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
to the next one

848
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,720
not all of the arrows there are pointing

849
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,159
to ones

850
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
we keep doing that

851
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,240
until

852
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
array we've got all of the arrows

853
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,520
pointing to ones and that means that

854
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
with this particular pte solution we've

855
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
found

856
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
two numbers

857
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,679
we've found a sorry in this case nine

858
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,919
numbers that are all smooth but when we

859
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
combine them according to those two

860
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
polynomials that correspond to our pte

861
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,519
solution

862
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,519
we're guaranteed that

863
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
we've got two uh integers that differ by

864
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
one that are both

865
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,399
be smooth

866
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,440
and so here they are we that corresponds

867
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,960
to this value of um this value of u here

868
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,320
um

869
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,679
and

870
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
in this case we also have that the sum

871
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
of the two twin smooths was a prime so

872
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,399
we've got alice with p plus 1 is 2 to

873
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
the 15 smooth and bob with p minus 1

874
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
also being 2 to the 15 smooth

875
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
so this is kind of the high level

876
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
summary of the results at least as far

877
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,760
as we'd be concerned within practice uh

878
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,919
we found a prime that was close to 256

879
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,720
bits

880
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,399
such that p plus or minus one were both

881
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,559
2 to the 15 smooth just like the one we

882
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,840
just saw we found one that was 384 bits

883
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
where that was sandwiched between two

884
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
numbers that are

885
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
2 to the 19 smooth and we found a 512

886
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,640
bit prime or prime close to 512 bits

887
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,440
where the uh p plus 1 and p minus 1 were

888
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,760
both 2 to the 28 smooth

889
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,039
there's of course a lot more in the

890
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,399
paper and i encourage you to take a look

891
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,080
at it

892
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
but

893
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,039
to finish up the future work we're

894
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,559
looking for for better methods of

895
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,200
finding twin smooths and of course at

896
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,440
any of those levels or at uh at

897
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,519
intermediate levels where we'd always be

898
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
interested in

899
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,720
any instances of smoother twins no

900
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,200
matter how they're found
